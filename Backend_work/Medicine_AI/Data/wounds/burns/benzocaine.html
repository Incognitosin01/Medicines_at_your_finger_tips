It works by blocking nerve signals in your body.</p><p>Benzodent cream numbs the skin or surfaces inside the mouth and gums and is used for the temporary relief of pain due to minor irritation caused by dentures or orthodontic appliances or injury.</p><p>Benzodent cream should not be used to treat teething pain in infants, and is not approved for use in a child younger than 2 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Benzodent used in the mouth may cause a condition in which the oxygen in the body tissues can become dangerously low. This is a potentially fatal condition called methemoglobinemia (met-HEEM-oh glo-bin-EE-mee-a). <b>Do not use this medicine if you have ever had methemoglobinemia.</b></p><p><b>GET EMERGENCY MEDICAL HELP IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS OF METHEMOGLOBINEMIA:</b> headache, tired feeling, confusion, fast heart rate, and feeling light-headed or short of breath, with a pale, blue, or gray appearance of your skin, lips, or fingernails.</p><p>An overdose of benzocaine can cause fatal side effects if too much benzocaine is absorbed through your skin or mouth and into your blood. Use the smallest amount needed.</p><p><b>Do not use Benzodent cream on a child younger than 2 years old.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Do not use Benzodent if you have ever had methemoglobinemia in the past.</p><p><b>An overdose of numbing medication can cause fatal side effects if too much of the medicine is absorbed through your skin or mouth and into your blood.</b> This can happen if you apply more than the recommended dose.</p><p>Fatal overdoses have occurred when numbing medicines were used without the advice of a medical doctor (such as during a cosmetic procedure like laser hair removal). Be aware that many cosmetic procedures are performed without a medical doctor present.</p><p>Ask a doctor or pharmacist if Benzodent cream is safe to use if you have:</p><ul>

Avoid using the medicine on areas that are raw or blistered, such as burn areas or abrasions.</p><p>Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse within the first 7 days of using Benzodent.
