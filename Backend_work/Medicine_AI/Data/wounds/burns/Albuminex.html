</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Albuminex Injection</h2><h3>Hypovolemia</h3><p class="First">ALBUMINEX 5% is indicated for restoration and maintenance of circulating blood volume where volume deficiency has been demonstrated, and use of a colloid is appropriate e.g. hypovolemia following shock due to trauma or sepsis, in surgical patients and in other similar conditions with volume deficiency when restoration and maintenance of circulating blood volume is required in both adult and pediatric patients. In pediatric patients to reverse hypovolemia and achieve normal capillary refill time. <span class="Sup">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8</span></p><h3>Ascites</h3><p class="First">ALBUMINEX 5% is indicated for prevention of central volume depletion and maintenance of cardiovascular function after large volume parencentesis in patients with liver cirrhosis or other chronic liver disease in adults and children. <span class="Sup">9, 10, 11, 12</span></p><p>ALBUMINEX 5% infusion plus administration of vasoactive drugs is indicated in the treatment of type I hepatorenal syndrome. <span class="Sup">6</span></p><p>For patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, ALBUMINEX 5% is indicated as adjuvant treatment to antibiotic therapy. <span class="Sup">9, 10, 13</span></p><h3>Hypoalbuminemia including from burns</h3><p class="First">ALBUMINEX 5% is indicated in patients with severe burn injury (&gt; 20% total body surface area), but not until at least 12 to 24 hours after the burn, in order to correct protein loss, decrease overall fluid requirements, decrease systemic edema and stabilize cardiovascular hemodynamics without fluid overload (initial resuscitation should be with crystalloids).<span class="Sup">8, 14</span> ALBUMINEX 5% is also indicated in patients with pre- or post-operative hypoproteinemia and for third space protein loss due to infection or burns.</p><h3>Acute Nephrosis</h3><p class="First">ALBUMINEX 5% is indicated in patients with acute nephrosis in combination with loop diuretics to reinforce the diuretic therapeutic effect, which is reduced by hypoalbuminemia, and for the correction of reduced oncotic pressure. <span class="Sup">15, 16</span></p><h3>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)</h3><p class="First">ALBUMINEX 5% is indicated in conjunction with diuretics to correct fluid volume overload associated with ARDS. <span class="Sup">17, 18, 19</span></p><h3>Cardiopulmonary Bypass</h3><p class="First">ALBUMINEX 5% is indicated in cardiopulmonary bypass procedures as part of the priming fluids to passivate the synthetic surfaces of the extracorporeal circuit and maintain the patient's colloid oncotic pressure. <span class="Sup">20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25</span></p><h2>Albuminex Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For intravenous administration only.</span></p><h3>Dosage</h3><p class="First">The concentration of ALBUMINEX 5% used, its dosage, and infusion rate should be adjusted to the patient's individual requirements and clinical indication.</p><h3>Administration</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</li>
<li>Do not use if there are any particulates seen or if the solution is discolored.</li>
<li>If a large volume is infused, ensure that the vial is at room temperature before infusion.</li>
<li>Do not dilute with Sterile Water for Injection as hemolysis may occur. ALBUMINEX 5% may be diluted with 0.9% saline or 5% dextrose.</li>
<li>Begin the infusion within 4 hours of piercing the vial stopper (the product does not contain any preservative).</li>
<li>Adjust the rate of infusion according to the individual patient's hemodynamic and other physiological responses, using appropriate clinical monitoring.</li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">ALBUMINEX 5% is a sterile, aqueous solution of human albumin (5% w/v i.e. 5 g/dL) for intravenous administration available as:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>250 mL (12.5 g) single dose vial</li>
<li>500 mL (25 g) single dose vial</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">ALBUMINEX 5% is contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Hypersensitivity to human albumin or any of the excipients</li>
<li>Severe anemia or cardiac failure with normal or increased intravascular volume</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Suspicion of allergic or anaphylactic reactions require immediate discontinuation of the infusion and implementation of appropriate medical treatment.</p><h3>Hypervolemia</h3><p class="First">Hypervolemia may occur if the dosage and rate of infusion are not adjusted to the patient's volume status. At the first clinical signs of cardiovascular overload (headache, dyspnea, jugular venous distention, increased blood pressure), the infusion must be slowed or stopped immediately.</p><p>Use albumin with caution in conditions where hypervolemia and its consequences or hemodilution could represent a special risk to the patient. Examples of such conditions are:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Decompensated heart failure</li>
<li>Hypertension</li>
<li>Esophageal varices</li>
<li>Pulmonary edema</li>
<li>Hemorrhagic diathesis</li>
<li>Severe anemia</li>
<li>Renal and post-renal anuria</li>
</ul><h3>Laboratory Parameters</h3><p class="First">When large volumes of albumin are being infused, control of coagulation parameters and hematocrit value is essential. Also, ensure adequate substitution of other blood constituents such as coagulation factors, electrolytes, platelets and erythrocytes, as appropriate.</p><h3>Clinical Hemodynamics Parameters</h3><p class="First">The colloid osmotic pressure of ALBUMINEX 5% is about the same as plasma.</p><p>The following parameters should be assessed during administration of ALBUMINEX 5%:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Arterial blood pressure and pulse rate</li>
<li>Central venous pressure</li>
<li>Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure</li>
<li>Urine output</li>
<li>Electrolytes</li>
<li>Hematocrit/hemoglobin</li>
</ul><h3>Pre-infusion Preparation</h3><p class="First">ALBUMINEX 5% must not be diluted with sterile water for injection as this may cause hemolysis in recipients. The product can be diluted in an isotonic solution (e.g., 5% dextrose in water or 0.9% sodium chloride) [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span>].</p><h3>Infectious Diseases</h3><p class="First">Albumin is a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases. A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is also considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been identified for ALBUMINEX 5%.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">In general, human albumin solutions are well-tolerated and no specific, clinically relevant alterations in organ function or coagulopathy have been substantiated. <span class="Sup">26</span></p><p>The most common adverse reactions associated with infusion of human albumin solutions are rigors, hypotension/decreased BP, tachycardia/increased heart rate, pyrexia, feeling cold (chills), nausea, vomiting, dyspnea/bronchospasm, rash/pruritus. Reactions usually resolve when the infusion is slowed or stopped.</p><p>Anaphylaxis, with or without shock, may occur and in this situation, stop the infusion.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">No clinical studies were done using ALBUMINEX 5%.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Do not mix ALBUMINEX 5% with blood, blood components, protein hydrolysates, alcoholic solutions or other medicinal products. Although it is not usually necessary to dilute Albuminex 5%, if it should be necessary, it may be diluted with 0.9% saline or 5% dextrose. However, it can be administered, via a separate IV line, concomitantly with other parenterals.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data with ALBUMINEX 5% use in pregnant women to inform on drug-associated risk. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted using ALBUMINEX 5%. It is not known whether ALBUMINEX 5% can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect fertility. ALBUMINEX 5% should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of ALBUMINEX 5% in human milk, the effects on the breast-fed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ALBUMINEX 5% and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed infant from ALBUMINEX 5% or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">No human or animal data. Use only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">No human or animal data. Use only if clearly needed.</p><h2>Albuminex Injection Description</h2><p class="First">ALBUMINEX 5% is a sterile, ready-for-use, clear, slightly viscous, almost colorless, yellow, amber or slightly green aqueous solution of human albumin for single dose intravenous infusion. It is prepared from the pooled plasma of US donors in FDA-licensed facilities in the US. The product also contains 130-160 mmol/L of sodium, less than 200 micrograms/L of aluminum and is stabilized with caprylate (0.08 mmol/g albumin) and acetyltryptophanate (0.08 mmol/g albumin) but does not contain any preservative.</p><p>12.5 g (250 mL) of ALBUMINEX 5% is oncotically equivalent to 250 mL plasma.</p><p>25 g (500 mL) of ALBUMINEX 5% is oncotically equivalent to 500 mL plasma.</p><p>The vials are closed with a synthetic rubber stopper. The stopper is not made with natural rubber latex.</p><p>The viral risk from human plasma is minimized by the fractionation process and pasteurization of the albumin solution for 10 hours at 60<span class="Bold">°</span>C (140<span class="Bold">°</span>F) in its final container. These processes are effective for both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. There have been no reports of virus transmission with products manufactured using this combination of processes.</p><p>Typical reductions of experimental viral loads are shown in Table 1.</p><h2>Albuminex Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Human albumin accounts for more than half of the total protein in the plasma and represents about 10% of protein synthesis activity by the liver.</p><p>The primary physiological function of albumin results from its contribution to plasma colloid oncotic pressure and transport function. Albumin stabilizes circulating blood volume and is a carrier of hormones, enzymes, medicinal products and toxins. Other physiological functions include antioxidant properties, free radical scavenging, and capillary membrane integrity.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Albumin is distributed throughout the extracellular space and more than 60% of the body albumin pool is located in the extravascular fluid compartment. Albumin has a circulating life span of 15-20 days, with a turnover of approximately 15 g per day. The balance between synthesis and breakdown is normally achieved by feedback regulation. Elimination is predominantly intracellular and due to lysosome proteases.</p><p>In healthy subjects, less than 10% of infused albumin leaves the intravascular compartment during the first 2 hours following infusion. There is considerable individual variation in the effect of albumin on plasma volume.</p><p>In some patients, the plasma volume can remain elevated for several hours. In critically ill patients, however, albumin can leak out of the vascular space in substantial amounts at an unpredictable rate.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">How ALBUMINEX 5% is supplied</span></p><p>ALBUMINEX 5%, 5 g/dL in clear Type II glass vials.</p><p>Not all pack sizes may be marketed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Storage and handling</span></p><p>Do not store above 30<span class="Bold">°</span>C (86<span class="Bold">°</span>F).</p><p>Keep the vial stored in the outer carton in order to protect from light.</p><p>Do not freeze.</p><p>Do not use ALBUMINEX 5% after the expiration date which is stated on the carton and label after "EXP."
