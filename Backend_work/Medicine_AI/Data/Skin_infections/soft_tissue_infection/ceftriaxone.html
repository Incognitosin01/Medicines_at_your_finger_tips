Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using ceftriaxone.</p><p><b>Ceftriaxone is usually mixed with a diluent to prepare it for use. Mixed medicine must be used within a certain number of hours or days.</b> This will depend on the diluent and how you store the mixture (at room temperature, in a refrigerator, or frozen). Carefully follow the mixing and storage instructions provided with your medicine. Ask your pharmacist if you have questions.</p><p>If your medicine was provided in a frozen form, thaw it in a refrigerator or at room temperature. Do not warm in a microwave or boiling water.
