Erythromycin belongs to a group of drugs called macrolide antibiotics. Macrolide antibiotics slow the growth of, or sometimes kill, sensitive bacteria by reducing the production of important proteins needed by the bacteria to survive.</p><p>Ery-Tab is used to treat or prevent many different types of infections caused by bacteria.</p><p>Ery-Tab may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Some medicines can cause unwanted or dangerous effects when used with Ery-Tab. Your doctor may need to change your treatment plan if you use cisapride, pimozide, ergotamine, or dihydroergotamine.</p><p>Before you take Ery-Tab, tell your doctor if you have liver disease, myasthenia gravis, a heart rhythm disorder, a history of Long QT syndrome, or low levels of potassium or magnesium in your blood.</p><p>Take Ery-Tab for the full prescribed length of time. Your symptoms may improve before the infection is completely cleared. Skipping doses may also increase your risk of further infection that is resistant to antibiotics.
