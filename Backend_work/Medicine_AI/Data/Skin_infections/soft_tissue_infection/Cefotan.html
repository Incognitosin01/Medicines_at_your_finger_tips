Use only the diluent your doctor has recommended.</p><p>After mixing your medicine, you will need to use it within a certain number of hours or days. This will depend on the diluent and how you store the mixture (at room temperature, in a refrigerator, or frozen). Carefully follow the mixing and storage instructions provided with your medicine. Ask your pharmacist if you have questions.</p><p><b>Do not use the medicine if it looks cloudy or has particles in it.</b> Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p>Use a disposable needle and syringe only once.
