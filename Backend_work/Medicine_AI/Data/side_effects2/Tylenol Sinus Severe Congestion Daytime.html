</ul><p class="ddc-notification"><b>Note:</b> This document contains side effect information about acetaminophen / guaifenesin / pseudoephedrine. Some of the dosage forms listed on this page <em>may not</em> apply to the brand name Tylenol Sinus Severe Congestion Daytime.</p><p><i>Applies to acetaminophen/guaifenesin/pseudoephedrine: oral tablet</i></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Two cases hypotension have been reported following the administration of acetaminophen.  Both patients experienced significant decreases in blood pressure.  One of the two patients required pressor agents to maintain adequate mean arterial pressures.  Neither episode was associated with symptoms of anaphylaxis.  Neither patient was rechallenged after resolution of the initial episode.</p><p></p><p>Pseudoephedrine may cause vasoconstriction which generally does not produce hypertension, but may be problematic for patients with preexisting hypertension.  Arrhythmias may be produced in predisposed patients.  Rarely, pseudoephedrine has been reported to cause coronary artery spasm and chest pain.  One report evaluated the effect with 60 mg of pseudoephedrine on individuals in a hyperbaric chamber at 1 atmosphere (simulated scuba dive to 66 feet of sea water).  Pseudoephedrine and depth (stimulated) were found to have significant but opposite effects on heart rate, although these effects were unlikely to be clinically significant during diving.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Cardiovascular side effects of acetaminophen have included two cases of hypotension.</p><p></p><p>Cardiovascular side effects of pseudoephedrine have included significant increases in heart rate.  Hypertension and arrhythmias have also been problematic in susceptible patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Hepatic side effects of acetaminophen have included severe and sometimes fatal dose dependent hepatitis in alcoholic patients.  Hepatotoxicity has been increased during fasting.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Alcoholic patients may develop hepatotoxicity after even modest doses of acetaminophen.  In healthy patients, approximately 15 grams of acetaminophen is necessary to deplete liver glutathione stores by 70% in a 70 kg person.  However, hepatotoxicity has been reported following smaller doses.  Glutathione concentrations may be repleted by the antidote N-acetylcysteine.  One case report has suggested that hypothermia may also be beneficial in decreasing liver damage during overdose.</p><p></p><p>In a recent retrospective study of 306 patients admitted for acetaminophen overdose, 6.9% had severe liver injury but all recovered.  None of the 306 patients died.</p><p></p><p>One study has suggested that acetaminophen may precipitate acute biliary pain and cholestasis.  The mechanism of this effect may be related to inhibition of prostaglandin and alterations in the regulation of the sphincter of Oddi.</p><p></p><p>Cases of acute pancreatitis have been reported rarely.</p><p></p><p>A 19-year-old female developed hepatotoxicity, reactive plasmacytosis and agranulocytosis followed by a leukemoid reaction after acute acetaminophen toxicity.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Alcoholic patients may develop hepatotoxicity after even modest doses of acetaminophen.  In healthy patients, approximately 15 grams of acetaminophen is necessary to deplete liver glutathione stores by 70% in a 70 kg person, although hepatotoxicity has been reported with smaller doses.  Glutathione concentrations may be repleted by the antidote N-acetylcysteine.  One case report has suggested that hypothermia may also be beneficial in decreasing liver damage during overdose.  Another study has suggested that acetaminophen may precipitate acute biliary pain and cholestasis.  The mechanism for this side effect may be related to inhibition of prostaglandins and alterations in the regulation of the sphincter of Oddi.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Gastrointestinal side effects of acetaminophen have been rare except in alcoholics and after overdose.</p><p></p><p>Gastrointestinal side effects of guaifenesin have included stomach upset and vomiting with higher than recommended doses.  Doses recommended for expectoration have rarely been associated with gastrointestinal upset.</p><p></p><p>Gastrointestinal side effects of pseudoephedrine have included anorexia and gastric irritation in approximately 5% of patients.  Dry mouth, nose, or throat have occurred in up to 15% of patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p>Renal side effects of acetaminophen have been rare and have included acute renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, and interstitial nephritis.  Adverse renal effects are most often observed after overdose, after chronic abuse (often with multiple analgesics), or in association with acetaminophen-related hepatotoxicity.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Acute tubular necrosis with acetaminophen usually occurs in conjunction with liver failure, but has been observed as an isolated finding in rare cases.  A possible increase in the risk of renal cell carcinoma has been associated with chronic acetaminophen use as well.</p><p></p><p>One case-control study of patients with end-stage renal disease suggested that long term consumption of acetaminophen may significantly increase the risk of end-stage renal disease particularly in patients taking more than two pills per day.</p><p></p><p>However, a recent cohort study of analgesia use of initially healthy men concluded that moderate use of analgesics including acetaminophen was not associated with increased risk of renal disease.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Hypersensitivity side effects of acetaminophen have included anaphylaxis and fixed drug eruptions.</p><p></p><p>Hypersensitivity side effects of pseudoephedrine have included fixed drug eruptions.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p>Hematologic side effects of acetaminophen have included rare cases of thrombocytopenia.  Methemoglobinemia with resulting cyanosis has also been observed in the setting of acute overdose.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Dermatologic side effects of acetaminophen have included rare reports of erythematous skin rashes.  Acetaminophen associated bullous erythema and purpura fulminans have been reported.  One case of toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with acetaminophen administered to a pediatric patient has been reported.  Acetaminophen has been associated with a risk of rare but potentially fatal serious skin reactions known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP).</p><p></p><p>Dermatologic side effects of guaifenesin have included rare reports of rash.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Respiratory</h3><p>Respiratory side effects of acetaminophen have included a case of eosinophilic pneumonia.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>In the case of metabolic acidosis, causality is uncertain as more than one drug was ingested.  The case of metabolic acidosis followed the ingestion of 75 grams of acetaminophen, 1.95 grams of aspirin, and a small amount of a liquid household cleaner  The patient also had a history of seizures which the authors reported may have contributed to an increased lactate level indicative of metabolic acidosis.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Metabolic side effects of acetaminophen have included metabolic acidosis following a massive overdose.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Nervous system side effects of guaifenesin have occasionally included dizziness and headache.</p><p></p><p>Nervous system side effects of pseudoephedrine have included insomnia in up to 30% of patients.  Tremor, anxiety, nervousness, and headache have also been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1.
