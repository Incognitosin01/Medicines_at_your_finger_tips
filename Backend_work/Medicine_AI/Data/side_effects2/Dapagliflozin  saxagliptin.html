<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to dapagliflozin / saxagliptin: oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>The more commonly reported adverse reactions have been upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and dyslipidemia.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p>Dapagliflozin-Saxagliptin</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Renal impairment</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dapagliflozin:</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Serum creatinine increases, eGFR decreases</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Acute kidney injury<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>With this therapy, adverse reactions related to decreased renal function occurred in 2% of patients and included decreased glomerular filtration rate, renal impairment, increased blood creatinine, acute renal failure, and decreased urine output.  None of the events were serious.  Three subjects discontinued therapy due to decreased eGFR.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, have been received in patients receiving dapagliflozin.  Some cases have occurred in non-elderly patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Genitourinary</h3><p>The majority of genital infections were in females; reported genital infections included vulvovaginal mycotic infection, balanoposthitis, genital fungal infection, vaginal infection, and vulvovaginitis.  The majority of urinary tract infections were also in females and included urinary tract infections, Escherichia urinary tract infection, prostatitis, and pyelonephritis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the 5 years (2013 to 2018) since SGLT2 inhibitor approval, 12 cases of Fournier's gangrene have been reported.  Reports were almost equal in men and women (men=7; women=5), ages ranged from 38 to 78 years, and the average time to onset after starting an SGLT2 inhibitor was 9.2 months (range 7 days to 25 months).  All SGLT2 inhibitor drugs except ertugliflozin were included in the reports.  Ertugliflozin being the most recently approved agent, is expected to have the same risk, but insufficient patient use to assess risk.  All patients were hospitalized, all required surgery, all required surgical debridement, 5 required more than 1 surgery and 1 required skin grafting.  Four cases were complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, and septic shock, leading to prolonged hospitalization, and death in 1 case.  In the general population, Fournier's gangrene occurs in about 1.6 out of 100,000 males annually, with the highest incidence in men 50 to 79 years.  Since diabetes is a risk factor for Fournier's gangrene, a review of the FAERS database for the last 34 years was done and only 6 cases (all males, median age 57 years) were found with several other classes of antidiabetic drugs.  Findings with SGLT2 inhibitors appear to show an association over a shorter time frame and involve both males and females.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Dapagliflozin-Saxagliptin: </p>

<p>In a saxagliptin cardiovascular outcomes trial among patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or with multiple risk factors for ASCVD, hospitalization for heart failure occurred in 3.5% (289/8280) of patients receiving saxagliptin compared to 2.8% (228/8212) of patients receiving placebo.  Hospitalization, irrespective of treatment, occurred more frequently among patients with renal impairment and a history of heart failure.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Dapagliflozin-Saxagliptin: </p>

After excluding cases in which exposure to drug was less than 1 year, 4 cases occurred in the dapagliflozin group and no cases in comparator/placebo group.  Due to the low numbers, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether this is attributable to dapagliflozin nor is there data to determine whether there is an effect on preexisting bladder tumors.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Dapagliflozin </p>
