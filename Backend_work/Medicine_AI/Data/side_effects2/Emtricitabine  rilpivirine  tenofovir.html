<p>During phase 3 trials, an increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR were seen over 96 weeks of therapy with rilpivirine.  Most of these changes occurred within the first 4 weeks of therapy, with a mean change of 0.1 mg/dL (range: -0.3 to 0.6 mg/dL) for creatinine and -13.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range: -63.7 to 40.1 mL/min/1.73 m2) for eGFR observed after 96 weeks of therapy.
