HBV reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals and were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, glecaprevir / pibrentasvir may cause some unwanted effects.

<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to glecaprevir / pibrentasvir: oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>The most common side effects reported with this drug in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients without cirrhosis were headache, fatigue, and nausea.  The most common side effects reported in HCV-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) were fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, and pruritus.  The most common side effects reported in HCV-infected patients with severe renal dysfunction were pruritus, fatigue, nausea, asthenia, and headache.  The most common side effects reported in HCV/HIV-1-coinfected patients were fatigue, nausea, and headache.  The most common side effects reported in HCV-infected patients with liver or kidney transplant were headache, fatigue, nausea, and pruritus.  The most common side effects reported in HCV-infected patients who inject drugs (currently/recently [within the last 12 months prior to therapy]) were fatigue, headache, diarrhea, and nausea.  The most common side effects reported in HCV-infected patients with concomitant use of medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder were headache, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Headache (up to 17%)</p>

<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Angioedema<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Elevated bilirubin (up to 17%)</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Elevated total bilirubin</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Direct hyperbilirubinemia</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Jaundice</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Hepatic decompensation, hepatic failure<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Elevated total bilirubin (at least 2 times the upper limit of normal [2 x ULN]) was reported in 3.5% of patients; such elevations were seen in 1.2% of patients across phase 2 and 3 trials and were related to glecaprevir-mediated inhibition of bilirubin transporters and metabolism.  Bilirubin elevations were asymptomatic, transient, and generally occurred early during therapy; these elevations were mainly indirect and not associated with ALT elevations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), 17% reported early, transient postbaseline bilirubin elevations above the ULN; these elevations were normally less than 2 x ULN, usually occurred with the first 2 weeks of therapy, and resolved with continued therapy.  Patient with compensated cirrhosis and elevated bilirubin did not have concomitant increases in ALT/AST or signs of liver decompensation/failure; these laboratory events did not result in discontinuation of therapy.  Few patients reported jaundice or ocular icterus and total bilirubin levels decreased after completion of therapy.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Fatigue (up to 16%)</p>
