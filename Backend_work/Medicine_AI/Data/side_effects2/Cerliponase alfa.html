No patients discontinued therapy due to hypersensitivity.  The most common manifestations included pyrexia with vomiting, pleocytosis, or irritability, which are inconsistent with classic immune mediated hypersensitivity.  These reactions were observed during or within 24 hours after the infusion and did not interfere with treatment.  Symptoms resolved over time or with administration of antipyretics, antihistamines and/or glucocorticosteroids.</p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Hypersensitivity reactions (58%)</p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Seizures occurred in 12 of 24 patients; seizure types included atonic, generalized tonic-clonic, focal, and absence seizure.

<p>Hypotension was reported in 2 patients; these patients did not require treatment alterations as reactions resolved spontaneously or after IV fluids.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Local</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Device-related complication (50%)</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Device-related infection<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Device-related adverse reactions occurred in 50% of symptomatic pediatric patients during clinical studies and included infection (e.g., Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis), deliver system-related complications, and pleocytosis.
