The process may lead to severe thromboembolic complications like skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, stroke, and possibly death.  Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of 0 to 30%.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Hypersensitivity side effects include the remote possibility of hypersensitivity reaction from the entry of extremely small subtherapeutic amounts of the heparin flush (the active ingredient contained in PosiFlush) solution into the circulation.  Such an occurrence has not been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1. "Product Information. Heparin Lock Flush (heparin flush)."
