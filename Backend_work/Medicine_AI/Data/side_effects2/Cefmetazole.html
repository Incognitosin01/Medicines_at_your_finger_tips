</ul><p><i>Applies to cefmetazole: injectable powder for injection, intravenous solution</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>Cefmetazole has been generally well tolerated.  In large studies only 2% to 4% of patients reported side effects.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Rare cases of pseudomembranous colitis have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain which were reported in up to 4% of patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Hepatic side effects have included rare reports of mild increases in liver function tests.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Rare cases of cholestatic jaundice have been reported.</p><p></p><p>Mild increases in liver function tests may be important in patients with liver disease<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Hypersensitivity side effects have included rare reports of a rash (less than 1% of patients).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Rare cases of anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity hepatitis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported.</p><p></p><p>A case of occupational contact dermatitis due to cephalosporin allergy has been reported in a nurse who prepared cephalosporin solutions for administration to patients.  The dermatitis resolved after the nurse stopped preparing the solutions.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p>Although mild, insignificant hypoprothrombinemia has been reported.  However, no clinically significant hemorrhage or increased bleeding times have been documented.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Hematologic side effects have included very rare reports of thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, anemia, and eosinophilia.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Cardiovascular side effects have included informal reports of hypotension and shock, but the type of infection and clinical conditions of the patients made implication of cefmetazole difficult.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p>The use of glucose oxidase methods (e.g.,Testape, Keto-Diastix, and Chemstrip) to measure urine glucose is recommended during therapy.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Other side effects have included a possible overestimation of urine glucose by the copper reduction method of urine dipstick analysis (Clinitest).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p>Renal side effects have included reports of new or worsened renal insufficiency.  These were difficult to interpret due to underlying diseases and concomitant therapy.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1.
