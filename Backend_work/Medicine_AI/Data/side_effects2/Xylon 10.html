<li>Professional</li></ul><p class="ddc-notification"><b>Note:</b> This document contains side effect information about hydrocodone / ibuprofen. Some of the dosage forms listed on this page <em>may not</em> apply to the brand name Xylon 10.</p><h2>In Summary</h2><p><b>Common side effects of Xylon 10 include:</b> drowsiness and dyspepsia.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to hydrocodone / ibuprofen: oral tablet</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet)</p><p>Addiction, Abuse, and MisuseHydrocodone bitartrate/ibuprofen exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing hydrocodone bitartrate/ibuprofen, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions.Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products.Life-Threatening Respiratory DepressionSerious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of  hydrocodone bitartrate/ibuprofen. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of hydrocodone bitartrate/ibuprofen or following a dose increase.Accidental IngestionAccidental ingestion of even one dose of hydrocodone bitartrate/ibuprofen, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of hydrocodone bitartrate.Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal SyndromeProlonged use of hydrocodone bitartrate/ibuprofen during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.Cytochrome P450 3A4 InteractionThe concomitant use of hydrocodone bitartrate/ibuprofen with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in hydrocodone plasma concentrations, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in hydrocodone plasma concentration. Monitor patients taking hydrocodone bitartrate/ibuprofen and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or upon discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines or Other CNS DepressantsConcomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of hydrocodone bitartrate/ibuprofen and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.Cardiovascular Thrombotic EventsNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and increase with duration of use. Hydrocodone bitartrate/ibuprofen is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and PerforationNSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, hydrocodone / ibuprofen may cause some unwanted effects.
