<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to atazanavir / cobicistat: oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>In a clinical trial (based on week 144 data), safety of this drug was evaluated in HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naive patients using the individual components with other antiretrovirals.  In this trial, patients received atazanavir and cobicistat with emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) (cobicistat-boosted group) or atazanavir and ritonavir with emtricitabine-tenofovir DF (ritonavir-boosted group).  In the cobicistat-boosted group, the most commonly reported side effects were associated with elevated bilirubin levels; the most common side effects (grades 2 to 4) were jaundice and rash.  Study treatment was discontinued due to side effects in 11% of patients in both the cobicistat- and the ritonavir-boosted groups.  Most of the side effects included from clinical trials were of at least moderate intensity (grade 2 or higher).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The manufacturer product information for atazanavir and cobicistat should be consulted for additional safety information.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>In 1 study through 144 weeks of therapy, hyperbilirubinemia was reported in 97.7% and 97.4% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted and ritonavir-boosted groups, respectively; however, more patients in the cobicistat-boosted group had increases in total bilirubin greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal (2 x ULN) than patients in the ritonavir-boosted group (88% versus 80.9%).  Study drug was discontinued due to bilirubin-related side effects in 4.9% and 4% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted and ritonavir-boosted groups, respectively.  Increased ALT or AST greater than 3 x ULN was reported in 12.8% and 9% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted and ritonavir-boosted groups, respectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Increases in total bilirubin greater than 2.5 x ULN was reported in 73% and 66% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted and ritonavir-boosted groups, respectively.  Increased ALT (greater than 5 x ULN), AST (greater than 5 x ULN), and GGT (greater than 5 x ULN) were reported in 6%, 4%, and 4% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group, respectively, and 3%, 3%, and 2% of patients in the ritonavir-boosted group, respectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jaundice (grades 2 to 4) was reported in 6% and 3% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted and ritonavir-boosted groups, respectively.</p>

<p>Most patients taking atazanavir experienced asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UGT.  This hyperbilirubinemia was reversible upon discontinuation of atazanavir.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Hyperbilirubinemia (97.7%), increased total bilirubin (up to 88%), jaundice (up to 13%), increased ALT or AST (12.8%)</p>
