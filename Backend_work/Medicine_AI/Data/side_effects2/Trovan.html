</ul><p class="ddc-notification"><b>Note:</b> This document contains side effect information about trovafloxacin. Some of the dosage forms listed on this page <em>may not</em> apply to the brand name Trovan.</p><p><i>Applies to trovafloxacin: intravenous solution, oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>In clinical trials, 90% of side effects were reported as mild or moderate.  Therapy was discontinued due to side effects in 5% of patients, including dizziness (2.4%), nausea (1.9%), headache (1.1%), vomiting (1%).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Hepatic side effects have included 5 deaths from liver toxicity and 4 patients requiring liver transplantation (one of which died) out of 140 cases of liver toxicity reported since the approval of trovafloxacin (the active ingredient contained in Trovan) in February 1998.  Symptomatic hepatitis (sometimes associated with peripheral eosinophilia, liver failure (including acute hepatic necrosis with eosinophilic infiltration) have been reported.  Increased liver enzymes, abnormal hepatic function, bilirubinemia, discolored feces, and jaundice have been reported in less than 1% of patients.  Increased ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase have been reported in 1% or more of patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Liver enzyme abnormalities and/or symptomatic hepatitis have occurred during short-term or long-term therapy.  Liver enzyme abnormalities were primarily observed in patients receiving extended courses of therapy (longer than 21 days).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Nervous system side effects have included dizziness (2% to 11%), headache (1% to 5%), and lightheadedness (&lt;1% to 4%).  Abnormal coordination, abnormal gait, ataxia, cold clammy skin, confusion, convulsions, dry mouth, dyskinesia, dysphonia, encephalopathy, flushing, hyperkinesia, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, hypokinesia, increased saliva, increased sweating, involuntary muscle contractions, migraine, paresthesia, speech disorder, tongue paralysis, tremor, and vertigo have been reported in less than 1% of patients.  Peripheral neuropathy has also been reported.  Quinolone class antibiotics have been associated with possible exacerbation of myasthenia gravis.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>A case of alatrofloxacin related seizure activity has been reported in the medical literature.  The patient was given alatrofloxacin at the manufacturer's recommended dosage, concentration, and rate of infusion.  Fifteen minutes into the infusion, the patient experienced generalized tonic movement of the upper torso which lasted 10 seconds.  A rechallenge was performed, this time at a rate twice as slow as the initial dose.  The patient experienced jaw and arm twitching, and alatrofloxacin was discontinued.  The authors determined that the causal relationship between the drug and the event qualified as probable based on the Naranjo adverse event scoring method.</p><p></p><p>Dizziness or lightheadedness may last for several hours after a dose; however, is generally mild.  It may resolve with continued therapy.  3.1% and 0.6% of patients over 65 years, respectively, reported dizziness and lightheadedness.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea (4% to 8%), vomiting (1% to 3%), diarrhea (2%), and abdominal pain (1%).
