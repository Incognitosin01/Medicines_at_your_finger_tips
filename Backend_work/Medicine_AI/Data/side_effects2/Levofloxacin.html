<li>FAQ</li></ul><h2>In Summary</h2><p><b>More frequently reported side effects include:</b> diarrhea and insomnia.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><p><b>WARNINGS:</b> Levofloxacin may rarely cause tendon damage (such as tendinitis, tendon rupture) during or after treatment. Your risk for tendon problems is greater if you are over 60 years of age, if you are taking corticosteroids (such as prednisone), or if you have had a kidney, heart or lung transplant. Stop exercising, rest, and get medical help right away if you develop joint/muscle/tendon pain or swelling.</p><p>Levofloxacin should not be used in patients with myasthenia gravis. It may cause the condition to become worse. Seek immediate medical attention if you develop muscle weakness or trouble breathing.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to levofloxacin: oral solution, oral tablet</i></p><p>Other dosage forms:</p><ul><li>intravenous solution</li></ul><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet; Solution)</p><p>Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, are associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions that have occurred together, including tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and CNS effects. Discontinue levofloxacin and avoid use of fluoroquinolones in patients with these serious adverse reactions. Reserve use of levofloxacin for patients with no alternative treatment options for an uncomplicated UTI, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, or acute bacterial sinusitis. Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, levofloxacin may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>
