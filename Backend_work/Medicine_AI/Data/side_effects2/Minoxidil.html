 <h1>Minoxidil Side Effects</h1><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Consumer</li>
<li>Professional</li></ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to minoxidil: oral tablet</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet)</p><p>Minoxidil can cause pericardial effusion, occasionally progressing to tamponade, and angina pectoris may be exacerbated. Minoxidil should be reserved for hypertensive patients who do not respond adequately to maximum therapeutic doses of a diuretic and two other antihypertensive agents. Minoxidil must be administered under close supervision, usually concomitantly with therapeutic doses of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent to prevent tachycardia and increased myocardial workload. It must also usually be given with a diuretic, frequently one acting in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, to prevent serious fluid accumulation. Patients with malignant hypertension and those already receiving guanethidine should be hospitalized when minoxidil is first administered so that they can be monitored to avoid too rapid, or large orthostatic, decreases in blood pressure.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, minoxidil may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>
<b>Check with your doctor immediately</b> if any of the following side effects occur while taking minoxidil:</p><p>
<i>More common</i>
</p><ul>
<li>Fast or irregular heartbeat</li>
<li>weight gain (rapid) of more than 5 pounds (2 pounds in children)</li>
</ul><p>
<i>Less common</i>
</p><ul>
<li>Chest pain</li>
<li>shortness of breath</li>
</ul><p>Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur while taking minoxidil:</p><p>
<i>More common</i>
</p><ul>
<li>Bloating</li>
<li>flushing or redness of skin </li>
<li>swelling of feet or lower legs</li>
</ul><p>
<i>Less common</i>
</p><ul>
<li>Numbness or tingling of hands, feet, or face</li>
</ul><p>
<i>Rare</i>
</p><ul>
<li>Skin rash and itching</li>
</ul><h3>Side effects not requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Some side effects of minoxidil may occur that usually <b>do not need medical attention</b>. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects.</p><p>Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects <b>continue or are bothersome</b> or if you have any questions about them:</p><p>
<i>More common</i>
</p><ul>
<li>Increase in hair growth, usually on face, arms, and back</li>
</ul><p>
<i>Less common or rare</i>
</p><ul>
<li>Breast tenderness in males and females</li>
<li> headache</li>
</ul><p>This medicine causes a temporary increase in hair growth in most people. Hair may grow longer and darker in both men and women. This may first be noticed on the face several weeks after you start taking minoxidil. Later, new hair growth may be noticed on the back, arms, legs, and scalp. Talk to your doctor about shaving or using a hair remover during this time. After treatment with minoxidil has ended, the hair will stop growing, although it may take several months for the new hair growth to go away.</p><p>
