<li>Professional</li></ul><p class="ddc-notification"><b>Note:</b> This document contains side effect information about albiglutide. Some of the dosage forms listed on this page <em>may not</em> apply to the brand name Tanzeum.</p><h2>In Summary</h2><p><b>Common side effects of Tanzeum include:</b> injection site reaction, diarrhea, and nausea. <b>Other side effects include:</b> vomiting.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to albiglutide: subcutaneous powder for solution</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Subcutaneous route (Powder for Solution)</p><p>Carcinogenicity of albiglutide could not be assessed in rodents, but other glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have caused thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents at clinically relevant exposures. Human relevance of GLP-1 receptor agonist induced C-cell tumors in rodents has not been determined. It is unknown whether albiglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans. Albiglutide is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Counsel patients about the potential risk of MTC with the use of albiglutide and inform them of the symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound monitoring is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, albiglutide (the active ingredient contained in Tanzeum) may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>
