Seven cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma were in liraglutide-treated patients and 1 case in a comparator-treated patient.  Most were less than 1 cm in greatest diameter and diagnosed in surgical pathology specimens after thyroidectomy prompted by findings on protocol-specified screening with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound.  Seven malignant neoplasm events were reported beyond 1-year exposure to study medication: 4 colon, 1 prostate and 1 nasopharyngeal in liraglutide-treated patients with 1 (colon) reported in a comparator-treated patient.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Liraglutide: </p>

In doses of up to 3 mg, cholelithiasis and cholecystitis were reported in 1.5% (vs 0.5%) and 0.6% (vs 0.2%), respectively (compared to placebo).  The majority of patients with cholelithiasis and cholecystitis require cholecystectomy.  In the cardiovascular outcomes trial, liraglutide-treated patients reported an acute event of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis more frequently than those receiving placebo (3.6% vs 1.9%).
