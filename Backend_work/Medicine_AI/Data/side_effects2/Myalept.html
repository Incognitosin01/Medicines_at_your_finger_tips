<li>Professional</li></ul><p class="ddc-notification"><b>Note:</b> This document contains side effect information about metreleptin. Some of the dosage forms listed on this page <em>may not</em> apply to the brand name Myalept.</p><h2>In Summary</h2><p><b>More frequent side effects include:</b> proteinuria and urticaria.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to metreleptin: subcutaneous powder for solution</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Subcutaneous route (Powder for Solution)</p><p>Anti-metreleptin antibodies with neutralizing activity have been identified in patients treated with metreleptin. The consequences are not well characterized but could include inhibition of endogenous leptin action and/or loss of metreleptin efficacy. Severe infection and/or worsening metabolic control have been reported. Test for anti-metreleptin antibodies with neutralizing activity in patients who develop severe infections or show signs suspicious for loss of metreleptin efficacy during treatment. T-cell lymphoma has been reported in patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy, both treated and not treated with metreleptin. Carefully consider the benefits and risks of treatment with metreleptin in patients with significant hematologic abnormalities and/or acquired generalized lipodystrophy. Metreleptin is available only through a restricted program called the Myalept(TM) REMS Program.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, metreleptin (the active ingredient contained in Myalept) may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>
