Associated rash usually progressed to desquamation.  Liver biopsy has shown necrosis and infiltration with moderate number of inflammatory cells.  Noncaseating granulomas have also been seen.  Hepatitis generally resolved over several weeks after therapy discontinuation, although some patients progressed to fulminant hepatic failure.</p>

In one review of 62 cases of sulfasalazine-induced agranulocytosis, 6.5% of patients died.  Recovery of granulocytes was generally seen within 1 to 2 weeks after drug discontinuation, and leukocyte counts and differential returned to normal in 1 to 3 weeks.
