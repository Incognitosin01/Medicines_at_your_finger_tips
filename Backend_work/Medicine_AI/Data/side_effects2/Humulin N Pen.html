      WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug. Tell your
      doctor or get medical help right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms that may be related to a very bad side effect:
    </p><ul>
<li>Signs of an allergic reaction, like rash; hives; itching; red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin with or without fever; wheezing;
      tightness in the chest or throat; trouble breathing, swallowing, or talking; unusual hoarseness; or swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue,
      or throat.
      </li>
<li>Signs of low potassium levels like muscle pain or weakness, muscle cramps, or a heartbeat that does not feel normal.
      </li>
<li>Change in eyesight.
      </li>
<li>A burning, numbness, or tingling feeling that is not normal.
      </li>

      </li>
<li>Low blood sugar may occur. Signs may be dizziness, headache, feeling sleepy, feeling weak, shaking, a fast heartbeat, confusion, hunger, or
      sweating. Call the doctor right away if any of these signs occur. Follow what you have been told to do if low blood sugar occurs. This may
      include taking glucose tablets, liquid glucose, or some fruit juices.

      What are some other side effects of this drug?
    </h2><p>
      All drugs may cause side effects. However, many people have no side effects or only have minor side effects. Call your doctor or get medical

    </p><ul>
<li>Irritation where the shot is given.
      </li>
<li>Weight gain.
      </li>
</ul><p>

Combination use with thiazolidinediones has resulted in fluid retention which has led to or exacerbated heart failure.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Lipodystrophy<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Long-term use of insulin can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections.  Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissues).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>General</h3><p>The most common adverse reactions reported with this insulin include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, weight gain, and edema.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Local reactions such as redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site</p><p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Anaphylactic reactions<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Hypersensitivity side effects have included both local and systemic reactions.  These reactions are becoming rare (less than 1% of patients) due to the use of purer forms of pork insulin or biosynthetic human insulin.  Local reactions have presented as erythema, swelling, heat, or subcutaneous nodules.  They usually occurred within the first two weeks of therapy and then disappear.  True allergy to insulin has been rare, and sensitization was usually associated with specific animal proteins in bovine and less pure forms of porcine insulins.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Immunologic</h3><p>Increases in titers of anti-insulin antibodies that react with human insulin have been observed; some data indicates the increase is transient.  The clinical significance of these antibodies is unknown; it does not appear to cause deterioration in glycemic control.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Formation of anti-insulin antibodies<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Hypoglycemia</p><p><b>Rare</b> (less than 0.1%): Insulin resistance</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic syndrome, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulin therapies.  The timing of hypoglycemia generally reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin, however, the time action profile of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or at different times in the same individual depending on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity.  Other factors such as changes in food intake (timing of meals, amount or type of food) and concomitant medications will also affect the risk of hypoglycemia.  </p><p></p><p>Hypokalemia, which is due to a shift in potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space, occurs with all insulins.  Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia has been reported, particularly in patients treated for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).  Insulin increases the intracellular transport of phosphate, which often results in hypophosphatemia during treatment of DKA.  In situations in which not enough insulin is available to control blood glucose, hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic syndrome may occur.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Ocular</h3><p>Transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder and worsening of diabetic retinopathy has been reported with insulin initiation and glucose control intensification.  Over the long-term, improved glycemic control decreases the risk for diabetic neuropathy.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening diabetic neuropathy<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Local</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Injection site hypertrophy</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Injection site reactions<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Injection site reactions including pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling, and itching have occurred.  These usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks; rotation of the injection site reduces the risk of these reactions developing.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Acute painful peripheral neuropathy has been reported with insulin initiation and glucose control intensification.  Over the long-term, improved glycemic control decreases the risk for neuropathy.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Acute painful peripheral neuropathy<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Weight gain<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Weight gain can occur with insulin use; it is believed to be due to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1.
