Cross-reactivity in penicillin-allergic patients may occur.  Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, serum sickness-like reactions, and anaphylactic shock have been reported during postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Diarrhea and loose stools may be dose-related and has been reported in 10.4% of patients taking 800 mg cefpodoxime per day, compared to 5.7% of patients taking 200 mg per day.  Ten percent of these patients tested positive Clostridium difficile organisms or toxins.</p>

<p>C difficile was isolated in six of six volunteers given cefpodoxime for 10 days compared with one of six volunteers given placebo.  The symptoms associated with C difficile were mild and did not result in withdrawal from the study.  The excretion of C difficile in the stool was not statistically associated with the passage of loose stools and none of the subjects went on to develop pseudomembranous colitis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In postmarketing experience reports, one death was attributed to pseudomembranous colitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Gastrointestinal side effects have included diarrhea (7%), nausea (3.3%), and abdominal pain (1.2%).
