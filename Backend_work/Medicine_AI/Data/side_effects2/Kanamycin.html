</ul><p><i>Applies to kanamycin: compounding powder, injectable solution, oral capsule</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>The major toxic effects associated with kanamycin therapy are ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.  It is considered one of the more toxic aminoglycosides.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Nervous system side effects have included neuromuscular blockade, ototoxicity resulting in loss of vestibular function secondary to hair cell damage, and irreversible or partially reversible bilateral hearing loss.  Nystagmus, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and acute Meniere's syndrome are signs of vestibular dysfunction.  Cochlear damage may be asymptomatic and may initially manifest as minor changes in audiometric test results at higher frequencies. Aminoglycosides have been associated with acute muscular paralysis, apnea, peripheral neuropathy and encephalopathy (numbness, paresthesia, muscle twitching, seizures), and myasthenia gravis-like syndrome.  Neurotoxicity may occur after intrapleural, intraperitoneal, or parenteral administration.  Patients with renal impairment may be at a higher risk.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p>Renal side effects have included nephrotoxicity, albuminuria, presence of red and white cells and granular casts, azotemia, oliguria, and increased serum creatinine and BUN.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Dermatologic reactions have included skin rash.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Local</h3><p>Local reactions have included pain at the injection site after intramuscular injection.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>Metabolic side effects associated with prolonged kanamycin treatment have included malabsorption syndrome manifested as increased fecal fat, decreased serum carotene, and decreased xylose absorption.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1.
