Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing pentazocine and naloxone tablets, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors or conditions.</p><p> To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA has required a REMS for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant eduction programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to complete a REMS-compliant education program, counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products, emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacist, and consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety.</p><p>Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of pentazocine and naloxone tablets. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of pentazocine and naloxone tablets or following a dose increase.</p><p>Accidental ingestion of even one dose of pentazocine and naloxone tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of pentazocine.</p><p>Prolonged use of pentazocine and naloxone tablets during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.</p><p>Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of pentazocine and naloxone tablets or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, naloxone / pentazocine may cause some unwanted effects.
