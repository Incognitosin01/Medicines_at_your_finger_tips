Administer the initial dose of pegvaliase-pqpz under the supervision of a healthcare provider equipped to manage anaphylaxis, and closely observe patients for at least 60 minutes following injection. Prior to self-injection, confirm patient competency with self-administration, and patient’s and observer’s ability to recognize signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and to administer auto-injectable epinephrine, if needed. Prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine. Prior to first dose, instruct the patient and observer (if applicable) on its appropriate use. Instruct the patient to seek immediate medical care upon its use. Instruct patients to carry auto-injectable epinephrine with them at all times during pegvaliase-pqpz treatment. Pegvaliase-pqpz is available only through a restricted program called the Palynziq(TM) REMS.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, pegvaliase (the active ingredient contained in Palynziq) may cause some unwanted effects.
