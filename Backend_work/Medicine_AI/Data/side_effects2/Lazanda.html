Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or following a dose increase. Due to the risk of fatal respiratory depression, fentanyl sublingual spray is contraindicated in opioid non-tolerant patients and in management of acute or postoperative pain, including headache/migraines.Accidental ingestion of fentanyl sublingual spray, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. Keep out of reach of children. Ensure proper storage and disposal.Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers) can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl.Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.When prescribing, do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from any other oral transmucosal fentanyl product to fentanyl sublingual spray.When dispensing, do not substitute with any other fentanyl products.Fentanyl sublingual spray exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess patient’s risk before prescribing and monitor regularly for these behaviors and conditions.Fentanyl sublingual spray is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors are required to enroll in the program.Prolonged use of fentanyl sublingual spray during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. If prolonged opioid use is required in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available..</p><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Buccal mucosa route (Film; Lozenge/Troche; Tablet)</p><p>Due to the risk of fatal respiratory depression, transmucosal fentanyl citrate is contraindicated in opioid non-tolerant patients and in management of acute or postoperative pain, including headache/migraines.
