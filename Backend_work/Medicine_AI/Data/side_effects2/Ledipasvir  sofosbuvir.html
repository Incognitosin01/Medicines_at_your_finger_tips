<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to ledipasvir / sofosbuvir: oral pellet, oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>The most common side effects reported with this drug were fatigue, headache, asthenia, and nausea.  When this drug was studied with ribavirin, the most common side effects to this combination were consistent with known ribavirin side effects; frequency and severity of the expected side effects were not increased.  Therapy was permanently discontinued due to side effects in 0%, less than 1%, and 1% of patients using this drug for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively, and less than 1%, 0%, and 2% for patients using this drug with ribavirin for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Among 174 liver transplant recipients with compensated liver disease using this drug with ribavirin for 12 weeks, 1% permanently discontinued this drug due to a side effect.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Among 162 patients with decompensated liver disease (pretransplant or posttransplant) using this drug with ribavirin for 12 weeks, 4% died, 2% had a liver transplantation, and less than 1% had a liver transplantation and died during therapy or within 30 days after stopping therapy.  Due to the advanced liver disease in these patients (who had increased risk of disease progression leading to liver failure and death), the contribution of drug effect to outcomes could not be reliably assessed.  This drug was permanently discontinued due to a side effect in 2% of patients.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The most common side effect in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) with compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis) and severe renal dysfunction was fatigue.  The most common side effects in patients with HCV with compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis) and end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were insomnia and headache.</p>
