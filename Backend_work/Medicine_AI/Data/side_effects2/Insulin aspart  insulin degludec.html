</ul><p><i>Applies to insulin aspart/insulin degludec: subcutaneous solution</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, edema, and weight gain.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>Weight gain, attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin, has been reported.  In clinical trials, an average weight gain of 1.6 kg and 2.8 kg was reported in patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Hypoglycemia (up to 95%)</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Weight gain<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Immunologic</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Influenza</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Anti-insulin antibodies<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>The detection of antibodies is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors such as assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease.  Therefore, comparison of the incidence of antibodies may be misleading.  In a study in insulin-experienced patients with type 1 diabetes receiving insulin degludec/insulin aspart, 13% were positive for anti-insulin aspart antibodies at least once during the study, including 6.4% who were positive at baseline.  For insulin degludec, in adult insulin experienced type 1 diabetes patients, 63.5% of patients receiving this insulin were positive at baseline for anti-insulin degludec antibodies and 15.4% developed anti-insulin degludec antibodies at least once during the study.  In immunogenic trials, 99.4% to 100% of patients who were positive for anti-insulin degludec antibodies were also positive for anti-human insulin antibodies.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>In clinical trials, peripheral edema was reported in 2.2% and 1.8% of patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Peripheral edema<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Hypersensitivity manifested with swelling of tongue and lips, diarrhea, nausea, tiredness and itching; urticaria<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Local</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Injection site reactions including hematoma, pain, hemorrhage, erythema, nodules, swelling, discoloration, pruritus, warmth, and injection site mass</p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Lipodystrophy<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Respiratory</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Nasopharyngitis (up to 24.6%)</p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Upper respiratory tract infection<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Headache</p><p id="ref_1">1.
