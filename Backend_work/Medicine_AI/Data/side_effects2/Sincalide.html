Rapid IV injection of 0.04 mcg sincalide per kg would be expected to cause transient abdominal cramping.  These side effects are usually manifestations of the physiologic action of the drug, including delayed gastric emptying and increased intestinal motility.  These side effects occurred in approximately 20% of patients but they are not to be construed as necessarily indicating an abnormality of the biliary tract unless there is other clinical or radiologic evidence of disease.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>General</h3><p>Reactions to sincalide are usually mild and of short duration.  Adverse reactions including vomiting, flushing, sweating, rash, hypotension, hypertension, shortness of breath, urge to defecate, headache, diarrhea, sneezing, and numbness were less than 1%.  Dizziness was reported in approximately 2% of patients.  These manifestations are usually attenuated by a slower injection rate.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><div class="referenceList"><h4 id="refs">References</h4><p id="ref_1">1. "Product Information.
