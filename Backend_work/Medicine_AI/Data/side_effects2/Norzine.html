Extrapyramidal reactions have been reported in less than 1% of patients and included dystonia, torticollis, oculogyric crises, akathisia, and gait disturbances.  Pseudo-parkinsonian reactions including mask-like facies, drooling, cogwheel rigidity, and shuffling gait have been reported.  Convulsions have also been reported rarely.  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been reported with other phenothiazines, and the potential to occur with thiethylperazine (the active ingredient contained in Norzine) should be considered.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Gastrointestinal side effects have included dryness of the mouth and nose, sialorrhea, and altered taste sensation.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Hepatic side effects have rarely included the development of cholestatic jaundice.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p>Hematologic side effects associated with phenothiazine derivatives have rarely included leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, eosinophilia, and leukocytosis.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Cardiovascular side effects have included hypotension during intravenous administration.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Dermatologic side effects have rarely included erythema, exfoliative dermatitis, and contact dermatitis.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Ocular</h3><p>Ocular side effects have included blurred vision.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Hypersensitivity side effects including at least one case of anaphylactic reaction have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>A 15-year-old female was admitted for angioedema and respiratory distress coincident with thiethylperazine therapy.  She had been prescribed thiethylperazine (total of three doses) for abdominal pain and heavy nausea lasting for 2 days.  Three hours after the last dose, she began to complain of face and tongue edema, speech difficulties, and dysphagia.  On physical examination, she was in good general condition and showed an angioedema and erythema of the face, the upper thorax, and the tongue.  An anaphylactic reaction was suspected and treatment was initiated.  Her symptoms improved after treatment with intravenous biperiden, two aerosols of albuterol and budesonide, and intravenous methylprednisolone.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1.
