<p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Lower leg edema (up to 12.3%)</p>

<p>Pioglitazone:</p>
<p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Edema (up to 26.7%)</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Cardiac failure, chest pain<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Pioglitazone is associated with edema (peripheral, generalized, and pitting edema and fluid retention) when used alone or when used in combination therapy.  In pioglitazone monotherapy trials, edema occurred in 2.5% (n=81), 4.7% (n=275), and 6.5% (n=169) of patients receiving 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg of pioglitazone daily for 16 to 26 weeks.  Pioglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea for 16 to 24 weeks resulted in edema in 1.6% (n=184), 11.3% (n=540), and 23.1% (n=351) of patients receiving 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg of pioglitazone daily, respectively.  In a study in patients with NYHA class II or III heart failure the percentage of patients experiencing CHF progression during the study was 13.4% and 8.2% in patients receiving pioglitazone (n=262) and glyburide (n=256), respectively.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>In the PROactive trial, a study in 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease who were force-uptitrated to pioglitazone 45 mg once a day or received placebo in addition to standard of care, edema occurred in 27.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone (n=2605) compared with 15.9% of placebo (n=2633) patients.  Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to at least 1 hospitalized congestive heart failure event occurred in 5.7% of patients receiving pioglitazone and 4.1% of patients receiving placebo.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>The primary objective of the 3-year PROactive trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in high-risk patients.  No statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo/standard care were observed for time to the first occurrence of their first event (all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg).  A total of 514 patients receiving pioglitazone experienced at least 1 event compared with 572 patients receiving placebo/standard care.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been received in patients treated with pioglitazone.  Reports have been received from patients both with and without a history of a known history of heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin use.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Pioglitazone:</p>

<p>Glimepiride:</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Elevated ALT to greater than 2 x ULN</p>

In clinical trials allergic reactions such as pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions, occurred in less than 1% of patients receiving glimepiride, and some resolved despite continued treatment.</p><p>Glimepiride:</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Allergic reactions</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Serious allergic reactions</p><h3>Oncologic</h3><p>Pioglitazone:</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Bladder cancer<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>The US FDA has released results of its review of pioglitazone and bladder cancer and concluded that the data suggests use of this drug may be linked to an increase risk of bladder cancer.  A 10-year prospective cohort study in diabetic patients performed by the manufacturer (n=158,918 never users; n=34,181 ever users) identified 1075 newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer in never users and 186 cases in ever users.  The fully adjusted hazard ratio (HR) showed pioglitazone use was not associated with an increased risk (HR 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.26).  And while a modest trend towards higher risk with increasing duration was observed, this trend was not statistically significant.  Compared to the interim 5-year results, the 10-year results found weaker associations that were not statistically significant.  However, there are studies that have shown a statistically significant association between exposure to this drug and bladder cancer and an association between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure and bladder cancer.  Overall, this drug may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors, however there is insufficient data to determine whether this drug is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Endocrine</h3><p>SIADH has been reported postmarketing in patients receiving glimepiride, most often in patients who are on other medications or who have medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Pioglitazone:</p>

Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but some patients appear to have been diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination.  Some patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed.  Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of their thiazolidinedione.

The mechanism of weight gain is unclear, but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation.  In pioglitazone monotherapy trials, weight increases of 0.9 kg, 1 kg, and 2.6 kg occurred in patients receiving 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg of pioglitazone daily for 16 to 26 weeks.  Pioglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea for 16 to 24 weeks resulted in weight increases of 2 kg, 3.1 kg, and 4.1 kg, for patients receiving 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg of pioglitazone daily respectively.  In the PROactive (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events) trial, the median change in body weight in patients treated with pioglitazone (n=2560) compared with placebo (n=2581) was -0.5 kg compared to +3.6 kg.
