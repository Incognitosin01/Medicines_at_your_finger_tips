Some skin reactions can be severe and sometimes fatal.  In patients with the most severe reactions, systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, arthralgia, cholestatic jaundice, eosinophilia and mild leukocytosis, or leukopenia accompany the rash.  Among 55 patients with gout who received this drug for an average of 1 year (3 to 34 months), 3% developed pruritic maculopapular skin eruptions, sometimes scaly or exfoliative.  The incidence of skin rash appears to be greater in patients with renal insufficiency.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Angioedema has been reported with and without signs and symptoms of a more generalized hypersensitivity reaction.  Skin reactions associated with exfoliation, fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, and/or eosinophilia resembling Stevens-Johnson and/or Lyell syndromes have occurred rarely.  Associated vasculitis and tissue responses may manifest as hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, and very rarely epilepsy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DRESS also known as drug hypersensitivity syndrome has been reported.  The syndrome is potentially life-threatening and fatal.  It has been reported that symptoms may develop in approximately 1 week from initiating allopurinol (the active ingredient contained in Zyloprim) therapy, but longer latency periods have also been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Rash, maculopapular rash</p>
