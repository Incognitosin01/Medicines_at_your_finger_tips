The observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease.  Treatment with botulinum toxins may result in the formation of antibodies that may reduce the effectiveness of subsequent treatments by inactivating biological activity of the toxin.  Of the 1414 subjects treated with this drug, 2 subjects were found to have preexisting antibodies and 2 subjects had treatment-emergent antibodies.</p><p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Treatment emergent botulinum antibodies</p><h3>Ocular</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Eyelid ptosis</p><h3>Respiratory</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Upper respiratory infection</p><p id="ref_1">1.
