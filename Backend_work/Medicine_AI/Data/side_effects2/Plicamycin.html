Thrombocytopenia which is sometime rapid in onset, may occur at any time during therapy or within several days following the last dose.  Depression of platelet count, white count, hemoglobin, and prothrombin time, elevation of clotting and bleeding times, and abnormal clot retraction have been reported.  Leukopenia (6%) has been reported.  Depression in levels of serum calcium, phosphorus, and potassium have also been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>The hemorrhagic syndrome may start with an episode of hematemesis which may progress to more widespread hemorrhage in the gastrointestinal tract or to a more generalized bleeding tendency.  This may be due to abnormalities in multiple clotting factors.  The hemorrhagic syndrome has been dose related.</p><p></p><p>If severe thrombocytopenia occurs, infusion of platelet concentrates of platelet-rich plasma may of help in elevating the platelet count.</p><p></p><p>Laboratory abnormalities have generally been upon discontinuation of therapy.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Gastrointestinal effects including anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomatitis are among the most common effects reported with the use of plicamycin.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>General</h3><p>General effects including fever, weakness, lethargy, malaise, and drowsiness have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Nervous system effects including headache have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Psychiatric</h3><p>Psychiatric effects including depression have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Cardiovascular effects including phlebitis have been reported.
