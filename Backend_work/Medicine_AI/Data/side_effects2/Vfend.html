<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to voriconazole: intravenous powder for injection, oral powder for reconstitution, oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>The most frequently reported side effects in clinical trials were visual disturbances/impairment, fever/pyrexia, nausea, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, headache, increased/abnormal liver function test, peripheral edema, respiratory distress, abdominal pain, tachycardia, and hallucinations.  Side effects that most frequently led to the discontinuation of therapy included visual disturbances, rash, and elevated liver function tests.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Ocular</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Abnormal vision (up to 28.1%), visual disturbances/impairment (including blurred vision, chromatopsia, color vision change, photophobia, chloropsia, color blindness, cyanopsia, eye disorder, halo vision, night blindness, oscillopsia, photopsia, scintillating scotoma, decreased visual acuity, visual brightness, visual field defect, vitreous floaters, xanthopsia)</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Photophobia, chromatopsia, retinal hemorrhage</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Papilledema, optic nerve disorder, scleritis, blepharitis, diplopia, oculogyric crisis</p>
<p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Optic atrophy, corneal opacity</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Eye hemorrhage, abnormality of accommodation, color blindness, conjunctivitis, eye pain, dry eyes, keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis, mydriasis, night blindness, optic neuritis, retinitis, uveitis, visual field defect, alterations in color perception, decreases in electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, decreases in the visual field, transient altered perception of light, blurred vision, wavy lines on television or on going to sleep, visual disturbances (included amaurosis [partial/total blindness without visible change in the eye], asthenopia [eye strain], chromatopsia [abnormally colored vision], color blindness, diplopia, photopsia, retinal disorder, blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, visual brightness, visual impairment)</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Prolonged visual adverse events (including optic neuritis, papilledema)<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Drug-related visual disturbances were common.  In clinical trials, abnormal vision, color vision change, and/or photophobia were reported in about 21% of patients.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In clinical trials, visual impairments (including blurred vision, photophobia, chloropsia, chromatopsia, color blindness, cyanopsia, eye disorder, halo vision, night blindness, oscillopsia, photopsia, scintillating scotoma, visual acuity reduced, visual brightness, visual field defect, vitreous floaters, xanthopsia) were very common with this drug.  These visual impairments were transient and fully reversible; most spontaneously resolved within 1 hour with no clinically significant long-term visual effects.  Attenuation was observed with repeated doses.  The visual impairments were usually mild, rarely resulted in discontinuation of therapy, and were not associated with long-term sequelae.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Visual disturbances/impairments may have been related to higher plasma levels and/or doses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The mechanism of action of the visual disturbances is unknown; however, the site of action is most likely within the retina.  In a study in healthy subjects examining the effect of this drug on retinal function, this drug caused alterations in color perception, decreases in ERG waveform amplitude, and decreases in the visual field; the ERG changes did not progress over 29 days of therapy.  At 14 days after the last dose, color perception, ERG, and visual fields returned to baseline.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Elevated alkaline phosphatase (up to 22.6%), decreased potassium (up to 16.7%), fever/pyrexia, peripheral edema</p>

Increased incidence of abnormal liver function tests may have been related to higher plasma levels and/or doses.  Most abnormal liver function tests resolved during therapy without dose adjustment or resolved after dose adjustment (including therapy discontinuation).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Elevated AST (greater than 3 x ULN; up to 20.3%), total bilirubin (greater than 1.5 x ULN; up to 19.4%), and ALT (greater than 3 x ULN; up to 18.9%) have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Rash (up to 19%)</p>

<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus, ephelides, lentigo, DRESS, actinic keratosis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Most rashes were of mild to moderate severity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A photosensitivity reaction (manifested as facial edema and cheilitis) was reported in ambulatory patients (n=5) receiving 200 mg twice daily for chronic invasive Aspergillus 4 weeks after starting therapy.  Symptoms resolved shortly after stopping the drug.  Plasma and serum levels of all-trans retinol and 13-cis retinol were elevated in all the cases (n=3) measured supporting a hypothesis that this drug inhibits a step in the breakdown of all-trans retinoic acid.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A 65-year-old patient experienced pseudoporphyria after minimal sun exposure coincident with use of this drug.  After pseudoporphyria was diagnosed and because the drug could not be stopped, the patient was instructed to avoid the sun and use sunscreens with ultraviolet A and B protection.  The drug was stopped after a year of therapy, but the patient continued to be extremely photosensitive for several months.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A 45-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 3 years post allogeneic bone marrow transplant experienced blistering eruptions coincident with use of this drug.  Her posttransplant course had been complicated by chronic, grade 2, cutaneous graft versus host disease requiring therapy.  The patient had no history of bullous skin lesions.  She was started on 200 mg twice daily as prophylactic antifungal therapy.  One week later, tense blisters were observed on the hips and later on the hands.  There were prodromal burning sensations, but no associated pruritus or pain.  The lesions resolved over 5 to 7 days without scarring.  She experienced recurrent episodes involving her legs and feet.  A biopsy obtained from the knee showed moderate hyperkeratosis, striking atrophy, and extensive basal vacuolization and colloid body formation.  The temporal association of the start of this drug and onset of the eruption raised suspicion that it was the etiologic factor; thus, the drug was discontinued.  The blistering resolved within 2 weeks with no further episodes.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Headache</p>

After pseudoporphyria was diagnosed and because the drug could not be stopped, the patient was instructed to avoid the sun and use sunscreens with ultraviolet A and B protection.

Her posttransplant course had been complicated by chronic, grade 2, cutaneous graft versus host disease requiring therapy.  The patient had no history of bullous skin lesions.  She was started on 200 mg twice daily as prophylactic antifungal therapy.  One week later, tense blisters were observed on the hips and later on the hands.  There were prodromal burning sensations, but no associated pruritus or pain.  The lesions resolved over 5 to 7 days without scarring.  She experienced recurrent episodes involving her legs and feet.  A biopsy obtained from the knee showed moderate hyperkeratosis, striking atrophy, and extensive basal vacuolization and colloid body formation.  The temporal association of the start of this drug and onset of the eruption raised suspicion that it was the etiologic factor; thus, the drug was discontinued.  The blistering resolved within 2 weeks with no further episodes.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Headache</p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Dizziness,
