<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to cobicistat: oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>In a clinical trial, safety of this drug was evaluated in therapy-naive patients using cobicistat-boosted atazanavir with emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF).  The most common side effects were jaundice and rash; side effects associated with elevated bilirubin levels were frequently reported.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The manufacturer product information for atazanavir or darunavir should be consulted.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>In 1 clinical trial, hyperbilirubinemia (greater than 1 times the upper limit of normal [1 x ULN]) was reported in 97.7% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted atazanavir group and 97.4% in the ritonavir-boosted atazanavir group through 144 weeks of therapy.  Increases in total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN was reported in 88% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group and 80.9% in the ritonavir-boosted group.  Increases in total bilirubin greater than 2.5 x ULN was reported in 73% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group and 66% in the ritonavir-boosted group.  Increased ALT or AST (greater than 3 x ULN) was reported in 12.8% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group and 9% in the ritonavir-boosted group.  Increased ALT (greater than 5 x ULN), AST (greater than 5 x ULN), and GGT (greater than 5 x ULN) were reported in 6%, 4%, and 4% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group, respectively.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Hyperbilirubinemia, increased total bilirubin, jaundice, increased ALT or AST</p>

<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, flatulence, dry mouth, increased lipase, increased serum amylase</p>

The mean change in eGFR (by Cockcroft-Gault method) after 144 weeks of therapy was -15.1 mL/min in the cobicistat-boosted group.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In HIV-1-infected therapy-experienced patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction (eGFR [by Cockcroft-Gault method) 50 to 89 mL/min) who switched pharmacokinetic enhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat, the mean change in serum creatinine was 0.07 mg/dL and the mean change in eGFR (by Cockcroft-Gault method) was -6.2 mL/min at week 96.</p>

<p>Renal impairment (including acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome) has been reported when this drug was used in regimen containing tenofovir DF.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><div class="referenceList"><h4 id="refs">References</h4><p id="ref_1">1.
