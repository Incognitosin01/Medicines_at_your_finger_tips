Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals who received the combination of stavudine and didanosine with other antiretroviral agents. Coadministration of stavudine and didanosine is contraindicated because of increased risk of serious and/or life-threatening events. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur. Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis have occurred during therapy when stavudine was part of a combination regimen that included didanosine.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, stavudine (the active ingredient contained in Zerit XR) may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>
