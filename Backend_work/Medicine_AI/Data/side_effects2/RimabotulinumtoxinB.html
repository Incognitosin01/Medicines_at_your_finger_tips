<li>FAQ</li></ul><h2>In Summary</h2><p><b>Commonly reported side effects of rimabotulinumtoxinB include:</b> dysphagia, dyspepsia, nausea, pain, and xerostomia. <b>Other side effects include:</b> asthenia, myasthenia, back pain, increased cough, and influenza.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to rimabotulinumtoxinB: intramuscular solution</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Intramuscular route (Injectable)</p><p>Postmarketing reports indicate that the effects of rimabotulinumtoxinB and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. These may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses, including spasticity in children and adults, and in approved indications, cases of spread of effect have occurred at doses comparable to those used to treat cervical dystonia and at lower doses.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, rimabotulinumtoxinB may cause some unwanted effects.
