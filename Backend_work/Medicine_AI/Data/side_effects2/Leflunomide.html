 <h1>Leflunomide Side Effects</h1><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Consumer</li>
<li>Professional</li>
<li>FAQ</li></ul><h2>In Summary</h2><p><b>Commonly reported side effects of leflunomide include:</b> alopecia, diarrhea, increased serum alanine aminotransferase, increased serum aspartate aminotransferase, and skin rash. <b>Other side effects include:</b> bronchitis, hypersensitivity condition, hypertension, pruritus, rhinitis, and tenosynovitis.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to leflunomide: oral tablet</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet)</p><p>Leflunomide is contraindicated in pregnant women due to potential for fetal harm. Pregnancy must be excluded before the start of treatment and must be avoided during treatment or prior to the completion of the accelerated drug elimination procedure after treatment with leflunomide. Severe liver injury, including fatal liver failure, has been reported in patients treated with leflunomide. Do not use in patients with acute or chronic liver disease or an ALT greater than 2 times the ULN, and ALT monitoring is recommended after starting leflunomide. Stop leflunomide and use an accelerated drug elimination procedure if pregnancy occurs or leflunomide-induced liver injury is suspected.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, leflunomide may cause some unwanted effects.

The patient had been taking leflunomide 20 mg per day and prednisone 5 mg per day.  She presented with complaints of a one day history of abdominal pain.  A CT scan showed a parastomal collection and stomach perforation.  She proceeded to surgery for drainage of the collection and repair of the perforation.  The leflunomide therapy was subsequently stopped and cholestyramine washout administered.

She developed the adverse event 2 weeks after cessation of 6-weeks treatment with leflunomide.  She was diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia, probably induced by leflunomide because acute respiratory failure was preceded by hypertension and elevated serum liver enzyme concentration.  She showed dramatic improvement with cholestyramine and prednisolone.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Hypertension, chest pain</p>

<p>A 61-year-old female with severe rheumatoid arthritis experienced cellulitis coincident with leflunomide therapy.  The patient had been taking leflunomide 20 mg alternate days and prednisone 10 mg per day.  She presented with cellulitis of the left foot that had not responded to oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.  Isolates from a plantar ulcer showed Staphylococcus aureus.  Despite appropriate antibiotic treatment, the infection progressed rapidly and she developed necrosis of the left foot.  She proceeded to surgical debridement with forefoot amputation and skin graft.  On day 4 of admission, leflunomide therapy was discontinued and cholestyramine washout administered.  She had a prolonged hospital stay that required 5 further debridement procedures.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Alopecia (up to 17%), rash (up to 12%)</p>

The patient had been taking leflunomide 20 mg daily as monotherapy for 31 months.  He presented with a 2 month history of anorexia, 10 kg weight loss, fever, and night sweats.  A CT scan showed multiple low attenuation lesions in the liver.  Initial liver biopsy was nondiagnostic, revealing only minor changes with no evidence of infection.  Although Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture was negative, due to strong clinical suspicion, he was given empiric antituberculosis therapy.  The patient's condition improved dramatically over subsequent weeks.  At 18 months review, he remained well taking prednisone monotherapy.  Although culture negative, a diagnosis of probable mycobacterium infection was made on the basis of typical histological findings on liver biopsy, exclusion of other pathology and prompt response to antituberculosis treatment.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Abnormal liver enzymes</p>
