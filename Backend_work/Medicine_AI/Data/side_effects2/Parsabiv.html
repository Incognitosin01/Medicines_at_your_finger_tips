<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Anaphylactic reaction</p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Headache, paresthesia </p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Seizures secondary to hypocalcemia</p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): QTcF interval increase, heart failure hospitalization </p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Hypotension, congestive heart failure, decreased myocardial performance</p><p>During clinical trials, 1.2% of patients receiving this drug experienced a QTcF interval increase greater than 60 msec compared to 0% of placebo patients.  The incidence of maximum post-baseline predialysis QTcF greater than 500 msec was 4.8% and 1.9% in those receiving this drug and placebo, respectively.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>During clinical trials, heart failure requiring hospitalization occurred in 2% of patients receiving this drug compared with 1% of placebo patients.  Reductions in corrected serum calcium may be associated with congestive heart failure, however, a causal relationship to this drug could not be completely excluded.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Diarrhea (11%), nausea (11%)</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Vomiting </p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Upper gastrointestinal bleeding</p><h3>Musculoskeletal</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Muscle spasms (12%) </p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Myalgia</p><h3>Immunologic</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Anti-drug binding antibody formation</p><p>During clinical studies 7.1% (71/995) patients treated fro up to 6 months tested positive for binding anti-etelcalcetide antibodies.  No evidence of altered pharmacokinetic profile, clinical response, or safety profile was associated with the development of these antibodies.  If formation of anti-etelcalcetide biding antibodies is associated with a clinically significant event, Amgen can be contacted at 1-800-77-AMGEN (1-800-772-6436) to discuss antibody testing.</p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Blood calcium decreased (64%); hypophosphatemia (18%) </p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia </p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Hypocalcemia with concomitantly administered products known to lower serum calcium (e.g.  cinacalcet, denosumab)</p><p>Blood calcium decreases include asymptomatic reductions in calcium below 7.5 mg/dL or clinically significant asymptomatic reductions in corrected serum calcium between 7.5 and less than 8.3 mg/dL that required medical management.  Hypocalcemia includes symptomatic reductions in corrected serum calcium to less than 8.3 mg/dL.  During clinical studies, at least 1 corrected serum calcium value below 7.0 mg/dL (7.6% vs 3.1%) below 7.5 mg/dL (27% vs 5.5%), and below 8.3 mg/dL (79% vs 19%) occurred; 1% of patients receiving this drug discontinued treatment due low corrected serum calcium (placebo=0).  </p>
