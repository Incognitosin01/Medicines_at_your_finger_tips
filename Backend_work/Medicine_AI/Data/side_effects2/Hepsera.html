Some of the dosage forms listed on this page <em>may not</em> apply to the brand name Hepsera.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to adefovir: oral tablet</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet)</p><p>Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis may occur in patients who discontinue adefovir dipivoxil. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients. Chronic use of adefovir dipivoxil may result in nephrotoxicity in patients at risk of or having underlying renal dysfunction; therefore, monitor renal function closely in these patients. Dose adjustment may be required. Emergence of HIV resistance may occur in chronic hepatitis B patients with unrecognized or untreated HIV infection who are treated with adefovir dipivoxil. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, adefovir (the active ingredient contained in Hepsera) may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>
