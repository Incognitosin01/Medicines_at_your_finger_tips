<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to iohexol: injectable solution, oral solution</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions are headache, mild to moderate pain including backache, neckache and stiffness, nausea, and vomiting.  These reactions usually occur 1 to 10 hours after injection, and almost all occur within 24 hours.  They are usually mild to moderate in degree, lasting for a few hours, and usually disappearing within 24 hours.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Diarrhea (oral/body cavity routes)</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography), lower abdominal pain (hysterosalpingography)</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Abdominal pain, stomach ache</p>
<p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Diarrhea</p>
<p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Tenderness and/or enlargement of the salivary glands ("iodide mumps"), abdominal discomfort</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Aggravation of pancreatitis, acute pancreatitis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Rarely, headaches may be severe or persist for days.  Headache is often accompanied by nausea and vomiting and tends to be more frequent and persistent in patients not optimally hydrated.</p>
<p>Aseptic meningitis syndrome was usually preceded by pronounced headaches, nausea and vomiting.  Onset usually occurred about 12 to 18 hours postprocedure.  Prominent features were meningismus, fever, sometimes with oculomotor signs and mental confusion.  Lumbar puncture revealed a high white cell count, high protein content often with a low glucose level and with absence of organisms.  The condition usually started to clear spontaneously about 10 hours after onset, with complete recovery over 2 to 3 days.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Headache (may be severe and prolonged)</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Dizziness (2%), neuralgia</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Aseptic meningitis syndrome (including chemical meningitis), visual hallucinations, somnolence, hemiparesis, transient ischemic attack, cerebral infarction, syncope</p>
<p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Seizure, neurological changes, drowsiness, transitory peripheral neuropathies (sensory and/or motor or nerve root disturbances, myelitis, persistent leg muscle pain or weakness, 6th nerve palsy, or cauda equina syndrome)</p>
<p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Dysgeusia (transient metallic taste), disturbance in consciousness, transient contrast-induced encephalopathy (including transient memory loss, coma, stupor, retrograde amnesia), sensory abnormalities (including hypoesthesia), paraesthesia, tremor</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Syncope vasovagal, motor dysfunction (including speech disorder, aphasia, dysarthria), disorientation, abnormal electroencephalogram, meningism<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Pain</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Feeling hot</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Discomfort, fever, hives</p>

<p><b>Rare</b> (less than 0.1%): Loss of appetite</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Iodism<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Musculoskeletal</h3><p>Severe pain may often result from undue use of pressure or the injection of large volumes.
