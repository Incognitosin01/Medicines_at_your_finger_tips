<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Weight gain<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>The ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention) trial, an open-labeled, randomized study comparing insulin glargine to standard care in persons 50 years or older with abnormal glucose levels (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance) or early type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular (CV) disease or CV risk factors, found over the course of the 6 year study, severe hypoglycemia occurred in 5.7% of patients receiving insulin glargine compared to 1.9% in the standard care group.  The median HbA1c values in the insulin glargine group ranged from 5.9% to 6.4% while the HbA1c values in the standard care group ranged from 6.2% to 6.6%.  The incidence for all hypoglycemia was 58% and 26% in the insulin glargine and standard groups, respectively.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Weight gain has been reported with insulin therapy and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria.  In the ORIGIN trial, the median change in body weight from baseline to the last treatment visit was 2.2 kg greater in the insulin glargine group (+1.4 kg vs -0.8 kg).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Local</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Injection site reactions, injection site pain</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Injection site reactions include redness, pain, itching, hives, swelling, or inflammation.  In some cases, these reactions may be caused by other factors, such as irritants in skin cleansing agents.  In clinical studies, there was a higher incidence of treatment-emergent injection site pain in insulin-glargine treated patients compared to NPH-treated patients (2.7% vs 0.7%).  Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred and hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis.  Hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p><b>Rare</b> (less than 0.1%): Allergic reactions<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Hypersensitivity side effects have included both local and systemic reactions.  Anaphylaxis has been reported.  Local reactions have presented as erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the injection site.  Most minor reactions to insulin at the injection site resolve in a few days to a few weeks.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Medication errors</p><p>Medication errors, in which other insulins, particularly rapid-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of this insulin, have been reported.</p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Insulin may cause sodium retention and edema, especially as metabolic control is improving.

In July 2009, The US FDA reported on an ongoing safety review evaluating a possible increased risk of cancer.  In February 2011, the FDA in an updated communication reported the evidence was inconclusive and it is not possible to conclude that the use of this insulin increases the risk of cancer.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Immunologic</h3><p>As with all therapeutic proteins, the potential for immunogenicity exits.  The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by assay methodology, sample handling and collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease.
