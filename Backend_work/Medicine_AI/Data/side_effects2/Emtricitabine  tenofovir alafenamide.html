Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in individuals who are infected with HBV and discontinue emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide. If appropriate, initiation of antihepatitis B therapy may be warranted. Emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide used for HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis must only be prescribed to individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative immediately prior to initiating and at least every 3 months during use. Drug-resistant HIV-1 variants have been identified with use of FTC during use. Drug-resistant HIV-1 variants have been identified with use of FTC/TDF for HIV-1 PrEP following undetected acute HIV-1 infection. Do not initiate emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide for HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis if signs or symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection are present unless negative infection status is confirmed.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide may cause some unwanted effects.
