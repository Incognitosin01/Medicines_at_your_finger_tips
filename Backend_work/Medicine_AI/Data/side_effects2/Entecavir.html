Hepatic function should be monitored closely for at least several months after discontinuation. Initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. Entecavir is not recommended in patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) who are not also receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) because of the potential for the development of resistance to HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogue inhibitors.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, entecavir may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>
<b>Check with your doctor immediately</b> if any of the following side effects occur while taking entecavir:</p><p>

One percent of patients discontinued therapy due to side effects or laboratory abnormalities (compared to 4% of lamivudine-treated patients).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The most common side effects reported in patients with chronic HBV infection and evidence of hepatic decompensation (n=102) through Week 48 of a study have included peripheral edema, ascites, pyrexia, hepatic encephalopathy, and upper respiratory infection.  The cumulative death rate was 23% with entecavir during the first 48 weeks of therapy (compared to 33% with adefovir).  The majority of deaths were due to liver-related causes such as hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.  Through Week 48, up to 7% of patients discontinued this drug due to a side effect.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Elevated ALT (greater than 10 times ULN and greater than 2 times baseline: up to 2%; greater than 5 times ULN: up to 12%; greater than 3 times baseline: up to 5%; greater than 2 times baseline [with total bilirubin greater than 2 times ULN and greater than 2 times baseline]: up to 1%) and total bilirubin (greater than 2.5 times ULN; up to 3%) have been reported.</p>

<p>Posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis or ALT flare, as defined by ALT greater than 10 times ULN and greater than 2 times baseline, have been reported in patients who discontinued therapy at or after 52 weeks after achieving a defined treatment response (nucleoside-naive hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]-positive: 2%; nucleoside-naive HBeAg-negative: 8%; lamivudine-refractory: 12%).  The median time to exacerbation was 23 to 24 weeks.  The rate may be higher in patients who discontinue this drug without regard to treatment response.</p>
