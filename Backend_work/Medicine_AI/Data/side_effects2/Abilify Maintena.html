Aripiprazole is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies. These studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant use in patients over age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressant use in patients aged 65 and older.In patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy, monitor closely for worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Advise families and caregivers of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber.The safety and efficacy of aripiprazole have not been established in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, aripiprazole (the active ingredient contained in Abilify Maintena) may cause some unwanted effects.

The incidence of these effects may be dose related.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a dose response analysis, somnolence including sedation was the only adverse reaction determined to have a dose response relationship in adult patients.  Somnolence was reported in 12.6% of adult patients with schizophrenia receiving the 30 mg dose.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age, extrapyramidal disorder, somnolence, and tremor displayed possible dose response relationship in patients with schizophrenia, while extrapyramidal disorder, somnolence, and akathisia displayed possible dose response relationship in pediatric patients with bipolar mania.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Extrapyramidal symptoms were more prevalent with use of the extended-release IM injection compared with oral formulations (18.4% versus 11.7%).  Extrapyramidal disorder occurred most frequently with 30 mg oral doses, while the disorder occurred in 9.1% of patients given 10 mg oral doses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Akathisia was the most frequently observed adverse event with the extended-release IM injection; it typically starts around day 10 and lasts a median of 56 days.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>Reports of diabetes mellitus included increases in blood insulin, decreases in carbohydrate tolerance, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, and glycosuria.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Analysis of 13 placebo-controlled monotherapy trials in adult patients primarily with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder revealed a mean increase in fasting blood glucose of 4.4 mg/dL with a median exposure of 25 days.  This was not significantly different from placebo (+2.5 mg/dL, median exposure 22 days).  A pooled analysis in pediatric patients revealed a mean change in fasting glucose of 2.4 mg/dL compared with 0.1 mg/dL in placebo treated patients following 12 weeks of therapy.  In long-term, open label schizophrenia studies with aripiprazole (the active ingredient contained in Abilify Maintena) lauroxil, 14% of patients with HbA1c less than 5.7% at baseline developed levels of 5.7% or higher post-baseline.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients receiving atypical antipsychotics.  Analyses of patients receiving this drug are limited due to the small number of patients who received this drug for extended periods in the clinical trials.  In long-term, open label schizophrenia studies with aripiprazole lauroxil, shifts in fasting total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides from normal to high were reported in 1%, 1%, and 8% of patients.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Weight gain has been observed in patients receiving atypical antipsychotics.  Analysis of 13 placebo-controlled monotherapy trials in adult patients primarily with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder revealed a mean change in weight of +0.3 kg (n=1673) with a median exposure of 21 to 25 days compared with a decrease of 0.1 kg in placebo treated patients (n=1100).  A pooled analysis in pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) revealed a mean change in weight of +5.8 kg (n=62) compared with +1.4 kg (n=13) in placebo treated patients following 12 weeks of therapy.  In a 12-week, fixed dose schizophrenia study in patients receiving with aripiprazole lauroxil, IM weight gain of 7% or greater from baseline was observed in 10% (n=207) and 9% (n=208) of patients receiving 441 mg and 882 mg IM, respectively.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>During clinical trials, the percentage of pediatric and adolescent patients by indication with weight gain of 7% or more of body weight compared to placebo was (5.2% vs 1.6%), (26.3% vs 7.1%), and (20% vs 7.6%), respectively for schizophrenia/bipolar mania, irritability associated with autistic disorder, and Tourette's disorder, respectively.  Treatment durations were 4 to 6 weeks, 8 weeks, and 8 to 10 weeks, respectively.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Aripiprazole lauroxil Extended-Release IM Suspension:</p>

The average length of duration for the trials was 10 weeks with the cause of death in the majority of cases, though not all, reported as either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature.
