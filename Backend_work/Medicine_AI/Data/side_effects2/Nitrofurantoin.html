<p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Peripheral neuropathy including optic neuritis (sensory and motor involvement), nystagmus, vertigo, dizziness, drowsiness</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), bulging fontanels, polyneuropathy (including optic neuritis), sensory loss, paresthesia, motor loss, neuropathy (generally beginning as paresthesia of the lower extremities and the hands and progressing to muscle weakness and wasting), cerebellar dysfunction</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Optic neuritis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Peripheral neuropathy (which was sometimes severe or irreversible) has occurred; fatalities have been reported.

<p></p>
<p>Polyneuropathy, which started peripherally with initial sensory loss and paresthesia but progressed to motor loss (often with severe muscle atrophy), has occurred during therapy.  A predisposing condition in most of these patients was renal failure, which was often accompanied by anemia, diabetes, electrolyte imbalance, vitamin B deficiency, and debilitating disease.  After stopping this drug, further deterioration generally halted and total or partial regression occurred in almost 80% of affected patients.

<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Fever, chills, malaise, asthenia, drug fever, superinfections due to resistant organisms (e.g., Pseudomonas species, Candida species), C difficile superinfections, increased alkaline phosphatase, increased lactate dehydrogenase<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Respiratory</h3><p>Chronic pulmonary reactions occurred rarely, generally in patients who received continuous therapy for at least 6 months; such reactions were more common in elderly patients.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Acute pulmonary reactions generally occurred within the first week of therapy and were reversible when therapy was stopped; resolution was often dramatic.  Acute pulmonary reactions were commonly manifested by fever, chills, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltration with consolidation/pleural effusion on chest x-ray, and eosinophilia.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In subacute pulmonary reactions, fever and eosinophilia occurred less often than in the acute form.  After therapy was stopped, recovery sometimes required several months.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Chronic pulmonary reactions (symptoms included malaise, exertional dyspnea, cough, altered pulmonary function, radiologic/histologic findings of diffuse interstitial pneumonitis and/or fibrosis)</p>
