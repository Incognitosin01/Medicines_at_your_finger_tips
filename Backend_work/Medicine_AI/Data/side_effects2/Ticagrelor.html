<li>FAQ</li></ul><h2>In Summary</h2><p><b>Commonly reported side effects of ticagrelor include:</b> dyspnea.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to ticagrelor: oral tablet</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet)</p><p>Ticagrelor, can cause significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding. Do not use in patients with active pathological bleeding or history of intracranial hemorrhage. Do not start in patients undergoing urgent CABG. If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing ticagrelor. Stopping ticagrelor increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. Maintenance doses of aspirin above 100 mg reduce the effectiveness of ticagrelor and should be avoided.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, ticagrelor may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>

<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to ticagrelor: oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>The most commonly reported side effects were bleeding and dyspnea.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Bleeding (12%)<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>In the PLATO study (PLATelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes, n= 18,624), 9235 patients were treated with ticagrelor 90 mg orally twice a day.  Patients were evaluated for non-CABG related major or minor bleeds compared to clopidogrel (n=9186).  A minor bleed required medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding, whereas a major bleed included any of the following: fatal, intracranial, intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade, hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention, significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss), a decrease in hemoglobin of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit of at least 9%), or a transfusion of 2 or more units.  A major bleed that was fatal/life-threatening was any of the events described as a major bleed plus a decrease in hemoglobin of more than 5 g/dL, a fall in hematocrit of at least 15%, or a transfusion of 4 or more units.  A fatal bleed was a bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days.  For ticagrelor, the incidence of major and minor bleeds was 7.7% (clopidogrel 6.2%).  These findings are broken down as followed: Major bleed (3.9%) major bleed fatal/life threatening (1.9%), fatal (0.2%), and intracranial hemorrhage fatal/life threatening (0.3%).  Approximately half of the non-CABG major bleeding events occurred in the first 30 days.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>In the PLATO study, when antiplatelet therapy was stopped 5 days prior to CABG, major bleeding occurred in 75% and 79% of patients receiving ticagrelor or clopidogrel, respectively.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Respiratory</h3><p>During the PLATO study, (PLATelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes, n= 18,624), dyspnea was reported in 13.8% of ticagrelor-treated patients, it was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment, however, drug discontinuation was required in 0.9% of patients.  In the PEGASUS study (n=21,162), 4.3% of patients taking ticagrelor 60 mg orally twice a day discontinued treatment due to dyspnea compared to 0.7% receiving aspirin alone.  In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea.  There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment.  During the THEMIS study (n=19,220), dyspnea was reported in 21% of ticagrelor-treated patients which led to drug discontinuation in 6.9% of patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Dyspnea (up to 21%)</p>

Patients that were at an increased risk for bradycardic events were excluded from these studies.  Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) who were taking ticagrelor experienced ventricular pauses at a higher rate (9.2%) than those without CHF (5.4).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Ventricular pauses, cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, bradycardia, cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral edema, hypertension, hypotension, syncope, pre-syncope</p>

Levels did not continue to increase with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy.  Reversibility occurred upon discontinuation even in those patients with the greatest increase in levels during treatment.
