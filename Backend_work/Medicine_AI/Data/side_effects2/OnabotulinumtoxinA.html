<li>FAQ</li></ul><h2>In Summary</h2><p><b>Commonly reported side effects of onabotulinumtoxinA include:</b> antibody development.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to onabotulinumtoxinA: powder for solution</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Injection route (Powder for Solution)</p><p>Distant spread of toxin effects - The effects of onabotulinumtoxinA and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults, particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, onabotulinumtoxinA may cause some unwanted effects.

Local weakness of the injected muscle(s) represents the expected pharmacological action while weakness of nearby muscle may also occur due to spread of toxin.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Deaths as a complication of severe dysphagia have been reported with botulinum toxin.  In cervical dystonia patients, dysphagia was reported in 19% of patients.  Most dysphagia was reported as mild or moderate, however, dyspnea accompanied dysphagia in about 20% of these cases.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Dysphagia (up to 19%) </p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Constipation, nausea</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Oral dryness</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Swallowing difficulties, jaw pain</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, vomiting, anorexia<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Respiratory</h3><p>Patients in the upper limb spasticity trials who had stable, reduced respiratory function at baseline experienced a greater event rate change in forced vital capacity (15% or greater or 20% or greater decline) compared with placebo at weeks 1, 6, and 12.  These differences from placebo were not statistically significant, but noticeable.  Among patients with restrictive lung disease of neuromuscular aetiology and detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition, the event rate of decreased forced vital capacity (FVC) of 15% or 20% or more was also greater in treated patients compared with placebo.  Bronchitis has been reported more frequently in patients treated for upper limb spasticity (3% vs 1%) compared with placebo.  In patients with reduced lung function treated for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently in treated patients compared with placebo (up to 11% vs 6%).  In patients treated for lower limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently compared with placebo (2% vs 1%).  In pediatric patients treated for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently compared with placebo (17% [6 units/kg]; 10% [3 Units/kg]; 9% [placebo]).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Very Common (10% or more): Upper respiratory tract infection</p>

<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Dysuria, hematuria, bacteriuria, residual urine volume</p><p>In trials in patients with overactive bladder (OAB), the more commonly reported adverse reactions within the first 12 weeks after intradetrusor injection were urinary tract infection (UTI; 18%), dysuria (9%), urinary retention (6%), bacteriuria (4%) and residual urine volume (3%).  A higher incidence of UTI was observed in patients with diabetes than those without (31% vs 26%).  The incidence of UTI increased in patients who experienced a maximum post-void residual (PVR) urine volume over 200 mL following injection compared to those whose PVR urine volume was 200 mL or less (44% vs 23%).  </p>
