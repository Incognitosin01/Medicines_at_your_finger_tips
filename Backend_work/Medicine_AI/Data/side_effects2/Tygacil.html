<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to tigecycline: intravenous powder for injection</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>In clinical trials, 2514 patients were treated with this drug.  In comparative trials, serious side effects related to infection were reported more often in patients treated with this drug (7%) versus comparators (6%), with sepsis/septic shock reported in 2% and 1% of patients treated with this drug and comparator drugs, respectively.  The most common side effects were nausea and vomiting which usually occurred within the first 2 days of therapy and were of mild or moderate severity.  This drug was discontinued due to side effects in 7% of patients (compared to 6% for all comparators).  Discontinuation was most often due to nausea (1%) and vomiting (1%) inpatients treated with this drug and nausea (less than 1%) in comparator-treated patients.</p>

<p>In all 13 phase 3 and 4 trials that included a comparator, death occurred in 4% and 3% of patients receiving this drug and comparator drugs, respectively.
