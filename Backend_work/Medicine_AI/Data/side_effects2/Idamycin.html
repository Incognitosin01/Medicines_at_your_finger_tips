<li>Professional</li></ul><p class="ddc-notification"><b>Note:</b> This document contains side effect information about idarubicin. Some of the dosage forms listed on this page <em>may not</em> apply to the brand name Idamycin.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to idarubicin: intravenous solution</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Intravenous route (Solution)</p><p>Administer slowly into a freely flowing intravenous infusion. If extravasation occurs during administration, severe local tissue necrosis will occur; never administer via IM or subQ routes. Administer only under the supervision of a physician who is experienced in leukemia chemotherapy and in facilities that can monitor for drug tolerance and toxicity. The physician and institution must be able to respond to severe hemorrhagic conditions or overwhelming infection. Like other anthracyclines, idarubicin hydrochloride injection can cause myocardial toxicity leading to congestive heart failure. Cardiac toxicity is more common in patients who have received prior anthracyclines or who have preexisting cardiac disease. Severe myelosuppression will occur with idarubicin hydrochloride when used at therapeutic doses and dose reductions are required for patients with impaired hepatic or renal function</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, idarubicin (the active ingredient contained in Idamycin) may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>
