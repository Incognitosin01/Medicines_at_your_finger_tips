Increased risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein thrombosis in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) have been reported. An increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older has also been reported. Estrogens with progestins reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding should have adequate diagnostic tests, including directed or random endometrial sampling, to rule out malignancy.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, estradiol / levonorgestrel may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>

The relative risk (RR) of invasive breast cancer was reported at 1.24 (absolute risk 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years) compared with placebo.  For women with a prior history of hormone therapy, RR was 1.86 (absolute risk 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years) compared with placebo.

<p>Endometrial Cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in woman with a uterus; risk is about 2 to 12 times greater without progestin.  Most studies show the greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use.  Risk has been shown to persist for 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.  Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer</p>
<p>A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women using hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer.  Relative risks associated with current use was calculated at 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 1.50).  The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years) were comparable and elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products.  It is not possible to determine the exact duration of hormone use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Migraine</p>
