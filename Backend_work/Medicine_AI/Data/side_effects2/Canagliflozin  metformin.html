 <h1>Canagliflozin / metformin Side Effects</h1><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Consumer</li>
<li>Professional</li></ul><h2>In Summary</h2><p><b>Commonly reported side effects of canagliflozin/metformin include:</b> lactic acidosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, vaginal infection, vulvitis, and vulvovaginitis. <b>Other side effects include:</b> cyanocobalamin deficiency, balanitis, balanoposthitis, increased urine output, nocturia, polyuria, urinary urgency, and pollakiuria.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to canagliflozin/metformin: oral tablet, oral tablet extended release</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet; Tablet, Extended Release)</p><p>Lactic Acidosis:Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (greater than 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL.Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (eg, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (eg, acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the full prescribing information.If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue canagliflozin / metformin hydrochloride and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, canagliflozin / metformin may cause some unwanted effects.

<p>Metformin: </p>
<p>- The most commonly reported adverse reactions included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Musculoskeletal</h3><p>In the CANVAS trial, amputations per 1000 patients per year in patients receiving canagliflozin (100 mg or 300 mg per day) were 5.8 compared to 2.8 amputations per 1000 patients per year in the placebo group.  In the CANVAS-R trials, these numbers were 7.5 and 4.2, respectively.  The total number of amputations among canagliflozin-treated patients (n=5790) was 221 compared with 69 in the placebo group (n=4344).  Amputations of the toe and midfoot were the most frequent; however, amputations involving the leg, below and above the knee, also occurred.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>On September 10, 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a drug safety communication regarding new information on bone fracture risk and decreased bone mineral density with use of canagliflozin.  Based on updated data, fractures have occurred as early as 12 weeks after starting therapy with trauma that is usually minor, such as falling from standing height.  Additionally, a 2-year study (n=714) has shown a greater loss of bone mineral density at the hip and lower spine in canagliflozin treated patients compared with placebo.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Canagliflozin:</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Lower limb amputations</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Bone fracture, upper extremity fracture, loss of bone mineral density at hip and lower spine<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Genitourinary</h3><p>Canagliflozin:</p>
<p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Female genital mycotic infections (up to 11.4%)</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Urinary tract infections, increased urination, male genital mycotic infections, vulvovaginal pruritus</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Fournier's gangrene<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>In the 5 years (2013 to 2018) since SGLT2 inhibitor approval, 12 cases of Fournier's gangrene have been reported.  Reports were almost equal in men and women (men=7; women=5), ages ranged from 38 to 78 years, and the average time to onset after starting an SGLT2 inhibitor was 9.2 months (range 7 days to 25 months).  All SGLT2 inhibitor drugs except ertugliflozin were included in the reports.  Ertugliflozin being the most recently approved agent, is expected to have the same risk, but insufficient patient use to assess risk.  All patients were hospitalized, all required surgery, all required surgical debridement, 5 required more than 1 surgery and 1 required skin grafting.  Four cases were complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, and septic shock, leading to prolonged hospitalization, and death in 1 case.  In the general population, Fournier's gangrene occurs in about 1.6 out of 100,000 males annually, with the highest incidence in men 50 to 79 years.  Since diabetes is a risk factor for Fournier's gangrene, a review of the FAERS database for the last 34 years was done and only 6 cases (all males, median age 57 years) were found with several other classes of antidiabetic drugs.  Findings with SGLT2 inhibitors appear to show an association over a shorter time frame and involve both males and females.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Canagliflozin:</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Volume depletion-related reactions<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Volume depletion-related reactions included hypotension, postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and dehydration.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>Canagliflozin:</p>

<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, increased non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis, ketoacidosis, or ketosis	</p>
<p></p>
<p>Metformin:</p>
<p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Lactic acidosis, vitamin B12 deficiency<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Twenty reports of acidosis have been identified in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database during the period March 2013 through 06 June 2014.  All patients required emergency room treatment or hospitalization.  These cases were not typical of ketoacidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in that they occurred in patients with type 2 diabetes and their blood sugar levels were only slightly increased.  Some factors identified as potentially triggering the acidosis included major illness, reduced food and fluid intake, and reduced insulin dose.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p>Canagliflozin:</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Renal function decline</p>

<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Increased hemoglobin<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p>Final results from 2 clinical trials, the CANVAS (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) and the CANVAS-R (A Study of the Effects of Canagliflozin on Renal Endpoints in Adult Participants with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) have shown leg and foot amputations occurred almost twice as often in canagliflozin treated patients compared with placebo treated patients.  Amputations of the toe and middle of the foot were most common, however some amputations involved the leg, below and above the knee.  Some patients had more than 1 amputation; some involved both limbs.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>The risk of amputation calculated from the CANVAS trial showed 5.9 per 1000 patients per year for canagliflozin treated patients compared to 2.8 per 1000 patients per year for placebo patients.  The CANVAS-R trial showed 7.5 per 1000 patients per year compared to 4.2 per 1000 patients per year for canagliflozin treated patients and placebo patients, respectively.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Canagliflozin:</p>
