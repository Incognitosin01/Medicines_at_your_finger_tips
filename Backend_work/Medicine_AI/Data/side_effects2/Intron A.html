<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to interferon alfa-2b: injectable kit, injectable powder for injection, injectable solution</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>Clinical trials were conducted for various indications using a wide range of doses (from 6 million international units/m2/week in hairy cell leukemia up to 100 million international units/m2/week in melanoma).  Most side effects reported during clinical trials were mild to moderate in severity and manageable.  Some side effects were transient and most diminished with continued therapy.  Influenza-like symptoms (mainly fever, headache, rigors/chills, myalgia, malaise, and fatigue) were reported most often; these side effects were reversible within 72 hours after interrupting or stopping therapy.  Side effects were dose-related.  In general, more severe toxicities were observed at higher doses; hematologic, hepatic, cardiovascular, and neurologic toxicities were more common with higher doses.</p>

Most side effects reported during clinical trials were mild to moderate in severity and manageable.  Some side effects were transient and most diminished with continued therapy.  Influenza-like symptoms (mainly fever, headache, rigors/chills, myalgia, malaise, and fatigue) were reported most often; these side effects were reversible within 72 hours after interrupting or stopping therapy.  Side effects were dose-related.
