</ul><p><i>Applies to inamrinone: intravenous solution</i></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p>Thrombocytopenia may not necessitate drug discontinuation.  It is recommended that patients whose platelet count is less than 150,000/mm3 be carefully monitored.</p><p></p><p>There is limited evidence to support either a direct drug-associated platelet effect or platelet destruction due to an IgG antiplatelet antibody.  The exact mechanism is not known.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>A potentially serious hematologic abnormality is thrombocytopenia.  Reduced platelet counts have been seen in 20% to 46% of patients, but were rarely symptomatic.  Thrombocytopenia appears to be related to the total daily dose and duration of infusion and generally has resolved within 2 to 4 days following amrinone withdrawal.</p><p></p><p>Rare cases of hemorrhagic pericardial effusions and splenomegaly have been associated with inamrinone-induced thrombocytopenia.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Cardiovascular side effects have included hypotension, arrhythmias, and heart failure.  Infusion-related hypotension occurred in 1% to 3% of patients.  New cases of sustained atrial and ventricular arrhythmias or worsened congestive heart failure have been reported in 9% of patients.  Some data are from uncontrolled studies and a casual relationship may be difficult to determine due to the serious underlying cardiac disease of the study population.  Chest pain is reported in 0.2% of patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Gastrointestinal symptoms of general abdominal pain, anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting have occurred in up to 27% of patients.  Rare complaints of smell or taste loss have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Nervous system side effects have included dizziness, headache, lightheadedness, or paresthesias in approximately 20% of patients.  Somnolence and fatigue are reported in 3% and 15% of patients, respectively.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Dermatologic side effects have included skin dryness and yellow nail discoloration.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Hepatic toxicity has been reported after long-term oral use of inamrinone.  In a study of 173 patients, approximately 20% developed elevated serum SGOT or LDH levels.  Hepatotoxicity associated with short-term intravenous use has occurred rarely.  Elevations in bilirubin and jaundice have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Cases of reproducible and reversible hepatitis have been associated with inamrinone use.  In some cases, elevated serum transaminases and LDH were accompanied by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophilia suggestive of an allergic drug reaction.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Hypersensitivity to amrinone may present as a generalized viral-like syndrome characterized by myalgias, arthralgias, and fever.  This syndrome may be accompanied by myositis, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, pruritus, and confusion.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Respiratory</h3><p>Respiratory infections have been reported in up to 22% of patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Local</h3><p>Local intravenous site injection pain has been reported in 0.2% of patients.  This may be minimized by diluting the inamrinone infusate in normal or half-normal saline to a final concentration of 1 to 3 mg/mL.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1. "Product Information.
