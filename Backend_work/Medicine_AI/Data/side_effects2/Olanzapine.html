<li>Professional</li></ul><h2>In Summary</h2><p><b>Commonly reported side effects of olanzapine include:</b> asthenia, dizziness, drowsiness, extrapyramidal reaction, hyperkinetic muscle activity, akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, drug-induced parkinson's disease, dyspepsia, mask-like face, and xerostomia. <b>Other side effects include:</b> abnormal gait, back pain, constipation, fever, orthostatic hypotension, weight gain, myoclonus, and personality disorder.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to olanzapine: oral tablet, oral tablet disintegrating</i></p><p>Other dosage forms:</p><ul><li>intramuscular powder for solution, intramuscular powder for suspension extended release</li></ul><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet; Tablet, Disintegrating)</p><p>Risk of death is increased in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the causes of death in clinical trials were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (eg, heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (eg, pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. It is unclear from these studies to what extent the mortality findings may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to patient characteristics. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, olanzapine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>

<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to olanzapine: intramuscular powder for injection, intramuscular powder for injection extended release, oral tablet, oral tablet disintegrating</i></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Post-Injection delirium/sedation syndrome, a collection of signs and symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose has been reported following injections of the extended-release IM suspension.  Events occurred in less than 0.1% of injections and in approximately 2% of patients receiving injections for up to 46 months.  Onset of events ranged from soon after injection to greater than 3 hours later.  The majority of patients were hospitalized and some required supportive care, including intubation.  Two deaths have been reported occurring 3 to 4 days after receiving the appropriate dose of the extended-release IM suspension.  In these patients, very high olanzapine blood levels were reported after death.  A study undertaken to determine the cause of the elevated drug levels in these 2 deaths provides inconclusive results.  As reported in a 3-23-2015 drug safety communication issued by the US Food and Drug Administration, a study in animals found much of the drug level increases could have occurred after death, but the possibility that the deaths were caused by a rapid, but delayed entry of the drug in to the bloodstream could not be ruled out.  </p>

Events occurred in less than 0.1% of injections and in approximately 2% of patients receiving injections for up to 46 months.  Onset of events ranged from soon after injection to greater than 3 hours later.  The majority of patients were hospitalized and some required supportive care, including intubation.  Two deaths have been reported occurring 3 to 4 days after receiving the appropriate dose of the extended-release IM suspension.  In these patients, very high olanzapine blood levels were reported after death.  A study undertaken to determine the cause of the elevated drug levels in these 2 deaths provides inconclusive results.  As reported in a 3-23-2015 drug safety communication issued by the US Food and Drug Administration, a study in animals found much of the drug level increases could have occurred after death, but the possibility that the deaths were caused by a rapid, but delayed entry of the drug in to the bloodstream could not be ruled out.  </p><p></p><p>Akathisia most commonly occurred with oral doses of 15 mg/day; akathisia events included akathisia and hyperkinesia.</p><p></p><p>Dyskinetic events included buccoglossal syndrome, choreoathetosis, dyskinesia, and tardive dyskinesia.</p><p></p><p>Dystonic events included dystonia, generalized spasm, neck rigidity, oculogyric crisis, opisthotonos, and torticollis.</p><p></p><p>Parkinsonism/parkinsonism events most commonly occurred with oral doses of 15 mg/day and included akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, hypokinesia, masked facies, and tremor.</p><p></p><p>Sedation most commonly occurred in adolescent patients given oral doses at least 2.5 mg/day over 3 weeks; sedation included hypersomnia, lethargy, sedation, and somnolence.</p><p></p><p>Somnolence and tremor most commonly occurred with oral doses given with lithium or valproate.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Oral formulations:</p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Somnolence (up to 52%), sedation (up to 48%), akathisia/akathisia events (up to 27%), tremor (up to 23%), parkinsonism/parkinsonism events (up to 20%), dizziness (up to 18%), headache (up to 17%), any extrapyramidal event (up to 10%)</p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Abnormal gait, amnesia, articulation impairment, dyskinesia/dyskinetic events, dystonia/dystonic events, hypertonia, incoordination, mild/transient anticholinergic effects, paresthesia, speech disorder</p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Ataxia, cerebrovascular accident, dysarthria, restless legs syndrome, seizures, stupor, tardive dyskinesia</p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Coma, hangover effect, neuroleptic malignant syndrome</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Akinesia, choreoathetosis, cogwheel rigidity, dyskinesia, dystonia, extrapyramidal disorder, generalized spasm, hypersomnia, hypokinesia, masked facies, movement disorder, myoclonus, opisthotonos, tardive dyskinesia, twitching</p><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Diabetic coma</p><p></p><p>Immediate-release IM injection:</p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Sedation (up to 44.1%)</p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Abnormal gait, akathisia/akathisia events, any extrapyramidal events, dizziness, parkinsonism/parkinsonism events, somnolence, speech disorder, tremor</p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Amnesia, restless legs syndrome, syncope</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Akinesia, choreoathetosis, cogwheel rigidity, dyskinesia, dyskinetic events, dystonia, dystonic events, extrapyramidal disorder, generalized spasm, hyperkinesia, hypersomnia, hypertonia, hypokinesia, masked facies, movement disorder, myoclonus, opisthotonos, twitching</p><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Diabetic coma, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, seizures</p><p></p><p>Extended-release IM injection:</p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Headache/tension headache (up to 18%), sedation/somnolence (up to 13%)</p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Akathisia, dizziness, dysarthria, dyskinesia, hypersomnia, mild/transient anticholinergic effects, parkinsonism, tremor</p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Amnesia, dystonia, seizures, restless legs syndrome, tardive dyskinesia</p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Neuroleptic malignant syndrome</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Abnormal gait, ataxia, cerebrovascular adverse reactions, coma, convulsions, dystonia, extrapyramidal symptoms, speech disorder, tardive extrapyramidal syndromes</p><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Diabetic coma<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Collective data gathered from 17 placebo-controlled clinical studies (n=5106) involving the use of atypical antipsychotic agents, including olanzapine, for the treatment of behavioral disorders in the elderly patient with dementia showed a risk of death 1.6 to 1.7 times greater in the drug treated patient than in the placebo treated patient.
