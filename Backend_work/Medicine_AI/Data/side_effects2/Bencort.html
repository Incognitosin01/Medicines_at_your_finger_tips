Folliculitis has occasionally been reported.</p><p></p><p>Perioral dermatitis or rosacea-like dermatitis has occurred in patients treated with potent topical corticosteroids who are of seborrheic skin type.  This condition may flare temporarily upon discontinuation of topical steroids, prompting patients to continue their use.  If topical corticosteroids are discontinued, this flare and the initial dermatitis generally resolves over a few weeks.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Hypersensitivity reactions have included allergic sensitization in 1% to 5% of patients treated with benzoyl peroxide.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Endocrine</h3><p>Endocrine side effects of topical corticosteroids are rare.  Glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia may be induced by corticosteroids.  These drugs can rarely suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.  This suppression is more likely when higher potency topical steroids are used over extensive areas and when occlusive dressings are used.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1. "Product Information.
