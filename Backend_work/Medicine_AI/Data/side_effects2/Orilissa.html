She was reported to have no relevant past medical history; life stressors were noted.  Of the 2090 patients exposed to this drug, there were 4 reports of suicidal ideation, 3 had a history of depression.</p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Insomnia, mood altered, mood swings, depressed mood, depression, depressive symptoms and/or tearfulness, anxiety, decreased libido, irritability</p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Completed suicide, suicidal ideation</p><h3>Genitourinary</h3><p>Dose-dependent reduction in mean number of bleeding and spotting days and bleeding intensity was reported in electronic diaries.  Amenorrhea was reported in 6% to 17% of patients receiving 150 mg/day and 13% to 52% of those receiving 200 mg twice a day during the first 6 months of therapy.  During the second 6 months the incidence of amenorrhea was 11% to 15% and 46% to 57%, respectively.  Six months after stopping therapy (150 mg/day), menses resumed in 59%, 87%, and 95% of women within 1, 2, and 6 months, respectively.  After stopping therapy following 6 months at 200 mg twice a day, resumption of menses was reported in 60%, 88%, and 97% of women within 1, 2, and 6 months, respectively.</p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Amenorrhea (up to 57%) </p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Reduction in mean number of bleeding and spotting days and bleeding intensity</p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): ALT elevations</p><p>Dose-dependent asymptomatic elevations of serum ALT to 3 times the upper limit normal occurred at 0.2% and 1.1% of patients receiving 150 mg/day (n=450) and 200 mg twice a day (n=443) respectively; placebo 0.1% (n=696).</p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>During clinical trials, dose dependent increases in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and serum triglycerides occurred.  Mean changes of LDL at 6 months were 5 and 13 mg/dL in patients receiving 150 mg/day and 200 mg twice a day, respectively.  Mean change in HDL was 2 and 4 mg/dL in patients receiving 150 mg/day and 200 mg twice a day, respectively.  Mean change in serum triglycerides was less than 1 and 11 mg/dL in patients receiving 150 mg/day and 200 mg twice a day, respectively.

In the blinded extension study in which patients continued treatment for 12 months, these numbers increased to 8% and 21%.  In study 2, the percent of subjects with greater than an 8% decrease in BMD was less than 1%, 6%, and 0% in patients dosed with 150 mg/day, 200 mg twice a day, and placebo, respectively.
