Quinolone class antibiotics have been associated with peripheral neuropathy, possible exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, and dysphasia.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Spontaneous reporting of adverse effects to the FDA has revealed the rate of CNS toxicity related to lomefloxacin to generally be higher than that of other fluoroquinolones.  These reports have included dizziness, tremors, anxiety, and seizures.</p><p></p><p>A 38-year-old male developed persistent (6 year duration) symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including twitching, numbness, "electrical" sensation, tingling, pain, hypesthesia, muscle/joint pain, fatigue, and multiple CNS symptoms.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Hypersensitivity reactions resulting in rash and pruritus have been reported in up to 1% of patients treated with lomefloxacin.  Photosensitivity can occur in up to 2.4% of treated patients.  Photosensitivity reactions have occurred up to 3 weeks after drug ingestion.

These reactions have also occurred in patients exposed to shaded or diffuse light, including exposure through glass.  Rarely, phototoxic reactions have occurred several weeks after discontinuation of lomefloxacin.  Exposure to sunlight should be avoided during lomefloxacin therapy, even when a sunscreen is used.  Exposure should also be avoided for several days after lomefloxacin is discontinued.  Patients should be advised to discontinue lomefloxacin use at the first sign of a phototoxic reaction.</p><p></p><p>A case of Henoch-Schonlein purpura has been reported in a patient treated with lomefloxacin.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Dermatologic side effects have included photosensitivity (2.3%).
