See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine: oral tablet</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet)</p><p>Hypersensitivity Reactions:Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir-containing products. Hypersensitivity to abacavir is a multi-organ clinical syndrome. Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. The abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine combination is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA-B*5701-positive patients. Discontinue abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine as soon as a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. Regardless of HLA-B*5701 status, permanently discontinue abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible. Following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine, never restart abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine combination or any other abacavir-containing product.Hematologic Toxicity:Hematologic toxicity, including neutropenia and anemia, has been associated with the use of zidovudine, a component of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine combination.Myopathy:Symptomatic myopathy associated with prolonged use of zidovudine.Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis:Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur.Exacerbations of Hepatitis B:Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV-1 and have discontinued lamivudine, a component of the abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine combination. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, abacavir / lamivudine / zidovudine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>

<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to abacavir / lamivudine / zidovudine: oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>Many of the side effects listed occurred commonly in patients with abacavir hypersensitivity (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, lethargy, rash).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with abacavir.  Such reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and usually occurred within the first 6 weeks of abacavir therapy (median onset: 9 to 11 days); however, abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during therapy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Patients with the human leukocyte antigen subtype B*5701 (HLA-B*5701) allele are at higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; however, such reactions have occurred in patients without the HLA-B*5701 allele.  Abacavir hypersensitivity was reported in about 8% of patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where patients were not screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele; incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions was 1% in clinical trials where HLA-B*5701 carriers were excluded.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have been characterized by at least 2 of the following key signs/symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, pharyngitis).  Almost all reactions have included fever and/or rash (usually maculopapular or urticarial); however, reactions also reported without fever or rash.  Signs/symptoms reported in at least 10% of patients with hypersensitivity reaction have included rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, cough, fever, fatigue/lethargy, malaise, headache, elevated liver function tests, and myalgia.  Other signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity have included mouth ulceration, sore throat, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, edema, lymphadenopathy, hypotension, conjunctivitis, anaphylaxis, paresthesia, lymphopenia, hepatitis, liver failure, myolysis, arthralgia, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, renal failure, abnormal chest x-ray findings (mainly infiltrates, which were localized), and death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Symptoms of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction worsened with continued therapy and generally resolved when abacavir was discontinued.  Restarting abacavir after a hypersensitivity reaction has resulted in more severe symptoms within hours and included life-threatening hypotension and death.  Rarely, life-threatening reactions have occurred within hours after restarting abacavir in patients who stopped it for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity (or who stopped it with only 1 key symptom of hypersensitivity).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Hypersensitivity reaction</p>

<p>Zidovudine has been associated with hematologic toxicity (including neutropenia and severe anemia), particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease.  Anemia, neutropenia, and leukopenia were reported more often with higher doses (1200 to 1500 mg/day) and in patients with advanced HIV disease (especially with poor bone marrow reserve at baseline) and particularly in those with CD4 cell counts less than 100/mm3.  These hematological effects were generally observed after 4 to 6 weeks of therapy.  Incidence of neutropenia increased in patients with low neutrophil counts, hemoglobin levels, and serum vitamin B12 levels at baseline.</p>

</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to abacavir / lamivudine / zidovudine: oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>Many of the side effects listed occurred commonly in patients with abacavir hypersensitivity (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, lethargy, rash).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with abacavir.  Such reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and usually occurred within the first 6 weeks of abacavir therapy (median onset: 9 to 11 days); however, abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during therapy.</p><p></p><p>Patients with the human leukocyte antigen subtype B*5701 (HLA-B*5701) allele are at higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; however, such reactions have occurred in patients without the HLA-B*5701 allele.  Abacavir hypersensitivity was reported in about 8% of patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where patients were not screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele; incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions was 1% in clinical trials where HLA-B*5701 carriers were excluded.</p><p></p><p>Abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have been characterized by at least 2 of the following key signs/symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, pharyngitis).  Almost all reactions have included fever and/or rash (usually maculopapular or urticarial); however, reactions also reported without fever or rash.  Signs/symptoms reported in at least 10% of patients with hypersensitivity reaction have included rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, cough, fever, fatigue/lethargy, malaise, headache, elevated liver function tests, and myalgia.  Other signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity have included mouth ulceration, sore throat, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, edema, lymphadenopathy, hypotension, conjunctivitis, anaphylaxis, paresthesia, lymphopenia, hepatitis, liver failure, myolysis, arthralgia, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, renal failure, abnormal chest x-ray findings (mainly infiltrates, which were localized), and death.</p><p></p><p>Symptoms of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction worsened with continued therapy and generally resolved when abacavir was discontinued.  Restarting abacavir after a hypersensitivity reaction has resulted in more severe symptoms within hours and included life-threatening hypotension and death.  Rarely, life-threatening reactions have occurred within hours after restarting abacavir in patients who stopped it for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity (or who stopped it with only 1 key symptom of hypersensitivity).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Hypersensitivity reaction</p><p></p><p>Abacavir, lamivudine, and/or zidovudine:</p><p>-Postmarketing reports: Sensitization reactions (including anaphylaxis)</p><p></p><p>Abacavir:</p><p>-Common (1% to 10%): Hypersensitivity reactions (including fever, rash [maculopapular, urticarial], fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, pharyngitis, malaise, achiness, dyspnea, cough, lethargy, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, myolysis, edema, abnormal chest X-ray findings [mainly localized infiltrates], paresthesia, anaphylaxis, hepatitis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, sore throat, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, death, lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions [conjunctivitis, mouth ulceration], erythema multiforme, elevated liver function tests, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, lymphopenia)<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Nausea (up to 52%), nausea and vomiting (up to 22%), diarrhea (up to 15%)</p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort and pain, gaseous symptoms, dyspeptic symptoms, constipation</p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Dry mouth/hyposalivation</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Abdominal cramps</p><p></p><p>Abacavir, lamivudine, and/or zidovudine:</p><p>-Postmarketing reports: Abdominal pain, oral mucosal pigmentation, stomatitis, dyspepsia</p><p></p><p>Abacavir:</p><p>-Common (1% to 10%): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea</p><p>-Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Pancreatitis</p><p></p><p>Lamivudine:</p><p>-Common (1% to 10%): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain</p><p>-Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Elevated serum amylase, pancreatitis</p><p>-Frequency not reported: Oral ulcerations and lesions</p><p></p><p>Zidovudine:</p><p>-Very common (10% or more): Nausea</p><p>-Common (1% to 10%): Vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea</p><p>-Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Flatulence</p><p>-Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Oral mucosa pigmentation, dyspepsia, pancreatitis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Pancreatitis was observed in the expanded access program for abacavir.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Malaise and fatigue (up to 29%)</p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Temperature regulation disturbance (fever and/or chills), pain, ear/nose/throat infections</p><p></p><p>Abacavir, lamivudine, and/or zidovudine:</p><p>-Postmarketing reports: Weakness</p><p></p><p>Abacavir:</p><p>-Common (1% to 10%): Fever, lethargy, fatigue</p><p></p><p>Lamivudine:</p><p>-Common (1% to 10%): Fatigue, malaise, fever</p><p>-Frequency not reported: Drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV)</p><p></p><p>Zidovudine:</p><p>-Common (1% to 10%): Malaise</p><p>-Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Fever, generalized pain, asthenia</p><p>-Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Chills, chest pain, influenza-like syndrome</p><p>The emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been reported in HIV-1/HBV-coinfected patients using lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens.</p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients using abacavir primarily in combination with agents known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively.</p><p></p><p>Cases of erythema multiforme, SJS, or TEN have been reported very rarely when abacavir hypersensitivity could not be ruled out.</p><p></p><p>Bluish or brownish-black discoloration of nails has developed during the first 1 or 2 months of zidovudine therapy and usually disappeared within 2 months if the drug was discontinued.
