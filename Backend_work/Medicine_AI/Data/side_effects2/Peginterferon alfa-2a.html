The most common serious side effect was bacterial infection (including sepsis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pyelonephritis, pneumonia).  Other serious side effects were suicide, suicidal ideation, psychosis, aggression, anxiety, drug abuse and drug overdose, angina, hepatic dysfunction, fatty liver, cholangitis, arrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune phenomena (e.g., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), peripheral neuropathy, aplastic anemia, peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis, colitis, corneal ulcer, pulmonary embolism, coma, myositis, cerebral hemorrhage, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, psychotic disorder, and hallucination.  The most common side effects were psychiatric reactions (including depression, insomnia, irritability, anxiety), influenza-like symptoms (such as fatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, headache, rigors), anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgias, injection site reactions, alopecia, and pruritus.  Psychiatric disorders, influenza-like syndrome (e.g., lethargy, fatigue, headache), dermatologic disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and laboratory abnormalities (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia) were the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In clinical trials, patients with chronic hepatitis B had similar side effects as CHC patients using peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy, except for exacerbations of hepatitis.  The most common or important serious side effects in the hepatitis B studies were infections (sepsis, appendicitis, tuberculosis, influenza), hepatitis B flares, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, pyrexia, headache, fatigue, myalgia, alopecia, and anorexia.  Therapy was discontinued most often due to laboratory abnormalities (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, ALT elevation).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Headache (monotherapy: up to 54%; combination therapy: 43%), dizziness excluding vertigo (monotherapy: 16%; combination therapy: 14%), and memory impairment (monotherapy: 5%; combination therapy: 5%) have been reported in CHC patients.</p>

The most common serious side effect was bacterial infection (including sepsis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pyelonephritis, pneumonia).  Other serious side effects were suicide, suicidal ideation, psychosis, aggression, anxiety, drug abuse and drug overdose, angina, hepatic dysfunction, fatty liver, cholangitis, arrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune phenomena (e.g., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), peripheral neuropathy, aplastic anemia, peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis, colitis, corneal ulcer, pulmonary embolism, coma, myositis, cerebral hemorrhage, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, psychotic disorder, and hallucination.  The most common side effects were psychiatric reactions (including depression, insomnia, irritability, anxiety), influenza-like symptoms (such as fatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, headache, rigors), anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgias, injection site reactions, alopecia, and pruritus.  Psychiatric disorders, influenza-like syndrome (e.g., lethargy, fatigue, headache), dermatologic disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and laboratory abnormalities (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia) were the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy.</p><p></p><p>In clinical trials, patients with chronic hepatitis B had similar side effects as CHC patients using peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy, except for exacerbations of hepatitis.  The most common or important serious side effects in the hepatitis B studies were infections (sepsis, appendicitis, tuberculosis, influenza), hepatitis B flares, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, pyrexia, headache, fatigue, myalgia, alopecia, and anorexia.  Therapy was discontinued most often due to laboratory abnormalities (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, ALT elevation).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Headache (monotherapy: up to 54%; combination therapy: 43%), dizziness excluding vertigo (monotherapy: 16%; combination therapy: 14%), and memory impairment (monotherapy: 5%; combination therapy: 5%) have been reported in CHC patients.</p><p></p><p>Tinnitus was reported in up to 2% of CHC patients coinfected with HIV using peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin.</p><p></p><p>A 40-year-old male coinfected with hepatitis C virus and HIV experienced chorea and akathisia coincident with peginterferon alfa-2a therapy.  He was administered subcutaneous peginterferon alfa-2a 180 mcg weekly and oral ribavirin 1 g daily.  At week 20 of therapy, the patient presented to the clinic complaining of irritability, difficulty in sleeping, and prominent choreiform involuntary movements with myoclonic activity of the upper and lower extremities.  He was diagnosed with chorea and akathisia.  He was treated with ropinirole, propranolol, and clonazepam.  Peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin were discontinued with complete resolution of symptoms after 5 days.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Dizziness (up to 89%), headache (up to 56%), concentration impairment</p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Vertigo, syncope, migraine, memory impairment, weakness, hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, taste disturbance, somnolence, tinnitus</p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Peripheral neuropathy, hearing loss</p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Cerebral hemorrhage, coma, convulsions, facial palsy</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Cerebral ischemia, chorea and akathisia</p><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Seizures, hearing impairment<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Influenza-like signs/symptoms, fatigue/asthenia (up to 65%), pyrexia (up to 54%), fatigue (up to 51%), rigors (up to 35%), asthenia (up to 30%), pain (up to 11%), overall resistance mechanism disorders (up to 12%)</p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Fever, chills, chest pain, influenza-like illness, malaise, lethargy, shivering, hot flushes, thirst, infections (fungal, viral, bacterial), peripheral edema, flushing, earache</p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Mucosal hyperpigmentation, otitis externa, substance overdose</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Bacterial infections (e.g., sepsis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pyelonephritis, pneumonia), infections (appendicitis, tuberculosis, influenza)<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Influenza-like signs and symptoms (fatigue/asthenia [monotherapy: 56%; combination therapy: 65%], pyrexia [monotherapy: up to 54%; combination therapy: 41%], rigors [monotherapy: 35%; combination therapy: 25%], pain [monotherapy: 11%; combination therapy: 10%]) and overall resistance mechanism disorders (monotherapy: 10%; combination therapy: 12%) have been reported in CHC patients.</p><p></p><p>The most common or important serious side effects reported during hepatitis B studies have included infections (sepsis, appendicitis, tuberculosis, influenza).</p><p></p><p>Fatigue has been reported in 24% of patients during hepatitis B studies.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Musculoskeletal</h3><p>Myalgia (monotherapy: up to 37%; combination therapy: 40%), arthralgia (monotherapy: 28%; combination therapy: 22%), and back pain (monotherapy: 9%; combination therapy: 5%) have been reported in CHC patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Myalgia (up to 44%), arthralgia (up to 32%)</p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Back pain, arthritis, muscle weakness, bone pain, neck pain, musculoskeletal pain, muscle cramps</p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Myositis</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Rhabdomyolysis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p>Neutropenia (monotherapy: 21%; combination therapy: up to 40%), lymphopenia (monotherapy: 3%; combination therapy: 14%), anemia (monotherapy: 2%; combination therapy: up to 14%), and thrombocytopenia (monotherapy: 5%; combination therapy: up to 8%) have been reported in CHC patients.</p><p></p><p>Moderate (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] 0.5 to 0.749 x 10[9]/L: 24%) and severe (ANC less than 0.5 x 10[9]/L: 5%) neutropenia was reported in patients using peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin for 48 weeks.</p><p></p><p>In 1 study, CHC patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and baseline platelet counts as low as 50,000/mm3 were treated for 48 weeks.
