See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to ribavirin: oral capsule, oral tablet</i></p><p>Other dosage forms:</p><ul><li>inhalation powder for solution</li></ul><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet; Capsule; Solution)</p><p>Ribavirin monotherapy is ineffective for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The primary toxicity is hemolytic anemia, which may result in worsening of cardiac disease and fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions. Avoid use in patients with significant or unstable cardiac disease. Significant teratogenic and embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin. Ribavirin is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in male partners of women who are pregnant. Use 2 reliable forms of contraception and avoid pregnancy during therapy and for 6 months after completion of treatment in both female patients and in female partners of male patients who are taking ribavirin.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, ribavirin may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>

<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to ribavirin: compounding powder, inhalation powder for reconstitution, oral capsule, oral solution, oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>The most common serious or life-threatening side effects induced or aggravated by ribavirin tablets in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a have included depression, suicide, relapse of drug abuse/overdose, and bacterial infections in less than 1% of patients and hepatic decompensation in 2% of chronic hepatitis C (CHC)-HIV coinfected patients.  The most common serious side effect in CHC monoinfected (3%) and CHC-HIV coinfected (5%) patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a alone or in combination with ribavirin tablets was bacterial infection (e.g., sepsis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pyelonephritis, pneumonia).  Common side effects reported in CHC-HIV coinfected patients receiving ribavirin tablets in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a have included neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, weight decrease, and mood alteration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The most common side effects reported in patients receiving ribavirin capsules/oral solution in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b were injection site inflammation/reaction, fatigue/asthenia, headache, rigors, fevers, nausea, myalgia, and anxiety/emotional lability/irritability.  The most common serious side effects associated with peginterferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin capsules/oral solution were depression and suicidal ideation in less than 1% of patients.  The most common fatal side effects reported in patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin capsules/oral solution were cardiac arrest, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt in less than 1% of patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Respiratory</h3><p>Mechanically ventilated patients may be predisposed to respiratory deterioration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Severe hypoxia was described in a case report of a previously healthy infant who experienced a dramatic drop in transcutaneous oxygen within 1 minute of receiving ribavirin.  Oxygen levels returned to normal promptly following discontinuation of therapy.  However, the infant later died, and postmortem examination revealed a high pulmonary arterial pressure and a patent ductus arteriosus.  A definitive causal relationship was not established, and equipment failure was not specifically ruled out by the authors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most signs and symptoms reported in exposed health care workers resolved within minutes to hours of stopping close exposure to aerosolized ribavirin.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Respiratory side effects associated with oral ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a, peginterferon alfa-2b, or interferon alfa-2b have included dyspnea (up to 26%), cough (up to 23%), and exertional dyspnea (up to 7%).
