These side effects were reversible within 3 to 48 hours of stopping therapy and occurred less often with low doses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pseudotumor cerebri, bulging fontanels (infants), and decreased hearing have also been reported during postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Hyperpigmentation of various body sites (including the skin, nails, teeth, oral mucosa, bones, thyroid, eyes [including sclera, conjunctiva], breast milk, lacrimal secretions, perspiration) has been reported.  This blue/black/grey or muddy-brown discoloration was localized or diffuse.  The most common site was the skin.  Pigmentation often reversed when the drug was discontinued; however, resolution took several months or persisted in some cases.  The generalized muddy-brown skin pigmentation sometimes persisted, especially in areas exposed to sun.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Biopsies of pigmented tissue have shown granules within the cells which stained positive for iron.  This pigmentation faded over time after drug discontinuation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DRESS syndrome (including fatal cases) has been reported.  DRESS syndrome with persistent myocarditis has been reported in at least 3 cases.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fixed drug eruptions, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and photosensitivity have also been reported during postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Pruritus, urticaria</p>

<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Antibiotic-associated colitis, oral cavity discoloration (including buccal mucosa, tongue, lip, gum), abdominal cramping, inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the oral and anogenital regions<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Pancreatitis has rarely been associated with use of this drug.  In 2 case reports, cystic fibrosis patients experienced pancreatitis during treatment with this drug for acute bacterial exacerbations of respiratory disease.  The authors suggested that cystic fibrosis patients, as a result of the disease process, may be more susceptible to drug-induced pancreatitis.  Additionally, in at least 1 case, multiple concomitant medications were taken; therefore, a temporal relationship between this drug and pancreatitis could not be proven conclusively.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients taking the capsule or tablet formulations of tetracycline-class antibiotics.  Most of these patients took the drug immediately before going to bed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Enterocolitis, pancreatitis, glossitis, dysphagia, and tooth discoloration have also been reported during postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Musculoskeletal</h3><p>Lupus-like reactions induced by this drug have commonly presented with arthralgia or arthritis, myalgia or malaise, and positive ANA titer.  Patients with highly positive anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies have rarely been reported.  All patients recovered after the drug was discontinued; however, several required short courses of corticosteroids.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Severe acute myopathy associated with this drug (100 mg orally per day) occurred in a 17-year-old male after strenuous exercise.  His laboratory values were as follows: ESR 33 mm/hr, CRP 0.84 mg/dL, creatine kinase 87,297 units/L, AST 1307 units/L, ALT 311 units/L, LDH 4935 units/L, aldolase 12.6 units/L, alkaline phosphatase 145 units/L, GGT 66 units/L.  Muscle enzyme levels normalized and his symptoms resolved 1 month after this drug was discontinued.</p>
<p></p>
<p>IV minocycline (the active ingredient contained in Minocin) plus quinupristin-dalfopristin were associated with myalgia and arthralgia in 36% of neutropenic cancer patients (n=56).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Arthralgia, myalgia</p>

<p></p>
<p>Pulmonary infiltrates, night sweats, fever, and eosinophilia have developed in several patients receiving this drug.  These effects were thought to be due to drug hypersensitivity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Case reports have described a severe CNS -pulmonary hypersensitivity syndrome requiring high-dose corticosteroid therapy.  Signs and symptoms have included dry cough, fever, ataxia, muscle weakness, numbness, visual abnormalities, abnormal brain MRI, seizures, pulmonary infiltrates, elevated serum IgE, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and eosinophilia.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eosinophilic pneumonia with relapsing acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and corticosteroids has been reported in a 54-year-old woman.  Initial symptoms included dry cough, low-grade fever, fatigue, and dyspnea.  Eosinophilia, elevated leukocytes, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were noted.  At 14 days after being discharged and resuming this drug, the patient developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure again requiring mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Late-onset drug fever (associated with fever, sore throat, abdominal pain, weakness, loose bloody stools, fatigue, 40-pound weight loss, ESR 99 mm/hr, CRP 5 mg/dL, and mild increases in liver enzymes) has been reported in a 15-year-old boy after using this drug for 24 months for acne.  After 1 year of therapy, at least 1 other case of late-onset drug fever occurred.  Other reported cases of drug fever generally occurred after 2 to 4 weeks of drug exposure.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction (including shock, fatalities)</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity syndrome (consisting of cutaneous reaction [e.g., rash, exfoliative dermatitis], eosinophilia, and at least 1 of the following: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, pericarditis; with or without fever, lymphadenopathy), serum sickness-like syndrome (consisting of fever, urticaria/rash, arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness/swelling, lymphadenopathy; with or without eosinophilia), autoimmune vasculitis, drug fever, eosinophilic pneumonitis, drug hypersensitivity (e.g., pulmonary infiltrates, night sweats, fever, eosinophilia), serum sickness, serum sickness-like reactions, severe central nervous system (CNS)-pulmonary hypersensitivity syndrome</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Immunologic</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers, polyarteritis nodosa, ANCA-positive crescentic glomerulonephritis, ANCA-positive vasculitis, autoimmune hepatitis, necrotizing vasculitis and systemic reactions<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Rare cases of necrotizing vasculitis and systemic reactions have been reported, characterized by lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, increased liver function enzyme levels, and dermatologic involvement.  In each case, this drug was discontinued and in some cases, corticosteroid therapy was necessary to assist in the resolution of symptoms.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Increased liver enzymes, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis/hepatotoxicity</p>
<p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Hepatic cholestasis, hepatic failure (including fatalities), hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Autoimmune hepatitis with lupus-like symptoms, increased liver function test values, acute hepatic failure, liver injury, acute hypersensitivity hepatitis associated with eosinophilia and dermatitis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Some hepatic reactions had an autoimmune basis and occurred after several months of therapy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1 case, a patient developed rapidly progressing liver failure after using this drug for 4 weeks for acne.  The patient had stopped this drug 2 weeks prior to onset of malaise.  Liver transplantation was considered, but the patient slowly recovered without significant intervention.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Other reports of immunologically-mediated progressive liver dysfunction have rarely occurred.  In 1 case, a patient received a liver transplant after fulminant hepatic failure which was thought to be related to a 3-year history of daily therapy to treat acne.  The dose of this drug ranged from 50 to 200 mg/day.  A second patient had been using this drug to treat acne for 1 year just prior to seeking medical attention for an "influenza-like" syndrome.  Upon hospitalization, it was determined that the patient was experiencing an autoimmune-mediated hepatitis, most probably related to this drug.  Resolution of symptoms occurred in both of these cases after therapy was discontinued and each patient had received appropriate supportive medical care.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hepatitis and liver failure have also been reported during postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Increased BUN/serum urea, interstitial nephritis, acute renal failure</p>
