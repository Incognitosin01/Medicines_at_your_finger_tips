Serious side effects were reported in 2% (12 weeks therapy) and 3% (24 weeks therapy) of patients, respectively.  The most common side effects reported in patients using this drug plus sofosbuvir for 12 or 24 weeks were fatigue, headache, rash (including photosensitivity reaction), diarrhea, dizziness, nausea, constipation, and pruritus.  Therapy was discontinued due to side effects in 1% (12 weeks therapy) and 6% (24 weeks therapy) of patients, respectively.</p><p></p><p>In clinical trials, most side effects reported in HCV genotype 1-infected patients using this drug with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for 12 weeks were grade 1 to 2 in severity; grade 3 or 4 side effects were reported in up to 23% of patients using this drug with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin and in up to 25% using placebo with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.  Serious side effects were reported in up to 2% of patients using this drug with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin and in up to 3% using placebo with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.  During the first 12 weeks of therapy with this drug plus peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, the most common side effects were rash (including photosensitivity), nausea, pruritus, myalgia, dyspnea, increased blood bilirubin, and photosensitivity reaction.  This drug was discontinued due to side effects in up to 2% of patients using this drug with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.</p><p></p><p>The manufacturer product information for coadministered HCV antiviral drugs should be consulted for associated side effects.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Increased blood bilirubin (term included increased conjugated bilirubin, increased blood bilirubin, increased unconjugated blood bilirubin, hyperbilirubinemia; up to 66%)</p><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Hepatic decompensation, hepatic failure<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Grade 1, 2, and 3 hyperbilirubinemia were reported in 12%, 3%, and less than 1% of patients using this drug plus sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, respectively.  Grade 1, 2, and 4 hyperbilirubinemia were reported in 16%, 3%, and 3% of patients using this drug plus sofosbuvir for 24 weeks, respectively.  In 1 trial, increased bilirubin was reported in no patients using this drug plus sofosbuvir (without ribavirin) for 12 weeks versus 9.3% of patients using this drug plus sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks.</p><p></p><p>During the 12 weeks of therapy with this drug plus peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 hyperbilirubinemia were reported in 26.7%, 18.3%, 4.1%, and 0.4% of patients, respectively.  Bilirubin elevations were mostly mild to moderate in severity, and included elevation of both direct and indirect bilirubin.  Bilirubin elevations occurred soon after therapy started, peaked by the second week, and reversed quickly after this drug was stopped.  In general, bilirubin elevations (direct and indirect) were not associated with liver transaminase elevations. The incidence of increased bilirubin was higher in patients with increased simeprevir exposures (e.g., patients with severe liver dysfunction); such bilirubin increases were not associated with any adverse liver safety finding.</p><p></p><p>Compared to a pooled phase 3 population from global trials, East Asian patients using this drug with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin had a higher incidence of hyperbilirubinemia; elevated total bilirubin (all grades) was reported in up to 66% of patients.  Bilirubin elevations were primarily grade 1 or 2; grade 3 bilirubin elevations were reported in up to 9% of patients.  Bilirubin elevations were not associated with liver transaminase elevations and were reversible after therapy ended.</p><p></p><p>Hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure (including fatalities) have been reported with this drug coadministered with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin or with sofosbuvir.  Most reports occurred in patients with advanced and/or decompensated cirrhosis.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>In trials of this drug plus sofosbuvir, rash (including photosensitivity reactions) was reported in 12% and 16% of patients receiving therapy for 12 and 24 weeks, respectively; pruritus was reported in 8.4% (12 weeks therapy) and 3.2% (24 weeks therapy) of patients.  Most rash events were of mild or moderate severity (grade 1 or 2); most photosensitivity reactions were of mild severity (grade 1).  Grade 3 rash was reported in 1 patient; therapy was discontinued.  In 1 trial, rash was reported in 10.7% of patients using this drug plus sofosbuvir (without ribavirin) for 12 weeks versus 20.4% of patients using this drug plus sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks.</p><p></p><p>Photosensitivity reactions (all grades) were reported in 3.1% (12 weeks therapy) and 6.5% (24 weeks therapy) of patients using this drug plus sofosbuvir.

In 1 trial, photosensitivity reactions were reported in 7.1% of patients using this drug plus sofosbuvir (without ribavirin) for 12 weeks versus 5.6% of patients using this drug plus sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks.</p><p></p><p>In trials of this drug plus peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, rash (including photosensitivity reactions) and pruritus were reported in up to 28% and 21.9% of patients, respectively, during the 12 weeks with this drug.  Fifty-six percent (56%) of rash events occurred in the first 4 weeks; 42% in the first 2 weeks.  Most rash and pruritus events were of mild or moderate severity (grade 1 or 2); severe rash and pruritus (grade 3) were reported in up to 1% and 0.1% of patients, respectively.  This drug was discontinued due to rash and pruritus in up to 1% and 0.1% of patients, respectively.  The frequencies of rash and photosensitivity reactions were higher in those with higher simeprevir (the active ingredient contained in Olysio) exposures.</p><p></p><p>All trial subjects were directed to use sun protection measures.  In these trials, photosensitivity (specifically) was reported in 5% of patients during the 12 weeks of therapy with this drug plus peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.
