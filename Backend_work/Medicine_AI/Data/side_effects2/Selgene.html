<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to selegiline: compounding powder, oral capsule, oral tablet, oral tablet disintegrating, transdermal film extended release</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>In prospective pre-marketing studies, the most commonly reported side effects leading to treatment discontinuation with selegiline (the active ingredient contained in Selgene) oral tablets were, in decreasing order of frequency, nausea, hallucinations, confusion, depression, loss of balance, insomnia, orthostatic hypotension, increased akinetic involuntary movements, agitation, arrhythmia, bradykinesia, chorea, delusions, hypertension, new or increased angina pectoris, and syncope.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In clinical trials with selegiline orally disintegrating tablets, the most commonly reported side effects leading to treatment discontinuation were dizziness, chest pain, accidental injury, and myasthenia.  The relative risk for treatment-emergent hypertension and orthostatic or postural hypotension was reported as being at least 2 fold greater in patients 65 years or older compared to those younger than 65 years.  Patients over 65 years were also reported at an increased risk for somnolence compared to younger patients.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In clinical trials with selegiline transdermal patches, application site reaction was reported as the side effect that lead to treatment discontinuation in at least 1% of patients at a rate at least twice that of placebo.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Selegiline potentiates the effects of levodopa; therefore, the side effects of levodopa may be emphasized unless the levodopa dose is reduced.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Psychiatric</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Insomnia</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Anxiety/tension, confusion, depression, euphoria, hallucinations, illusion, sleeping disorders, vivid dreams</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Abnormal dreams, agitation, manic reaction, mild transient irritability, mood change, psychoses</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Apathy, delusions, disorientation, dreams/nightmares, hollow feeling, overstimulation, personality change, sleep disturbance, transient high, transient irritability</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Abnormal thinking, aggressive reaction, bruxism, delirium, impulse control disorders and compulsions, nervousness, paranoid reaction, paroniria, psychotic-like behavior<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Insomnia and sleep disorder were reported as very common side effects with selegiline in double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials at a higher frequency when used as adjunctive therapy with levodopa in the earlier phases of Parkinson's disease.  Insomnia was also reported as a very common side effect in placebo-controlled clinical trials for major depressive disorder with transdermal selegiline.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Parkinson's disease patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments such as selegiline have been reported as exhibiting impulse control disorders such as pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending/buying, and binge eating.  There have been very few cases reported with selegiline.  In some cases, dose reduction or treatment discontinuation led to cessation of impulse control disorders.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Postmarketing reports have indicated that patients taking this drug may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, such as psychotic-like behavior, particularly after starting therapy or increasing the dose.  Certain medications used to treat psychosis (e.g., dopamine antagonists) may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of selegiline.  Transient high and bruxism were reported at doses greater than 10 mg per day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anxiety was reported as a very common side effect with selegiline in double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials when used as adjunctive therapy with levodopa in the earlier phases of Parkinson's disease.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.  An increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults (aged 18 to 24 years) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders has been reported with short-term use of antidepressant drugs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adult and pediatric patients receiving antidepressants for MDD, as well as for psychiatric and nonpsychiatric indications, have reported symptoms that may be precursors to emerging suicidality, including anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, and mania.  Causality has not been established.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Dizziness/lightheadedness/fainting</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Abnormal movements (e.g., dyskinesias, bradykinesia, akinesia), ataxia, headache, impaired balance, lethargy, somnolence, syncope, tremor</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Chorea, drowsiness, dyskinesia, dystonic symptoms, facial grimace, festination, impaired memory, increased apraxia, involuntary movements, migraine, myoclonic jerks, numbness of toes/fingers, restlessness, speech affected, supraorbital pain, tardive dyskinesia</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Abnormal gait, cerebrovascular disorder, coma, convulsions, hypertonia, involuntary muscle contractions, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, taste disturbance<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>There have been reports of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles, which sometimes resulted in accidents, in Parkinson's disease patients treated with this drug.  These reports have occurred in a setting of pre-existing somnolence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Impaired memory and myoclonic jerks were reported at doses greater than 10 mg per day.  Seizure in dialyzed chronic renal failure in a patient treated with selegiline on concomitant medications has been reported in postmarketing experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome, with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in, antiparkinson therapy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal cases of serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of this drug with antidepressants.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Headache was reported as a very common side effect in placebo-controlled clinical trials for major depressive disorder with transdermal selegiline.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Postural hypotension</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Arrhythmia, bradycardia, chest pain, hypertension, hypotension, edema, palpitations</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Angina pectoris, ankle edema, orthostatic hypotension, supraventricular tachycardia</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Peripheral edema, hematoma, tachycardia</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Flushing, myocardial infarction<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>This drug inhibits the catabolism of dietary amines such as tyramine, and has the potential to produce a hypertensive crisis following the ingestion of tyramine-rich foods or beverages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Postural hypotension was reported with selegiline in double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials at a higher frequency when used as adjunctive therapy with levodopa in the earlier phases of Parkinson's disease compared to the late phase.  Palpitation was also reported as a very common side effect in the earlier phases of Parkinson's disease in these trials.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Dry mouth, irritation of the buccal mucosa (orally disintegrating tablet), mouth ulceration, nausea, stomatitis</p>

<p></p>
<p>Vertigo was a very common side effect reported with selegiline (the active ingredient contained in Selgene) in double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials when used as adjunctive therapy with levodopa compared with its use as monotherapy.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Fatigue</p>
