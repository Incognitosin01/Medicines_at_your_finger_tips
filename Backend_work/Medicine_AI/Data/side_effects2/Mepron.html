<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to atovaquone: oral suspension</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>In PCP prevention studies comparing atovaquone (the active ingredient contained in Mepron) to inhaled pentamidine, 16% to 25% of patients discontinued atovaquone and 7% discontinued pentamidine due to adverse events.  Rash (6%), diarrhea (4%), and nausea (3%) were the most common reasons for discontinuing atovaquone, while bronchospasm (2%) was the most common reason for discontinuing pentamidine.  In studies comparing atovaquone to dapsone, treatment-limiting hypersensitivity reactions were more frequent in the dapsone group (16.1%) and treatment-limiting gastrointestinal side effects were more common in the atovaquone group (up to 4.1%).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In PCP treatment studies, 9% of patients discontinued atovaquone due to side effects, compared to 24% of patients receiving sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.  The most common reason for discontinuation in both treatment groups was rash (atovaquone, 4%; sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, 8%).  In studies comparing intravenous pentamidine and atovaquone, 63% of patients in the atovaquone group and 72% of patients in the pentamidine group reported side effects.  Treatment was discontinued in 7% of the atovaquone patients and 41% of the pentamidine patients due to adverse events; the most common reasons were rash (4%) in the atovaquone group and hypoglycemia (11%) and vomiting (9%) in the pentamidine group.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Gastrointestinal side effects are among the most common and have included nausea (up to 40%), diarrhea (up to 42%), vomiting (up to 22%), abdominal pain (up to 21%), oral monilia (up to 10%), taste perversion (3%), and constipation (3%).  The incidence of side effects was higher in patients in PCP treatment studies than in prevention studies.  Seven percent of patients experience anorexia and 5% of patients experience dyspepsia, although these are difficult to attribute to the drug due to the serious underlying diseases in the patients who receive atovaquone (the active ingredient contained in Mepron)   Hyperamylasemia has been reported in 8% of patients.  Pancreatitis has also been reported during postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Dermatologic side effects have included rash (up to 46%), pruritus (greater than or equal to 10%), exfoliative dermatitis, photosensitivity, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.  Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and skin desquamation have been reported during postmarketing experience in patients receiving multiple drug treatment including atovaquone (the active ingredient contained in Mepron) <sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Hepatic side effects have included elevated ALT (greater than 5 times ULN, 6%), elevated AST (greater than 5 times ULN, 4%), elevated alkaline phosphatase (greater than 2.5 times ULN, up to 8%), and increased amylase (greater than 1.5 times ULN, up to 8%) in patients being treated for PCP.  Therapy was discontinued in 2% of patients receiving atovaquone (the active ingredient contained in Mepron) due to ALT/AST elevations, compared to 7% of patients being treated with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.  Hepatomegaly has also been reported.  Rarely, hepatitis and at least one case of fatal liver failure have been reported during postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p>Hematologic side effects have included anemia (up to 6%) and neutropenia (up to 5%), but may be due to underlying disease.  Methemoglobinemia and thrombocytopenia have also been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>Metabolic side effects have included hyponatremia (up to 10%), hyperglycemia (9%), and hypoglycemia (1%).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p>Other side effects have included fever (up to 40%), asthenia (up to 31%), flu syndrome (greater than or equal to 10%), pain (greater than or equal to 10%), infection (up to 22%), sweating (greater than or equal to 10%), and malaise, but some may be due to underlying disease.
