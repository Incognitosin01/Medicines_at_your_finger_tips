Hypersensitivity reactions with penicillin were more common and more serious with IV therapy but have also been reported with oral therapy.  An initial sensitizing exposure was required to stimulate the production of antigen-specific IgE before clinical manifestations of hypersensitivity are seen on the second exposure.  There are numerous "hidden" environmental or occupational exposures to penicillin including in utero exposure, breast milk exposure, and occupational exposure.</p><p></p><p>Immediate allergic reactions generally occurred within 20 minutes of use; accelerated immediate reactions have occurred 20 minutes to 48 hours after use.  Immediate anaphylactic reactions were very rare and generally occurred after parenteral therapy; however, a few cases of anaphylaxis have been reported after oral therapy.  Delayed allergic reactions to penicillin have been reported within 1 to 2 weeks after therapy was started.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Allergic reactions, immediate allergic reactions (ranged from urticaria, pruritus to angioneurotic edema, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, hypotension, vascular collapse, death), accelerated immediate allergic reaction (included urticaria, pruritus, fever; occasionally, laryngeal edema), delayed allergic reactions (manifestations included serum sickness-like symptoms, i.e., fever, malaise, urticaria, myalgia, arthralgia, abdominal pain, various skin rashes [ranging from maculopapular eruptions to exfoliative dermatitis]), hypersensitivity myocarditis, eosinophilia, allergic vasculitis, asthenia, pain, reactions resembling serum sickness (including chills, fever, edema, arthralgia, prostration), anaphylaxis (severe and occasionally fatal)<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Contact dermatitis has been reported in those who prepared penicillin solutions.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Rash, urticaria, contact dermatitis</p><p></p><p>Beta-lactam antibiotics:</p><p>-Frequency not reported: Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [DRESS syndrome], acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis)<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms have been reported during or after antibacterial therapy.</p><p></p><p>Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, black or hairy tongue, and other symptoms of GI irritation have been reported, especially during oral therapy.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, black or hairy tongue, other symptoms of gastrointestinal (GI) irritation<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>Serious and even fatal electrolyte disturbances (i.e., hyperkalemia) have been reported with large IV doses since 1 million units of this drug contains 1.68 mEq of potassium ion.</p><p></p><p>Severe or fatal potassium poisoning has been reported in patients receiving continuous IV therapy in high doses (10 million to 100 million units/day), especially when renal insufficiency was present.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia), potassium poisoning (signs included hyperreflexia, convulsions, coma)<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Neurotoxic reactions have been reported after massive IV doses were administered and were more likely in patients with renal dysfunction.</p><p></p><p>Neuropathy, which was usually associated with high IV dosage, has been reported.</p><p></p><p>Severe neurologic reactions have been reported with high dose penicillin therapy or in patients with renal dysfunction; such reactions were most often seen with penicillin doses of 18 million to 80 million units daily.  Neurologic reactions occurred frequently in patients with renal dysfunction.  These reactions frequently abated after discontinuation of penicillin.  In several cases, penicillin was restarted at a lower dose with no further sequelae.  In 1 review, the authors found that cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) penicillin levels were higher in patients with seizures than in those without.  CSF penicillin levels ranged from 12 to 61 units/mL in the seizure group with the highest CSF levels, compared to 7.8 units/mL in the group without seizures.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Neurotoxic reactions (including hyperreflexia, myoclonic twitches, seizures, coma), neuropathy, severe neurologic reactions (including myoclonus, seizures, auditory and visual hallucinations, decreased mentation), neurovascular damage, headache, tremor, confusion, agitation, aseptic meningitis, coma<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Neutropenia, Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia, bleeding diathesis secondary to platelet dysfunction, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, anemia, leukopenia<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Neutropenia resolved after penicillin was discontinued.</p><p></p><p>Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia (an uncommon reaction) was reported in patients treated with greater than 10 million units/day of IV penicillin G and who previously received large doses of the drug.</p><p></p><p>A bleeding diathesis secondary to platelet dysfunction has been associated with large doses of penicillin.</p><p></p><p>Hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported and were usually associated with high IV dosage.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Local</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Injection site pain with IV administration, phlebitis, thrombophlebitis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Immunologic</h3><p>The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction has been reported during penicillin therapy in patients with syphilis or other spirochaetal infections.
