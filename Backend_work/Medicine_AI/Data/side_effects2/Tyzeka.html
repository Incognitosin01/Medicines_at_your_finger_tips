The most common side effects included grade 3 or 4 creatine phosphokinase elevations, fatigue, headache, and nausea.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Musculoskeletal</h3><p>CPK elevations greater than 7 times the upper limit of normal (7 x ULN) was reported in 13% of patients.</p><p></p><p>In clinical trials, increased CPK occurred more often during treatment with this drug.  By 104 weeks of therapy, 79% of patients using this drug (compared to 47% of patients using lamivudine) reported grade 1 to 4 CPK elevations; 13% of patients using this drug (compared to 4% of patients using lamivudine) reported grade 3 or 4 CPK elevations.  Most patients with CPK elevations did not exhibit symptoms, but the average recovery time was longer with this drug than with lamivudine.

By 208 weeks of therapy, 16% of patients using this drug reported grade 3 or 4 CPK elevations, most of which were asymptomatic (74% of patients had no muscle-related side effect), transient (98% lasted 1 or 2 visits), and resolved spontaneously or returned to baseline levels (93%).</p><p></p><p>Muscle-related symptoms (2%) included back pain, fibromyalgia, muscle cramp, musculoskeletal chest pain, myalgia, myopathy (including myositis), pain, pain in extremity, and tenderness.</p><p></p><p>Myopathy/myositis (presenting with muscular weakness) was diagnosed in less than 1% of patients.
