Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue lamivudine and are co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing ProductsEpivir® tablets and oral solution (used to treat HIV-1 infection) contain a higher dose of the active ingredient (lamivudine) than Epivir-HBV® tablets and oral solution (used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection). Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms appropriate for treatment of HIV-1.</p><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet; Solution)</p><p>Epivir-HBV®Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy (including lamivudine). Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.Lamivudine is not approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection because the lamivudine dosage in this formulation is subtherapeutic and monotherapy is inappropriate for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 resistance may emerge in chronic hepatitis B-infected patients with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection. HIV counseling and testing should be offered to all patients before beginning treatment with lamivudine and periodically during treatment.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, lamivudine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>
