They have included diarrhea (45%) vs. placebo (3%), cramping (38%) vs. placebo (0%), nausea (30%) vs. placebo (8%), constipation (25%) vs. placebo (14%), heartburn (17%) vs. placebo (6%), and epigastric discomfort (16%) vs. placebo (11%).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Constipation may be relieved by administering docusate sodium 100 mg to 200 mg per day in addition to increasing the intake of oral fluids, such as water.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p>Iron overload (i.e., hemosiderosis) has been reported in patients genetically predisposed, or have underlying disorders, that augment the absorption of iron.  It has also occurred following administration of excessive parenteral iron therapy, combination of oral and parenteral iron, or in patients with hemoglobinopathies that were erroneously diagnosed as iron deficiency anemia.  Hemosiderosis is treated with repeated phlebotomy or long-term administration of deferoxamine.  The liver is particularly susceptible to toxicity in iron-overload states.</p><p></p><p>Stained teeth have been reported primarily following ingestion of iron liquid preparations.  Liquid dosage forms should be diluted in juice or water and sipped through a straw to aid in prevention of staining.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Other side effects have included iron overload (hemosiderosis) and stained teeth.  Secondary hemochromatosis due to prolonged iron ingestion has been reported rarely.  An unpleasant taste following carbonyl iron ingestion has been reported in 40% to 70% of patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Nervous system side effects have included headache (29%) vs. placebo (25%), and weakness (11%) vs placebo (9%).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1.
