Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of nalbuphine or following a dose increase. Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of nalbuphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, nalbuphine (the active ingredient contained in Nubain) may cause some unwanted effects.
