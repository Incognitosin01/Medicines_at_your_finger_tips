This patient had been receiving this drug for 3.5 years before this reaction occurred.  The reaction (difficulty breathing, nausea, periorbital edema, and dizziness) occurred approximately 1 minute after injection and resolved without medical treatment.  This patient continued on therapy with premedication and eventually continued treatment without premedication.</p><p></p><p>Hypersensitivity reactions including nausea/vomiting, fever, headache, flushing, irritability, rigor/chills, skin erythema, rash, pruritus, and oral hypoesthesia have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Local</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Injection site reactions (63%), lipodystrophy (28%)<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Localized lipodystrophy, including lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy, has been reported after several months.
