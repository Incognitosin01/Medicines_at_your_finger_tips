<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Cholelithiasis</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Transaminase increased, gallstones<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Ten patients, five with single enzyme defect (SED) and 5 with peroxisomal disorders (PD) experienced worsening transaminases, elevated bilirubin values, or worsening cholestasis on liver biopsy during treatment.  Of these 10 patients, five (3 SED and 2 PD) had liver impairment at baseline while the other 5 did not have baseline cholestasis, but experienced exacerbation of liver disease while on treatment.  Exacerbation by this drug could not be ruled out.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Deaths attributed to progression of underlying liver disease were reported in 5 patients aged 1 year or less in trial 1 (SED, n=50; PD, n=29); three patients had AKR1D1 deficiency, 1 had 3beta-HSD and 1 had CYP7A1 deficiency.  Of the 29 patients in trial 1 with PDs including Zellweger spectrum disorders, 12 patients aged 7 months to 2.5 years died; 8 of the 12 deaths were attributed to progression of underlying liver disease or a worsening of their primary illness.  Two additional deaths in trial 1 were both patients who had been off study medication for more than 1 year; their deaths were most likely due to a progression of their underlying liver disease.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>In trial 2 (SED, n=31; PD, n=12) 2 patients with SED died; cause of death was unrelated to their primary treatment or progression of their underlying liver disease.  Four patients between the ages of 4 and 8 years with PD died (1 new patient and 3 who rolled over from trial 1); cause of death in 3 of these 4 patients was attributed to progression of underlying liver disease or worsening of their primary illness.  </p>

<p>One patient with 3 beta-HSD deficiency developed symptomatic cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy.  </p>
