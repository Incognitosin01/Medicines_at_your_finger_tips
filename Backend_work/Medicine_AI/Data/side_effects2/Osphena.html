Some of the dosage forms listed on this page <em>may not</em> apply to the brand name Osphena.</p><h2>In Summary</h2><p><b>More frequent side effects include:</b> endometrial hyperplasia and hot flash.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to ospemifene: oral tablet</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet)</p><p>Endometrial CancerOspemifene is an estrogen agonist/antagonist with tissue selective effects. In the endometrium, ospemifene has estrogen agonistic effects. There is a potential increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed and random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.Cardiovascular DisordersIn the clinical trials for ospemifene (duration of treatment up to 15 months) the incidence rates of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic stroke were 1.13 and 3.39 per thousand women years, respectively in the ospemifene 60 mg treatment group and 3.15 and 0 with placebo. The incidence of DVT was 2.26 per thousand women years (2 reported cases) in the ospemifene 60 mg treatment group and 3.15 per thousand women years (1 reported case) with placebo. Ospemifene should be prescribed for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.There is a reported increased risk of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) who received daily oral conjugated estrogens (CE) [0.625 mg]-alone therapy over 7.1 years as a part of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, ospemifene (the active ingredient contained in Osphena) may cause some unwanted effects.
