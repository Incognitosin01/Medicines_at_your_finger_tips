The risk of the intravenous form is higher (2%) than the oral form (1%) immediately following CABG surgery.</p><p></p><p>Studies to evaluate valdecoxib's long-term cardiovascular safety profile in patients with arthritis are being planned by the makers of the drug.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Nervous side effects have included headache and dizziness.
