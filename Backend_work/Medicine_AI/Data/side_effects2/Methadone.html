<li>FAQ</li></ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to methadone: oral solution, oral tablet, oral tablet for suspension</i></p><p>Other dosage forms:</p><ul><li>injection solution</li></ul><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet for Suspension)</p><p>Deaths due to too-rapid titration, drug interactions, or cardiac and respiratory side effects have occurred with methadone use for opioid dependence. Respiratory depression is the main hazard associated with methadone administration. QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmias (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. Only approved hospitals and pharmacies can dispense oral methadone for the treatment of narcotic addiction.</p><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet; Solution)</p><p> Methadone hydrochloride tablets expose patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient’s risk prior to prescribing methadone hydrochloride tablets, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions.</p><p> Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of methadone hydrochloride tablets. The peak respiratory depressant effect of methadone occurs later, and persists longer than the peak analgesic effect, especially during the initial dosing period or following a dose increase. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of methadone hydrochloride tablets or following a dose increase. Proper dosing and titration are essential and methadone hydrochloride should only be prescribed by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of methadone for toxification and maintenance treatment of opioid addiction.</p><p> Accidental ingestion of even one dose of methadone hydrochloride tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of methadone.Life-Threatening QT Prolongation: QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have occurred during treatment with methadone. Most cases involve patients being treated for pain with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. Closely monitor patients with risk factors for development of prolonged QT interval, a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, and those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction for changes in cardiac rhythm during initiation and titration of methadone hydrochloride tablets </p><p> Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of use of methadone hydrochloride tablets during pregnancy. NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. The balance between the risks of NOWS and the benefits of maternal methadone hydrochloride use may differ based on the risks associated with the mother’s underlying condition, pain, or addiction. Advise the patient of the risk of NOWS so that appropriate planning for management of the neonate can occur.Cytochrome P450 InteractionThe concomitant use of methadone hydrochloride tablets with all cytochrome P450 3A4, 2B6, 2C19, 2C9 or 2D6 inhibitors may result in an increase in methadone plasma concentrations, which could cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4, 2B6, 2C19, or 2C9 inducers may also result in an increase in methadone plasma concentration. Follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation, and consider dosage reduction with any changes of concomitant medications that can result in an increase in methadone levels.</p><p> Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.Reserve concomitant prescribing of methadone and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required.Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If the patient is visibly sedated, evaluate the cause of sedation, and consider delaying or omitting the daily methadone dose.Conditions For Distribution And Use Of Methadone Products For The Treatment Of Opioid Addiction:For detoxification and maintenance of opioid dependence, methadone should be administered in accordance with the treatment standards cited in 42 CFR Section 8, including limitations on unsupervised administration.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, methadone may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>
