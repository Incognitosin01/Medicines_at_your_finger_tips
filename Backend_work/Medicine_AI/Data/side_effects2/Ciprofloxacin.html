<li>Professional</li>
<li>FAQ</li></ul><h2>In Summary</h2><p><b>Commonly reported side effects of ciprofloxacin include:</b> pyelonephritis, arthralgia, and musculoskeletal signs and symptoms. <b>Other side effects include:</b> myalgia, and pain.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to ciprofloxacin: oral powder for suspension, oral tablet</i></p><p>Other dosage forms:</p><ul><li>intravenous solution</li></ul><h3>Warning</h3><p>Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, are associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions that have occurred together, including tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and CNS effects. Discontinue ciprofloxacin and avoid use of fluoroquinolones in patients with these serious adverse reactions. Reserve use of ciprofloxacin for patients with no alternative treatment options for an uncomplicated UTI. Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis.</p><p><b>Increased Risk of Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection After Fluoroquinolone Intake.</b>
Systemic and inhaled fluoroquinolones may be associated with an increased risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection (especially in older patients).
Conditions predisposing to aortic aneurysm and dissection include: family history of aneurysm disease, preexisting aortic aneurysm and/or aortic dissection, other risk factors/conditions (e.g., Marfan syndrome, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, Behcet's disease, hypertension, known atherosclerosis/peripheral atherosclerotic vascular diseases, elderly).
<b>Recommendations:</b><br/>
Use fluoroquinolones in patients at risk for aortic aneurysm and dissection only after careful benefit/risk assessment and after other therapeutic options have been considered.
Avoid prescribing fluoroquinolones to patients with/at risk for aortic aneurysm; prescribe fluoroquinolones to such patients only when no other treatment options are available.
Advise patients to seek medical attention in an emergency department immediately if sudden-onset severe abdominal, chest, or back pain occurs; stop therapy at once if patient reports symptoms suggestive of aortic aneurysm or dissection.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, ciprofloxacin may cause some unwanted effects.

<p>A 27-year-old woman with mild systemic erythematosus developed toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) after starting a second oral course of this drug after a prior 5-day course.  She developed a rash, high fever, and diarrhea after taking the 2nd dose and presented with diffuse rash, epidermal sloughing of 60% of the skin, desquamation of the lips, shock, and respiratory distress.  She died on the 28th hospital day of TEN, right ventricular failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

<p></p>
<p>Injection site irritation and induration have been reported with IV infusion time 30 minutes or less (instead of the recommended 1 hour) or when a small vein in the back of the hand was used.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Musculoskeletal</h3><p>Arthropathy has primarily been a concern in pediatric patients; however, at least 1 case was described in an adult cystic fibrosis patient receiving this drug.  Although cystic fibrosis arthropathy and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy typically occur in 7% to 8% of cystic fibrosis adults and adolescents, the arthropathy exhibited in this patient did not resemble either.  Several elements in its presentation strongly supported the diagnosis of ciprofloxacin-induced arthropathy, such as: a consistent time of onset with other reported cases of suspected quinolone-induced arthropathy (usually 3 weeks after starting therapy); a lack of history of arthralgia in the patient; reoccurrence upon rechallenge; and resolution of symptoms upon discontinuation of therapy (usually 2 weeks after therapy stopped).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tendinitis with subsequent tendon rupture has been documented in numerous case reports.  One patient with chronic renal failure developed bilateral Achilles tendon rupture after 4 days of ciprofloxacin therapy.  Although renal transplant patients and those with end-stage renal disease tend to have an increased risk of Achilles tendinitis and rupture over the general population, quinolone use has been shown to further increase that risk (12% in quinolone-treated patients versus 7% in nonquinolone-treated patients).</p>
<p></p>
<p>As of October 1994, 25 cases of Achilles tendon rupture had been reported to the US FDA.  Some ruptures have also occurred in the hand or shoulder.  Other risk factors identified included age and corticosteroid use.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There had been 23 reports of tendinitis submitted to the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Committee (ADRAC) between 2006 and 2008, including reports of Achilles tendinitis, tendon rupture, and tendon pain and swelling.  The reports were primarily in male patients (15 cases) older than 56 years who used this drug for 2 to 14 days.  In 19 of the reported cases, a fluoroquinolone (generally ciprofloxacin) was the primary suspect; however, details of concomitant serious medical conditions were not documented in most of the reports.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Musculoskeletal side effects reported in pediatric patients included arthralgia, abnormal gait, abnormal joint exam, joint sprains, leg pain, back pain, arthrosis, bone pain, pain, myalgia, arm pain, and decreased range of motion in a joint (knee, elbow, ankle, hip, wrist, shoulder).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Myalgia, tendinitis, and tendon rupture have also been reported during postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Musculoskeletal pain (e.g., extremity pain, back pain, chest pain), arthralgia</p>

<p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Tendinitis, muscular weakness</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Arthropathy (including suspected reversible cases), joint stiffness, elevated serum creatine phosphokinase, abnormal joint exam, joint sprains, arthrosis, bone pain, decreased range of motion in a joint (knee, elbow, ankle, hip, wrist, shoulder), jaw pain, neck pain, gout flare-up, joint swelling, muscle spasms, night cramps, knee inflammation</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Myoclonus, myasthenia, twitching<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Torsade de pointes was reported mainly in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation.</p>

Although cystic fibrosis arthropathy and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy typically occur in 7% to 8% of cystic fibrosis adults and adolescents, the arthropathy exhibited in this patient did not resemble either.  Several elements in its presentation strongly supported the diagnosis of ciprofloxacin-induced arthropathy, such as: a consistent time of onset with other reported cases of suspected quinolone-induced arthropathy (usually 3 weeks after starting therapy); a lack of history of arthralgia in the patient; reoccurrence upon rechallenge; and resolution of symptoms upon discontinuation of therapy (usually 2 weeks after therapy stopped).</p><p></p><p>Tendinitis with subsequent tendon rupture has been documented in numerous case reports.  One patient with chronic renal failure developed bilateral Achilles tendon rupture after 4 days of ciprofloxacin therapy.  Although renal transplant patients and those with end-stage renal disease tend to have an increased risk of Achilles tendinitis and rupture over the general population, quinolone use has been shown to further increase that risk (12% in quinolone-treated patients versus 7% in nonquinolone-treated patients).</p><p></p><p>As of October 1994, 25 cases of Achilles tendon rupture had been reported to the US FDA.  Some ruptures have also occurred in the hand or shoulder.  Other risk factors identified included age and corticosteroid use.</p><p></p><p>There had been 23 reports of tendinitis submitted to the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Committee (ADRAC) between 2006 and 2008, including reports of Achilles tendinitis, tendon rupture, and tendon pain and swelling.  The reports were primarily in male patients (15 cases) older than 56 years who used this drug for 2 to 14 days.  In 19 of the reported cases, a fluoroquinolone (generally ciprofloxacin) was the primary suspect; however, details of concomitant serious medical conditions were not documented in most of the reports.</p><p></p><p>Musculoskeletal side effects reported in pediatric patients included arthralgia, abnormal gait, abnormal joint exam, joint sprains, leg pain, back pain, arthrosis, bone pain, pain, myalgia, arm pain, and decreased range of motion in a joint (knee, elbow, ankle, hip, wrist, shoulder).</p><p></p><p>Myalgia, tendinitis, and tendon rupture have also been reported during postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Musculoskeletal pain (e.g., extremity pain, back pain, chest pain), arthralgia</p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Myalgia, arthritis, increased muscle tone and cramping, tendon rupture (mainly Achilles tendon)</p><p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Tendinitis, muscular weakness</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Arthropathy (including suspected reversible cases), joint stiffness, elevated serum creatine phosphokinase, abnormal joint exam, joint sprains, arthrosis, bone pain, decreased range of motion in a joint (knee, elbow, ankle, hip, wrist, shoulder), jaw pain, neck pain, gout flare-up, joint swelling, muscle spasms, night cramps, knee inflammation</p><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Myoclonus, myasthenia, twitching<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Torsade de pointes was reported mainly in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation.</p><p></p><p>Vasculitis has also been reported during postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Tachycardia, vasodilatation, hypotension</p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Vasculitis</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Angina pectoris, cardiopulmonary arrest, myocardial infarction, hypertension, palpitation, bradycardia, arrhythmia, atrial flutter, cardiac murmur, cardiovascular collapse, ventricular ectopy, ventricular bigeminy, abdominal aortic bruit, postural hypotension</p><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: QT prolongation/ECG QT prolonged, torsade de pointes, ventricular arrhythmia<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Candida infections, mycotic superinfections, pain, fever, malaise/feeling unwell, asthenia, edema</p><p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Gait disturbance/abnormal gait</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Irritability, flushing, thirst, elevated serum calcium, elevated serum potassium, elevated triglycerides, decreased serum albumin, decreased serum potassium, decreased total serum protein, elevated serum theophylline, serum phenytoin altered, chills, swelling, breast pain, achiness, weakness, fatigue, suprapubic pain, rigors, tenderness, fungal infection, increased body temperature</p><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Elevated serum cholesterol<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Elevated serum theophylline has been reported in patients receiving theophylline concomitantly.</p><p></p><p>Gait disturbance and elevated serum potassium have also been reported during postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>Quinolone class antibiotics have been associated with symptomatic hypoglycemia.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Elevated blood alkaline phosphatase, decreased appetite/anorexia, decreased food intake</p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Elevated LDH, elevated uric acid, elevated blood glucose, decreased uric acid, decreased blood glucose, acidosis, symptomatic hypoglycemia<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Renal impairment, renal failure</p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Tubulointerstitial nephritis</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Elevated serum creatinine, renal calculi, elevated BUN, decreased BUN, abnormal kidney function, allergic interstitial nephritis, nephritis, myoglobin-associated acute kidney injury/failure<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Allergic interstitial nephritis resulting in nonoliguric renal failure has been described in numerous case reports.
