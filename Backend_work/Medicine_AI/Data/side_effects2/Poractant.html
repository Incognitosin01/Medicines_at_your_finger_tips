Other complications of prematurity, including the following disorders directly related to illness severity and use of mechanical ventilation necessary for reoxygenation, may also occur: Pneumothorax, interstitial pulmonary emphysema and pulmonary hemorrhage.  The prolonged use of high concentrations of oxygen and mechanical ventilation are associated with the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1.
