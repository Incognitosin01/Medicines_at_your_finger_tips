Following completion of clinical trials, 3 additional cases of pancreatitis were reported.  Postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatalities, have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Empagliflozin:</p>

<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Rash, bullous pemphigoid<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitors.  Discontinuation of therapy and treatment with topical or systemic immunosuppressive agents led to resolution in reported cases.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>Empagliflozin-Linagliptin:</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Hypoglycemia, increased cholesterol, thirst</p>
<p></p>
<p>Empagliflozin:</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, dyslipidemia</p>
<p>Rare (Less than 0.1%): Ketoacidosis</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis, ketoacidosis, or ketosis	</p>
<p></p>
<p>Linagliptin:</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Increased uric acid<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>When this combination product was added to metformin therapy, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% and 3.6% in patients receiving empagliflozin 10 mg-linagliptin 5 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg-linagliptin 5 mg, respectively.  There were no reports of serious hypoglycemia.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Twenty reports of acidosis have been identified in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database during the period March 2013 through 06 June 2014.  All patients required emergency room treatment or hospitalization.  These cases were not typical of ketoacidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in that they occurred in patients with type 2 diabetes and their blood sugar levels were only slightly increased.  Some factors identified as potentially triggering the acidosis included major illness, reduced food and fluid intake, and reduced insulin dose.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Genitourinary</h3><p>Empagliflozin-Linagliptin:</p>
<p>Very Common (10% or more): Urinary tract infection (up to 12.5%)</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Urosepsis, pyelonephritis</p>
<p></p>
<p>Empagliflozin:</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Urinary tract infection, female genital mycotic infections, vaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis, increased urination, male genital mycotic infections</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Dysuria</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Fournier's gangrene<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>In the 5 years (2013 to 2018) since SGLT2 inhibitor approval, 12 cases of Fournier's gangrene have been reported.  Reports were almost equal in men and women (men=7; women=5), ages ranged from 38 to 78 years, and the average time to onset after starting an SGLT2 inhibitor was 9.2 months (range 7 days to 25 months).  All SGLT2 inhibitor drugs except ertugliflozin were included in the reports.  Ertugliflozin being the most recently approved agent, is expected to have the same risk, but insufficient patient use to assess risk.  All patients were hospitalized, all required surgery, all required surgical debridement, 5 required more than 1 surgery and 1 required skin grafting.  Four cases were complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, and septic shock, leading to prolonged hospitalization, and death in 1 case.  In the general population, Fournier's gangrene occurs in about 1.6 out of 100,000 males annually, with the highest incidence in men 50 to 79 years.  Since diabetes is a risk factor for Fournier's gangrene, a review of the FAERS database for the last 34 years was done and only 6 cases (all males, median age 57 years) were found with several other classes of antidiabetic drugs.  Findings with SGLT2 inhibitors appear to show an association over a shorter time frame and involve both males and females.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Empagliflozin-linagliptin:</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Hypersensitivity</p>
<p></p>
<p>Linagliptin:</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, angioedema, localized skin exfoliation, or bronchial hyper-reactivity</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Postmarketing, serious hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and exfoliative skin conditions have been reported in patients treated with linagliptin.  These reactions have occurred within the first 3 months and some have occurred after the first dose.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p>Postmarketing reports of AKI, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, have been received for patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors including empagliflozin.  Some reports involved patients younger than 65 years old.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Empagliflozin:</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Increased serum creatinine, decreased eGFR</p>

Each case involved the use of 1 or more dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.  In all cases, substantial reduction in prior activity level was reported, 10 patients were hospitalized due to disabling joint pain.  In 22 cases, symptoms appeared within 1 month of starting therapy, in 23 cases symptoms resolved less than 1 month after discontinuation.  A positive rechallenge was reported in 8 cases, with 6 cases involving use of a different DPP-4 inhibitor.  Sitagliptin had the greatest number of cases reported (n=28) followed by saxagliptin (n=5), linagliptin (n=2), alogliptin (n=1), and vildagliptin (n=2).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors:</p>
