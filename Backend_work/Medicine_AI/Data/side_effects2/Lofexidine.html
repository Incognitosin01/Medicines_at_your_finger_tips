With a mean dose of 2.16 mg/day, insomnia, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and hypotension, were reported at 51%, 29%, 24%, and 30%, respectively.

<p></p>
<p>Blood pressure (BP) elevations of 140 mmHg (systolic) or higher, and above the subject's pretreatment BP, occurred in 39.7% (n= 23/58) of patients following discontinuation of a 5-day course of 2.88 mg/day.  BP peaked on the second day after discontinuation.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Since market introduction (1992 in UK), there has been 1 case of QT prolongation, bradycardia, torsades de pointes, and cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation; there have been 3 reports of clinically significant QT prolongation in patients concomitantly receiving methadone.  </p>

<p>Cardiac electrophysiology studies with single doses of 1.44 to 1.8 mg produced maximum mean change from baseline QTcF of 14.4 and 13.6 milliseconds, respectively in healthy normal volunteers.  In a phase 3 study in opioid-dependent subjects, a maximal mean prolongation of the QTcF interval of 7.3 and 9.3 milliseconds occurred at doses of 2.16 and 2.88 mg/day respectively.
