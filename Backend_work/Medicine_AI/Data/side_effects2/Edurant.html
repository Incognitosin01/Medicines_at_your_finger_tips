<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to rilpivirine: oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>Most side effects occurred in the first 48 weeks of therapy.  The most common side effects (at least moderate severity) were depression, headache, insomnia, increased transaminases, and rash.  This drug was discontinued due to side effects in 2% of patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Increased ALT (grade 1: 18%; grade 2: 5%; grade 3: 1%; grade 4: 1%), AST (grade 1: 16%; grade 2: 4%; grade 3: 2%; grade 4: 1%), and total bilirubin (grade 1: 5%; grade 2: 3%; grade 3: 1%) have been reported.</p>

<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Anxiety<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Psychiatric disorders were the most common side effects leading to treatment discontinuation.  In the phase 3 clinical trials, ten patients (1%), discontinued this drug due to psychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>During phase 3 trials through 96 weeks, depressive disorders (regardless of causality, severity) were reported in 9% of patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Headache, dizziness</p>

<p></p>
<p>During phase 3 trials, an increase in serum creatinine was seen over 96 weeks of therapy.  Most of this increase occurred within the first 4 weeks of therapy, with a mean change of 0.1 mg/dL (range: -0.3 to 0.6 mg/dL) observed after 96 weeks of therapy.  In subjects with mild or moderate baseline renal dysfunction, the serum creatinine increase observed was similar to that seen in subjects with normal renal function.  These changes were not considered clinically relevant and no subject discontinued therapy due to increases in serum creatinine.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Fatigue<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Decreased white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, decreased platelet count<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Immunologic</h3><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Immune reconstitution/reactivation syndrome</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Autoimmune disorders in the setting of immune reconstitution (e.g., Graves' disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barre syndrome)<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Endocrine</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Decreased basal cortisol, decreased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated cortisol levels, adrenal insufficiency, abnormal 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>In the pooled phase 3 trials, at week 96, there was an overall mean change from baseline in basal cortisol of -19.1 nmol/L (-0.69 mcg/dL) in the rilpivirine group, and of -0.6 nmol/L (-0.02 mcg/dL) in the efavirenz group.  At week 96, the mean change from baseline in ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels was lower in the rilpivirine group (+18.4 nmol/L) than in the efavirenz group (+54.1 nmol/L).  Mean values for both basal and ACTH-stimulated cortisol values at week 96 were within the normal range.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the rilpivirine group, 43 of 588 patients with normal 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test at baseline developed abnormal 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test (peak cortisol level less than 18.1 mcg/dL) during the trial versus 18 of 561 patients in the efavirenz group.  Abnormal 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test at week 96 was seen in 14 of the 43 rilpivirine patients and 9 of the 18 efavirenz patients.  Clinical significance of abnormal 250 mcg ACTH stimulation tests (or the higher rate in the rilpivirine group) has not been established.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Overall, there were no serious side effects, deaths, or treatment discontinuations that could clearly be attributed to adrenal insufficiency.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><div class="referenceList"><h4 id="refs">References</h4><p id="ref_1">1.
