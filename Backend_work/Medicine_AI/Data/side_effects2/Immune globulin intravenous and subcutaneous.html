        Warning

<li>The chance of blood clots may be raised with this drug. The chance may be higher in older people, if you have to be in a bed or chair for
        a long time, if you take estrogen products, or if you have certain catheters. Some health problems like thick blood, heart problems, or a
        history of blood clots raise the chance of having blood clots. Blood clots can happen if you do not have any of these health problems. Call
        your doctor right away if you have numbness or weakness on 1 side of your body; pain, redness, tenderness, warmth, or swelling in the arms or
        legs; change in color of an arm or leg; chest pain or pressure; shortness of breath; fast heartbeat; or coughing up blood. Talk with your
        doctor.
        </li>
<li>Kidney problems have happened with human immune globulin. Sometimes, these problems have been deadly. Kidney problems are more common in
        people using products that have sucrose. Most immune globulin products do not have sucrose. The chance of these problems may be raised if you
        have kidney problems, high blood sugar (diabetes), fluid loss (dehydration) or low blood volume, a blood infection, or proteins in the blood
        that are not normal. The chance may be raised if you are 65 or older, or if you take other drugs that may harm the kidneys. Talk with your
        doctor if you have questions about this information or about if your product has sucrose.
        </li>
<li>You will need to be sure that you are not dehydrated before getting this drug. Check with your doctor to see if you need to drink extra
        fluids before getting this drug.
