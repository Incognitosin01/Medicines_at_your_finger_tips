<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Back pain</p><p>During clinical trials, bone loss was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).  One study showed the percent of subjects with greater than an 8% decrease in bone mineral density in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck at any point compared to placebo was 2% and 7% in patients dosed with 150 mg/day and 200 mg twice a day, respectively (placebo: less than 1%).  In the blinded extension study in which patients continued treatment for 12 months, these numbers increased to 8% and 21%.  In study 2, the percent of subjects with greater than an 8% decrease in BMD was less than 1%, 6%, and 0% in patients dosed with 150 mg/day, 200 mg twice a day, and placebo, respectively.
