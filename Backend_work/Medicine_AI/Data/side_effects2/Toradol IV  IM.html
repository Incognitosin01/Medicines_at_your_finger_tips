For patients receiving the nasal spray, nasal discomfort, rhinalgia, increased lacrimation, throat irritation, and rhinitis were reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>A large postmarketing observational study (n=10,000) revealed the incidence of clinically serious gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was dose dependent and more than double in patients 65 years or older.

<p></p>
<p>In pediatric patients, an increased risk of bleeding was observed following tonsillectomy.  In a retrospective analysis, risk of bleeding following a tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy was 10.1% in patients receiving this drug compared with 2.2% in those receiving opioids.  The postoperative hemorrhage rate in patients 12 years and younger was 6.5% with ketorolac treatment versus 3.3% without.  In a prospective study in patients 3 to 9 years undergoing tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy, the overall incidence of bleeding in patients receiving this drug was 16.3% compared with 17% in children receiving morphine.  However, during the first 24 hours after surgery, bleeding was observed in 14.3% of the ketorolac group versus 4.2% of the morphine group.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Anemia, increased bleeding time</p>
