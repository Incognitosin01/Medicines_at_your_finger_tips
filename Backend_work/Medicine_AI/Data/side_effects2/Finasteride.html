<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to finasteride: oral tablet</i></p><h3>Genitourinary</h3><p>Two hundred fourteen reports of gynecomastia in men taking finasteride in the United States were received by the FDA between June 1992 and February 1995.  Among those reported, fifty eight percent were taking additional medications that have been associated with gynecomastia.  Sixty nine of 86 patients who discontinued finasteride treatment had partial or complete remission.</p>
<p></p>
<p>New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences have been reported to decrease with duration of therapy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Erectile dysfunction has been reported to continue beyond treatment discontinuation.  Normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after withdrawing finasteride treatment.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had comorbid conditions:</p>
<p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Impotence (up to 18.5%)</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Abnormal ejaculation, decreased ejaculatory volume, abnormal sexual function, gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, testicular pain, male infertility and/or poor seminal quality<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Endocrine</h3><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Breast tenderness, breast enlargement</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Reductions in prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels of approximately 50%<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Finasteride may cause a decrease in PSA levels in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia as well as in patients with prostate cancer.  In one study, mean PSA reductions of 50% were noted, regardless of baseline levels.  There was no indication that PSA levels were further suppressed in patients with prostate cancer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>PSA levels are commonly used in the screening process for prostate cancer.  Patients who develop sustained increases in PSA while on finasteride therapy should be carefully evaluated for medical causes as well as noncompliance.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Decreased libido, dizziness, somnolence</p>
