</ul><p><i>Applies to levamisole: oral tablet</i></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p>Hematologic toxicity primarily involves (sometimes fatal) agranulocytosis.  Leukopenia has been reported in 2% (over 4,000/mm3), 4% (2,000 to 4,000/mm3), and less than 1% (less than 2,000/mm3).  Transient granulocytopenia has been reported in up to 20% of treated patients.  Recovery is usually spontaneous.  In patients with thrombocytopenia, 1% of patients show platelet counts over 130,000/mm3, and 1% show platelet counts between 50,000 and 130,000/mm3.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>One analysis of 267 reports representing 6,217 patients, found that patients treated for rheumatic disorders (n=1131) reported a significantly higher rate of leukopenia and agranulocytosis (4.9%).  The majority of these patients (4.5%) discontinued therapy.  Leukopenia is usually not prodromal to agranulocytosis.</p><p></p><p>Reports show some indication that agranulocytosis is due to a type II reaction (Coombs' classification).  Management of levamisole-induced agranulocytosis includes early diagnosis, discontinuation of treatment, and prevention of infection.  Agranulocytosis is spontaneously reversible when treatment is discontinued.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>One analysis of 267 reports representing 6,217 patients, found that patients treated for rheumatic disorders (n=1131) reported a significantly high percentage of idiosyncratic or allergic reactions.  These included skin rash (14.8%).  Half of the patients experiencing skin rash discontinued therapy (7%).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Dermatologic side effects include dermatitis (8%), alopecia (3%), pruritus (1%) and urticaria (&lt;1%).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p>Fever may be a symptom of infection associated with agranulocytosis, but often it is not.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Flu-like symptoms including fatigue (6%), fever (3%), rigors (3%), myalgia, and malaise have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Gastrointestinal side effects include nausea (22%), diarrhea (13%), vomiting (6%), stomatitis (3%), anorexia (2%), abdominal pain (2%), and constipation (2%).  Flatulence and dyspepsia have also been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Cardiac dysfunction leading to edema (1%) and chest pain (&lt;1%) have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Musculoskeletal</h3><p>Musculoskeletal side effects including arthralgia (5%) and myalgia (3%) have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Nervous system side effects including dizziness (3%), headache (3%), paresthesia (2%), taste perversion (8%), and an altered sense of smell (1%) have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Psychiatric</h3><p>Psychiatric side effects including somnolence (3%), depression (1%), nervousness (1%), insomnia (1%), and anxiety (1%) have been reported.  Confusion, hallucinations, impaired concentration, nightmares, and an encephalopathy-like syndrome have also been reported.  A case has been reported of a psychotic episode which was believed to be caused by prolonged levamisole use.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Ocular</h3><p>Ocular side effects including blurred vision (1%) and conjunctivitis (&lt;1%) have been reported.  Periorbital edema has also been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Immunologic</h3><p>Infection (5%) has been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Hyperbilirubinemia and increased alkaline phosphatase have been reported rarely.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p>Renal failure and elevated serum creatinine have been reported rarely.  One case report of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone has been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p>Other adverse reactions including vaginal bleeding and anaphylaxis have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1.
