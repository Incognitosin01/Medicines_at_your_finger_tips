Some of the dosage forms listed on this page <em>may not</em> apply to the brand name Diprivan.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to propofol: parenteral injectable emulsion</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p><b>Special Alerts:</b></p><p><b>Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Propoven:</b>&lt;sup&gt;758&lt;/sup&gt;  On May 8, 2020, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) permitting the emergency use of the unapproved product, Fresenius Propoven 2% (propofol 20 mg/mL) Emulsion 100 mL, to maintain sedation via continuous infusion in patients older than 16 years of age who require mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because Fresenius Propoven 2% (propofol 20 mg/mL) Emulsion has a concentration twice that of the FDA-approved propofol product, there is a risk of unintentional overdose. There are also important differences in the formulation and labeling between the two products. Healthcare providers should review the EUA and the differences between the two products prior to administering Propoven. Documents related to the EUA can be found on the FDA website at [Web], including the most recent letter of authorization ([Web]), a fact sheet on the EUA for healthcare providers ([Web]), and a wall chart outlining the key differences between the two products ([Web]).</p><p><b>Temporary Policy on Repackaging or Combining Propofol Drug Products During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency:</b>&lt;sup&gt;756&lt;/sup&gt;  During the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA has received several inquiries from healthcare professionals concerning the unavailability of propofol drug products used in the treatment and management of patients with complications related to COVID-19. FDA is issuing this guidance to communicate its temporary policy regarding the repackaging or combining of propofol drug products by a licensed pharmacist in a State licensed pharmacy, a Federal facility, or an outsourcing facility registered pursuant to section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) (21 U.S.C. 353b) as outlined in this guidance for the duration of the public health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, or for such shorter time as FDA may announce through updated guidance. This policy is intended to remain in effect for no longer than the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by HHS, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)). FDA is continually assessing the needs and circumstances that make issuance of this guidance appropriate. As relevant needs and circumstances evolve, FDA intends to update, modify, or withdraw policies in this guidance as appropriate.
