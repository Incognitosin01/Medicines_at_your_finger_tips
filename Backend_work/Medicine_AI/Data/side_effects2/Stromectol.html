<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to ivermectin: compounding powder, oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>Ivermectin (the active ingredient contained in Stromectol) is well tolerated compared to other microfilaricidal agents (i.e., thiabendazole, diethylcarbamazine).  Adverse reactions (i.e., pruritus, fever, rash, myalgia, headache) occur commonly during the first 3 days after treatment and appear to be related to the extent of parasitic infection and systemic mobilization and killing of microfilariae.  The majority of reactions can usually be treated with aspirin, acetaminophen and/or antihistamines.  Adverse effects tend to occur with lesser frequency during periods of retreatment.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Ocular</h3><p>Ocular side effects have included eyelid edema, anterior uveitis, blurred vision, conjunctivitis, limbitis, punctate opacity, keratitis, abnormal sensation in the eyes, and chorioretinitis/choroiditis; however, these effects are also associated with the disease onchocerciasis.  Loss of vision has occurred rarely but usually resolved without corticosteroid treatment.  Conjunctival hemorrhage has been reported during postmarketing experience in patients treated for onchocerciasis.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p>Worsening of Mazzotti reactions, including arthralgia, synovitis, lymph node enlargement and tenderness, pruritus, skin involvement (including edema, papular and pustular or frank urticarial rash), and fever, has been reported during the first 4 days following treatment for onchocerciasis.</p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Nervous system side effects have included dizziness, headache, somnolence, vertigo, and tremor.  Serious or fatal encephalopathy has been reported rarely in patients with onchocerciases, and heavily infected with Loa loa, either spontaneously or after treatment with ivermectin (the active ingredient contained in Stromectol)   Seizures have been reported during postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Gastrointestinal side effects have included anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p>Other side effects have included asthenia, fatigue, abdominal pain, chest discomfort, facial edema, and peripheral edema.</p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p>Hematologic side effects have included decreased leukocyte count (3%), eosinophilia (3%), and increased hemoglobin (1%).  Hematomatous swellings associated with prolonged prothrombin times have been reported, but the clinical significance is unknown.  Leukopenia and anemia have been reported in at least one patient.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Hepatic side effects have included elevated ALT and/or AST.  Elevated liver enzymes, elevated bilirubin, and hepatitis have been reported during postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Cardiovascular side effects have included tachycardia and orthostatic hypotension.  EKG changes, including prolonged PR interval, flattened T waves and peaked T waves, have been reported in single cases.  Hypotension (primarily orthostatic hypotension) has been reported during postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Dermatologic side effects have included pruritus, rash, and urticaria.  Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported during postmarketing experience.</p><h3>Respiratory</h3><p>Respiratory side effects have included worsening bronchial asthma, laryngeal edema, and dyspnea.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Musculoskeletal</h3><p>Musculoskeletal side effects have included myalgia.</p><h3>Renal</h3><p>Renal side effects have included rare transient proteinuria.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><div class="referenceList"><h4 id="refs">References</h4><p id="ref_1">1.
