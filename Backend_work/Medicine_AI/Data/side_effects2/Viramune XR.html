Women, including pregnant women, or patients with higher CD4+ cell counts are at higher risk of hepatotoxicity. Permanently discontinue nevirapine following severe hepatic, skin, or hypersensitivity reactions. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash during the first 18 weeks of treatment. Monitor patients intensively during the first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine to detect potentially life-threatening hepatotoxicity or skin reactions. Extra vigilance is warranted during the first 6 weeks of therapy, which is the period of greatest risk for adverse events. Strictly follow the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, nevirapine (the active ingredient contained in Viramune XR) may cause some unwanted effects.

The most serious side effects have included hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and hypersensitivity reactions.  Hepatitis/hepatic failure have been isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which have included severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle/joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction.</p>

Rashes were usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the face, trunk, and extremities.  Rash has occurred most often during the first 6 weeks of therapy.  Utilization of the 14-day lead-in period with an immediate-release formulation has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash.</p>
