Tell your doctor or get medical help right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms that may be related to a very bad side effect:
</p><ul>
<li>Signs of an allergic reaction, like rash; hives; itching; red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin with or without fever; wheezing;
tightness in the chest or throat; trouble breathing, swallowing, or talking; unusual hoarseness; or swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue,
or throat.
</li>
<li>Signs of liver problems like dark urine, feeling tired, not hungry, upset stomach or stomach pain, light-colored stools, throwing up, or
yellow skin or eyes.
</li>
<li>Signs of a pancreas problem (pancreatitis) like very bad stomach pain, very bad back pain, or very bad upset stomach or throwing up.
</li>
<li>Chest pain or pressure or a fast heartbeat.
</li>
<li>Not able to pass urine or change in how much urine is passed.
</li>
<li>Fever, chills, or sore throat; any unexplained bruising or bleeding; or feeling very tired or weak.
</li>
<li>Throat irritation.
</li>
<li>Trouble swallowing.
</li>

</li>
<li>Change in skin color.
</li>
<li>Swollen gland.

<li>Diarrhea is common with antibiotics. Rarely, a severe form called C diffâ€“associated diarrhea (CDAD) may happen. Sometimes, this has led
to a deadly bowel problem (colitis). CDAD may happen during or a few months after taking antibiotics. Call your doctor right away if you have stomach pain, cramps, or very loose, watery, or bloody stools. Check with your doctor before treating diarrhea.
</li>
<li>Raised pressure in the brain has happened with this medicine (doxycycline tablets and capsules). Most of the time, this will go back to normal after this medicine (doxycycline tablets and capsules) is stopped. Sometimes, loss of eyesight may happen and may not go away even after this medicine (doxycycline tablets and capsules) is stopped. Call your doctor right away if you have a headache
or eyesight problems like blurred eyesight, seeing double, or loss of eyesight.
</li>
</ul><h3>What are some other doxycycline side effects?</h3><p>All drugs may cause side effects. However, many people have no side effects or only have minor side effects. Call your doctor or get medical
help if any of these side effects or any other side effects bother you or do not go away:</p><ul>
<li>Not hungry.
</li>

The patient also experienced memory dysfunction; she could not remember the events of the afternoon prior to the dose of this drug and could not retain the information after she was reminded.  The incident lasted about 30 minutes and she was transported to the hospital for further evaluation.  No further cause, such as intoxication or trauma, could be elicited.  Once at the hospital, the patient was able to remember the events of the afternoon and could retain new information, but amnesia regarding the events of the 30 minutes following the onset of the headache persisted.  The patient's laboratory results, computerized tomography scan, MRI scan, cerebrospinal fluid, and electroencephalogram showed no pathology.  When the patient was discharged 2 days later, the amnesia for the 30 minutes continued.  After elimination of other symptomatic causes, the amnesia was concluded to be due to this drug because of the close relation of the dose and the onset of symptoms.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Common cold (up to 22%), influenza symptoms (up to 11%)</p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Injury/accidental injury, pain, infection, fungal infection, influenza</p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Candida infection/candidiasis, flushing, retrosternal pain</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Malaise, overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms (superinfection)</p><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Asthenia<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Nausea (up to 13.4%)</p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Nausea/vomiting, toothache, tooth disorder, dyspepsia, diarrhea, periodontal abscess, acid indigestion, upper abdominal pain, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, stomach discomfort, dry mouth</p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Gum pain, heartburn/gastritis</p><p><b>Rare</b> (less than 0.1%): Glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, inflammatory lesions (with candidal/monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region, esophagitis, esophageal ulcerations, pancreatitis, pseudomembranous colitis, Clostridium difficile colitis, stomatitis</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, esophageal irritation, ulceration, epigastric burning, black hairy tongue, tooth discoloration/adult tooth staining, vomiting, enamel hypoplasia, staphylococcal enterocolitis</p><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Bloody diarrhea, colitis, constipation, superficial tooth discoloration<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Numerous cases of esophageal ulceration have been reported.
