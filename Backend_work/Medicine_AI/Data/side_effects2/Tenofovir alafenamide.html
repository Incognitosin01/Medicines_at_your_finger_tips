<p>During controlled clinical trials, the most common side effects reported with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) in HIV-1-infected patients included rash, diarrhea, headache, pain, depression, asthenia, and nausea.  The most common side effects associated with this drug in combination with other antiretrovirals have included mild to moderate gastrointestinal events (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and flatulence) in therapy-experienced patients and mild to moderate gastrointestinal events and dizziness in therapy-naive patients.  About 1% of patients in clinical trials discontinued therapy due to gastrointestinal side effects.</p>

<p></p>
<p>A confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL was reported in 9% of patients with chronic HBV and decompensated liver disease (n=45) using tenofovir DF; however, since tenofovir DF and decompensated liver disease may have an impact on renal function, the contribution of tenofovir DF to renal impairment in these patients was difficult to ascertain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after this drug was stopped; however, decreased CrCl did not completely resolve in some patients after stopping tenofovir DF.  Rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures), hypokalemia, muscular weakness, myopathy, and hypophosphatemia may occur as a result of proximal renal tubulopathy.</p>
