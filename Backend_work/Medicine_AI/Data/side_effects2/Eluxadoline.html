<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Sphincter of Oddi spasm, pancreatitis</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Gastroesophageal reflux disease</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Hospitalizations and deaths due to pancreatitis, particularly in patients without a gallbladder<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>As of February 2017, the US FDA has received 120 reports of serious pancreatitis or death associated with this drug; 76 of these patients were hospitalized and 2 died.  Both patients who died did not have a gallbladder; 56 of the 68 patients who reported gallbladder status did not have a gallbladder and had been receiving the recommended dose.  Also reported among these cases were 6 with sphincter of Oddi spasm and 16 with abdomen pain.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Sphincter of Oddi spasm occurred in 0.2% (n=807) and 0.8% (n=1032) of patients receiving 75 mg and 100 mg twice a day, respectively.  Sphincter of Oddi spasm manifested as abdominal pain with lipase elevation of less than 3 times the upper limit of normal in 1 patient, and elevated hepatic enzymes associated with abdominal pain in the second patient.  For the 8 patients taking 100 mg twice a day, sphincter of Oddi spasm manifested in 1 patient as pancreatitis and as elevated hepatic enzymes associated with abdominal pain in the other 7 patients.  Of 1317 patients with a gallbladder, no patients experienced a sphincter of Oddi spasm, while 2 of 165 patients and 8 of 184 patients in the 75 mg and 100 mg twice a day groups, respectively, experienced sphincter of Oddi spasm.  Onset of symptoms occurred within the first week in 80% (8 of 10) of patients and no cases occurred greater than 1 month after treatment onset.  The 1 case of sphincter of Oddi spasm-induced pancreatitis occurred within minutes of taking the first dose of the drug and resolved within 24 hours of discontinuation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pancreatitis not associated with sphincter of Oddi spasm was reported in 0.2% (n=807) and 0.3% (n=1032) of patients receiving 75 mg and 100 mg twice a day, respectively.  Of these 5 cases, 3 were associated with excessive alcohol intake, 1 with biliary sludge, and 1 was reported 2 weeks after the patient discontinued therapy.  All resolved within 1 week of therapy discontinuation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Constipation was the most commonly reported adverse event in clinical trials with 50% of case reported within the first 2 weeks, and the majority within the first 3 months.  Rates of severe constipation were less than 1%.  After 3 months, the incidence of constipation was similar across active treatment and placebo groups.  </p>
