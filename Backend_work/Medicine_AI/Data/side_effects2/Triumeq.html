Patients with HLA-B*5701 allele have a higher risk for abacavir-related hypersensitivity; screening for allele is recommended prior to initiating or reinitiation of therapy unless previous allele assessment is documented. Use is contraindicated in those with the HLA-B*5701 allele or with a previous hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients co-infected with HBV and HIV-1 who have discontinued lamivudine; monitor hepatic function closely for several months upon discontinuation of therapy; initiation of anti-HBV therapy may be needed.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine may cause some unwanted effects.

<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine: oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>The most common side effects were insomnia, headache, fatigue, nausea, and dizziness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many of the side effects listed occurred commonly in patients with abacavir hypersensitivity (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, lethargy, rash).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Hypersensitivity reactions were reported with abacavir and dolutegravir and shared some common features (e.g., fever and/or rash with other symptoms that indicated multi-organ involvement).  In general, time to onset was 10 to 14 days for both abacavir- and dolutegravir-associated reactions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with abacavir.  Such reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and usually occurred within the first 6 weeks of abacavir therapy; however, abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during therapy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Patients with the human leukocyte antigen subtype B*5701 (HLA-B*5701) allele are at higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; however, such reactions have occurred in patients without the HLA-B*5701 allele.  Abacavir hypersensitivity was reported in about 8% of patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where patients were not screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele; incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions was 1% in clinical trials where HLA-B*5701 carriers were excluded.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have been characterized by at least 2 of the following key signs/symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, pharyngitis).  Almost all reactions have included fever and/or rash (usually maculopapular or urticarial); however, reactions also reported without fever or rash.  Signs/symptoms reported in at least 10% of patients with hypersensitivity reaction have included rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, cough, fever, fatigue/lethargy, malaise, headache, elevated liver function tests, and myalgia.  Other signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity have included mouth ulceration, sore throat, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, edema, lymphadenopathy, hypotension, conjunctivitis, anaphylaxis, paresthesia, lymphopenia, hepatitis, liver failure, myolysis, arthralgia, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, renal failure, abnormal chest x-ray findings (mainly infiltrates, which were localized), and death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Symptoms of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction worsened with continued therapy and generally resolved when abacavir was discontinued.  Restarting abacavir after a hypersensitivity reaction has resulted in more severe symptoms within hours and included life-threatening hypotension and death.  Rarely, life-threatening reactions have occurred within hours after restarting abacavir in patients who stopped it for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity (or who stopped it with only 1 key symptom of hypersensitivity).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Hypersensitivity</p>

Meta-analysis of randomized, controlled clinical trials showed no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated patients as compared with control subjects.
