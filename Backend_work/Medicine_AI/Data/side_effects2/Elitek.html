Immediately and permanently discontinue rasburicase if a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs.Hemolysis: Do not administer rasburicase to patients with glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Immediately and permanently discontinue rasburicase if hemolysis occurs. Screen patients at higher risk for G6PD deficiency (e.g., patients of African or Mediterranean ancestry) prior to starting rasburicase therapy.Methemoglobinemia: Rasburicase can result in methemoglobinemia in some patients. Immediately and permanently discontinue rasburicase if methemoglobinemia occurs.Interference with uric acid measurements: Rasburicase enzymatically degrades uric acid in blood samples left at room temperature. Collect blood samples in pre-chilled tubes containing heparin and immediately immerse and maintain sample in an ice water bath. Assay plasma samples within 4 hours of collection.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, rasburicase (the active ingredient contained in Elitek) may cause some unwanted effects.
