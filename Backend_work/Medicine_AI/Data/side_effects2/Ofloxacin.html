Discontinue ofloxacin and avoid use of fluoroquinolones in patients with these serious adverse reactions. Reserve use of ofloxacin for patients with no alternative treatment options for acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis or uncomplicated cystitis. Fluoroquinolones, including ofloxacin, may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, ofloxacin may cause some unwanted effects.
