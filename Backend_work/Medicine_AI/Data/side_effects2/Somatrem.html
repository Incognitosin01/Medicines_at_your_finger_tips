</ul><p><i>Applies to somatrem: injectable powder for injection</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>Somatrem has been generally well tolerated with minimal adverse effects.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Oncologic</h3><p>Oncologic side effects have included rare reports of leukemia, however, the association with human growth hormone is uncertain.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Immunologic</h3><p>An IgG antibody has been identified. No antibodies to the IgE class has been detected.  Growth hormone antibody binding capacities less than 2 mg/L have not led to growth attenuation.  Testing for antibodies should be carried out in any patient failing to respond to treatment.</p><p></p><p>Primate studies have failed to reveal evidence of histopathological changes due to immune complex formation.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Immunologic side effects have included the rare development of persistent antibodies.  The development of antibodies may be greater with the use of somatrem than with somatropin, although the overall incidence is low.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Nervous system side effects have been infrequent, but have included headaches and weakness.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Endocrine</h3><p>Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone (PTH) may increase during treatment with somatrem.  The mechanism is unknown.  These potential changes should be considered when evaluating patient laboratory measurements.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Endocrine side effects have included mild hyperglycemia or gynecomastia.  Elevations in IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) and insulin levels occur consistently in adults.  Alterations in thyroid hormone metabolism may occur.  Recombinant human growth hormone may reveal diabetes mellitus in a patient, but is not the cause.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Edema occurs more often in adults, appears to be dose-related, and is due to the antinatriuretic effect of growth hormone.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Cardiovascular side effects have included mild, transient, peripheral edema in up to 2.5% of patients during early treatment with somatrem.  Intracranial hypertension is a rare effect that may present with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea and vomiting.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p>Athletes using human growth hormone for doping purposes may experience cardiac, renal, and splenic hypertrophy, cardiac myopathy, fluid retention, glucose intolerance, abnormal bone growth, and an increased risk of cancers.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Other side effects have included acromegaly following the chronic use of human growth hormone by athletes.  </p><p></p><p>There is no risk of acquiring Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from recombinant human growth hormone, as with the previously marketed pituitary-derived human growth hormone.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Dermatologic side effects have included rare reports of increased growth of preexisting nevi (hereditary malformation of the skin).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>Metabolic side effects have included lipolysis resulting in a statistically significant decrease in total body fat (14% to 20%) in adults.  Significant reductions in total cholesterol and/or LDL have been reported.  No changes in HDL have been observed.  Elderly patients have exhibited triglyceride elevations.  The long-term effect of recombinant human growth hormone on lipid metabolism is unknown.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Musculoskeletal</h3><p>Musculoskeletal side effects have rarely included localized muscle pain, carpal tunnel syndrome and slipped capital femoral epiphysis.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Local</h3><p>Localized side effects have included infrequent injection site pain in children.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1.
