The onset is often subtle and subtle and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms (eg, malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, abdominal pain). Risk factors include concomitant carbonic anhydrase inhibitor use (eg, topiramate), age 65 or older, surgery and other procedures, radiological study with contrast, hypoxic states, excessive alcohol consumption, or hepatic impairment.

<p>Twenty reports of acidosis have been identified in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database during the period March 2013 through 06 June 2014.  All patients required emergency room treatment or hospitalization.  These cases were not typical of ketoacidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in that they occurred in patients with type 2 diabetes and their blood sugar levels were only slightly increased.  Some factors identified as potentially triggering the acidosis included major illness, reduced food and fluid intake, and reduced insulin dose.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Dapagliflozin-Metformin: </p>

<p></p>
<p>In the 5 years (2013 to 2018) since SGLT2 inhibitor approval, 12 cases of Fournier's gangrene have been reported.  Reports were almost equal in men and women (men=7; women=5), ages ranged from 38 to 78 years, and the average time to onset after starting an SGLT2 inhibitor was 9.2 months (range 7 days to 25 months).  All SGLT2 inhibitor drugs except ertugliflozin were included in the reports.  Ertugliflozin being the most recently approved agent, is expected to have the same risk, but insufficient patient use to assess risk.  All patients were hospitalized, all required surgery, all required surgical debridement, 5 required more than 1 surgery and 1 required skin grafting.  Four cases were complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, and septic shock, leading to prolonged hospitalization, and death in 1 case.  In the general population, Fournier's gangrene occurs in about 1.6 out of 100,000 males annually, with the highest incidence in men 50 to 79 years.  Since diabetes is a risk factor for Fournier's gangrene, a review of the FAERS database for the last 34 years was done and only 6 cases (all males, median age 57 years) were found with several other classes of antidiabetic drugs.  Findings with SGLT2 inhibitors appear to show an association over a shorter time frame and involve both males and females.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Female genital mycotic infections (including vulvovaginal mycotic infection, vaginal infection, genital infection, vulvovaginitis, fungal genital infection, vulvovaginal candidiasis, vulval abscess, genital candidiasis, and vaginitis bacterial), urinary tract infections (including urinary tract infection cystitis, pyelonephritis, urethritis, and prostatitis), male genital mycotic infections (including balanitis, fungal genital infection, balanitis candida, genital candidiasis, balanoposthitis, balanoposthitis infective, genital infection, posthitis), increased urination, discomfort with urination</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Vulvovaginal pruritus</p>
