<li>FAQ</li></ul><p class="ddc-notification"><b>Note:</b> This document contains side effect information about dulaglutide. Some of the dosage forms listed on this page <em>may not</em> apply to the brand name Trulicity.</p><h2>In Summary</h2><p><b>Common side effects of Trulicity include:</b> diarrhea, frequent bowel movements, nausea, and retching. <b>Other side effects include:</b> abdominal distress, abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, asthenia, dyspepsia, fatigue, gastrointestinal pain, lower abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, decreased appetite, and malaise.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to dulaglutide: subcutaneous solution</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Subcutaneous route (Solution)</p><p>In male and female rats, dulaglutide caused a dose-related and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) after lifetime exposure. It is unknown whether dulaglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as human relevance of dulaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. Dulaglutide is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC and in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Counsel patients regarding the potential risk of MTC with use of dulaglutide and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (eg, mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with dulaglutide.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, dulaglutide (the active ingredient contained in Trulicity) may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>

<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Decreased appetite<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>During clinical trials, a mean increase in heart rate of 2 to 4 beats per minute was observed.  Sinus tachycardia was reported in 2.8% and 5.6% of patients receiving 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg of dulaglutide (the active ingredient contained in Trulicity) compared with 3% in placebo.  Persistent sinus tachycardia defined as occurring at more than 2 visits was reported in 0.4%, 1.6%, and 0.2% of patients receiving dulaglutide 0.75 mg, 1.5 mg, or placebo.  Episodes of sinus tachycardia associated with an increase of 15 or more beats per minute from baseline occurred in 1.3%, 2.2%, and 0.7% of patients, respectively.</p>

<p>During clinical trials, a 2 to 3 millisecond mean increase from baseline in PR interval was observed in dulaglutide-treated patients compared to a mean decrease of 0.9 milliseconds in placebo-treated patients.  AV block occurred more frequently compared with placebo (0.9%, 1.7% and 2.3% for placebo, 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg, respectively).  On electrocardiograms, a PR interval increase to at least 220 milliseconds was observed in 0.7%, 2.5% and 3.2% of patients treated with placebo, 0.75 mg, 1.5 mg, respectively.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): First degree AV block, sinus tachycardia, PR prolongation on ECG</p>
