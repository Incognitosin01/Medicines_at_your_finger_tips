<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to empagliflozin: oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>The most common reported side effects included urinary tract infections and female genital mycotic infections.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Hypoglycemia</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Diabetic ketoacidosis, ketoacidosis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Frequency of hypoglycemia depended on the type of background therapy used.  In combination with metformin and sulfonylurea, hypoglycemia was reported in 16.1% of patients taking the 10 mg dose and 11.5% in patients taking the 25 mg dose.  In combination with insulin, hypoglycemia was reported in 22.5% of patients taking the 10 mg dose and 29.7% in patients taking the 25 mg dose.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reports of ketoacidosis have been identified during postmarketing surveillance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors including this drug.  For many of the reports, especially among patients with type 1 diabetes, ketoacidosis was not immediately recognized and treatment was delayed because presenting blood glucose levels were lower (often less than 250 mg/dL [14 mmol/l]) than those typically expected.  Signs and symptoms on presentation were consistent with ketoacidosis and included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath.  In some, but not all cases, patients had an identifiable risk factor such as insulin dose reduction, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, surgery, pancreatic disorder suggesting insulin deficiency (e.g., type 1 diabetes, history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery), and alcohol abuse.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Increased urination</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Dysuria</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Increased serum creatinine, decreased eGFR</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Acute kidney injury, urosepsis, pyelonephritis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Genitourinary</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Female and male genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infection</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Phimosis</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Urosepsis, pyelonephritis, Fournier's gangrene<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>In the 5 years (2013 to 2018) since SGLT2 inhibitor approval, 12 cases of Fournier's gangrene have been reported.  Reports were almost equal in men and women (men=7; women=5), ages ranged from 38 to 78 years, and the average time to onset after starting an SGLT2 inhibitor was 9.2 months (range 7 days to 25 months).  All SGLT2 inhibitor drugs except ertugliflozin were included in the reports.  Ertugliflozin being the most recently approved agent, is expected to have the same risk, but insufficient patient use to assess risk.  All patients were hospitalized, all required surgery, all required surgical debridement, 5 required more than 1 surgery and 1 required skin grafting.  Four cases were complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, and septic shock, leading to prolonged hospitalization, and death in 1 case.  In the general population, Fournier's gangrene occurs in about 1.6 out of 100,000 males annually, with the highest incidence in men 50 to 79 years.  Since diabetes is a risk factor for Fournier's gangrene, a review of the FAERS database for the last 34 years was done and only 6 cases (all males, median age 57 years) were found with several other classes of antidiabetic drugs.  Findings with SGLT2 inhibitors appear to show an association over a shorter time frame and involve both males and females.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Volume depletion</p>
