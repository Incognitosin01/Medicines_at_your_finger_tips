Elevations to greater than 3 x ULN of AST occurred in about 2% (n=5700) of patients at some point during treatment.  In an open-labeled trial among patients receiving NSAIDs, a higher incidence of transaminase elevations were observed in patients receiving diclofenac (the active ingredient contained in Zipsor) compared with other NSAIDs.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Elevated liver enzymes</p>

<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Confusion, drowsiness, insomnia, paresthesia, tremors<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 3 years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal.

<p>Pharmacoepidemiological data reveal an increased risk of arteriothrombotic events associated with diclofenac (the active ingredient contained in Zipsor) use, particularly at a high dose and during long-term treatment.  In a meta-analysis of long-term treatment with diclofenac 150 mg/day, compared with placebo use of this drug resulted in approximately 3 additional major vascular events per 1000 participants.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Edema</p>
