Some of the dosage forms listed on this page <em>may not</em> apply to the brand name Janumet.</p><h2>In Summary</h2><p><b>Common side effects of Janumet include:</b> lactic acidosis. <b>Other side effects include:</b> nausea.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to metformin / sitagliptin: oral tablet, oral tablet extended release</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet; Tablet, Extended Release)</p><p>Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. Symptoms included malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated blood lactate levels, anion gap acidosis, an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL. Risk factors include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (eg, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors), age 65 years old or greater, radiological studies with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states, excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. If lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride/sitagliptin phosphate and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting; prompt hemodialysis is recommended.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, metformin / sitagliptin may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>

<p>Metformin:</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Hypoglycemia (5% or more when combined with glyburide)</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Hypoglycemia</p>
<p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Lactic acidosis, vitamin B12 deficiency<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>In metformin-treated patients, the incidence of lactic acidosis has been about 1.5 cases per 10,000 patient years.  The risk of lactic acidosis has been particularly high in patients with underlying renal insufficiency and rarely in patients with normal renal function.  Concomitant cardiovascular or liver disease, sepsis, and hypoxia have also increased the risk of lactic acidosis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Signs and symptoms of severe acidosis may include vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, dyspnea, hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12 absorption.  Malabsorption of vitamin B12, due to intrinsic factor deficiency and possibly other mechanisms, in as many as 30% of treated patients, were reported.  Megaloblastic anemia has occurred.  Decreased levels of vitamin B12 appear to be reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, vomiting </p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Constipation, upper abdominal pain, dry mouth</p>

Each case involved the use of 1 or more dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.  In all cases, substantial reduction in prior activity level was reported, 10 patients were hospitalized due to disabling joint pain.  In 22 cases, symptoms appeared within 1 month of starting therapy, in 23 cases symptoms resolved less than 1 month after discontinuation.  A positive rechallenge was reported in 8 cases, with 6 cases involving use of a different DPP-4 inhibitor.  Sitagliptin had the greatest number of cases reported (n=28) followed by saxagliptin (n=5), linagliptin (n=2), alogliptin (n=1), and vildagliptin (n=2).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Arthralgia</p>

<p></p>
<p>Metformin:</p>
<p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Urticaria, erythema, pruritus</p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p>Decreased serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations (rarely megaloblastic anemia), has been reported in approximately 7% of patients.  The reduction in vitamin B12 levels may be due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Rare</b> (less than 0.1%): Megaloblastic anemia<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><div class="referenceList"><h4 id="refs">References</h4><p id="ref_1">1.
