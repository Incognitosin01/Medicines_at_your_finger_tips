<p><b>Rare</b> (less than 0.1%): Intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding, colitis with bleeding, esophageal perforation, pancreatitis, ileus, esophageal ulcer, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Constipation, diverticulitis, dysphagia, eructation, esophagitis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastroesophageal reflux, hemorrhoids, hiatal hernia, melena, dry mouth, stomatitis, tenesmus, tooth disorder, vomiting<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Constipation, diverticulitis, dysphagia, eructation, esophagitis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastroesophageal reflux, hemorrhoids, hiatal hernia, melena, dry mouth, stomatitis, tenesmus, tooth disorder, vomiting have been reported in 0.1% to 1.9% of patients taking celecoxib 100 to 200 mg twice a day or 200 mg once a day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the Celecoxib Long-Term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS), complicated and symptomatic ulcer rates were 0.78% for all patients and 1.4% for patients 65 years and older at 9 months.  For the subgroup on concomitantly on low-dose aspirin, these numbers were 2.19% and 3.06%, respectively.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Serious gastrointestinal toxicity such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine, can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms in patient taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  Celecoxib should be used with caution in patients with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.  It is recommended that the lowest effective dose be administered for the shortest possible<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Peripheral edema</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Unstable angina, aortic valve incompetence, coronary artery atherosclerosis, sinus bradycardia, ventricular hypertrophy, deep vein thrombosis</p>
<p><b>Rare</b> (less than 0.1%): Syncope, cardiac failure congestive, ventricular fibrillation, thrombophlebitis</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Aggravated hypertension, angina pectoris, coronary artery disorder, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, palpitation, tachycardia</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Vasculitis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>In studies of up to 3-years with several NSAIDs (COX-2 selective and nonselective), an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, were observed.  It is unclear if the different NSAIDs pose a similar or different risk.  The relative increase in events over baseline appeared similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease.  However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, most likely due to their increased baseline rate.  The increase in CV thrombotic risk was observed most consistently at higher doses.  In the Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib (APC) trial, a 3-fold increased risk for the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke was observed for the celecoxib 200 and 400 mg twice a day arms compared to placebo.  This increase was mainly due to an increased incidence of MI.  In the Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety vs Ibuprofen or Naproxen (PRECISION) trial, celecoxib 100 mg twice a day was noninferior to naproxen 375 to 500 mg twice a day and ibuprofen 600 to 800 mg 3 times a day for the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke.  </p>

It is unclear if the different NSAIDs pose a similar or different risk.  The relative increase in events over baseline appeared similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease.  However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, most likely due to their increased baseline rate.  The increase in CV thrombotic risk was observed most consistently at higher doses.  In the Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib (APC) trial, a 3-fold increased risk for the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke was observed for the celecoxib 200 and 400 mg twice a day arms compared to placebo.  This increase was mainly due to an increased incidence of MI.  In the Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety vs Ibuprofen or Naproxen (PRECISION) trial, celecoxib 100 mg twice a day was noninferior to naproxen 375 to 500 mg twice a day and ibuprofen 600 to 800 mg 3 times a day for the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke.  </p><p></p><p>Aggravated hypertension, angina pectoris, coronary artery disorder, myocardial infarction, palpitation, tachycardia, and arrhythmia have been reported in 0.1% to 1.9% of patients taking celecoxib 100 to 200 mg twice a day or 200 mg once a day.
