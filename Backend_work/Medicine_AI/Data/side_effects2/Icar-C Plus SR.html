These effects are generally dose-related.  In addition, stools may appear darker in color in patients taking products containing iron.  Iron oral preparations may rarely cause Hemoccult-positive stools, patients with positive tests generally require further work-up.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p>Stained teeth have primarily occurred following ingestion of iron liquid preparation.</p><p></p><p>Iron overload (i.e., hemosiderosis) has been reported in patients genetically predisposed, or have underlying disorders, that augment the absorption of iron.  It has also occurred following administration of excessive parenteral iron therapy, combination of oral and parenteral iron, or in patients with hemoglobinopathies that were erroneously diagnosed as iron deficiency anemia.  Hemosiderosis is treated with repeated phlebotomy or long-term administration of deferoxamine.  The liver is particularly susceptible to toxicity in iron-overload states.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Other side effects associated with oral iron products have included stained teeth and iron overload (hemosiderosis).  Secondary hemochromatosis due to prolonged iron ingestion has been reported rarely.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>Metabolic side effects associated with iron have included decreased absorption of thyroxine (T4).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1.
