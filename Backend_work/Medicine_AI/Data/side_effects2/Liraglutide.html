It is unknown whether liraglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.Liraglutide is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC and in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of liraglutide and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (eg, a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, liraglutide may cause some unwanted effects.

<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Acute hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, including fatalities<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Chronic Weight Management: </p>
<p>-The percentage of patients reporting nausea declined as treatment continued.  Most gastrointestinal events were mild or moderate and did not lead to discontinuation.  </p>
<p>-Acute pancreatitis occurred in 0.3% (9/3291) of liraglutide-treated patients and 0.1% (1/1843) of placebo patients in clinical trials.  Three additional cases occurred in liraglutide-treated patients, 2 in patients who prematurely withdrew from the trial and 1 during an off-treatment follow-up period.  </p>
<p>-Acute gallbladder disease was reported more frequently in liraglutide-treated patients (1.5% versus 0.5%) during clinical trials.  Substantial or rapid weight loss can increase the risk of cholelithiasis, but even after accounting for the degree of weight loss, the incidence of acute gallbladder disease was greater in liraglutide-treated patients.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</p>
<p>-Postmarketing reports of acute hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, including fatalities have been reported.  During clinical trials, 13 cases of pancreatitis were received among liraglutide treated patients, 9 acute and 4 chronic compared with 1 case in the comparator (glimepiride) group; some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>-Serum amylase and lipase were routinely measure in the LEADER trial; elevations of 3 times the upper limit of normal were reported in 1% and 7.5% of liraglutide treated patients compared with 0.7 % and 4.5% of placebo, respectively.</p>
<p> -In the LEADER trial, 3.1% of liraglutide treated patients reported an acute event of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>Chronic Weight Management:</p>

<p>In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving this drug for chronic weight management, severe hypoglycemia occurred in 0.7% (3/422) of liraglutide-treated patients, each of these patients was also receiving a sulfonylurea.  Among all patients receiving this drug in combination with a sulfonylurea, symptomatic hypoglycemia occurred in 43.6% (48/110) of patients.  The dose of sulfonylurea had been reduced by 50% at the start of the trial.  Among patients not taking a sulfonylurea, symptomatic hypoglycemia occurred in 15.7% (49/312) of patients.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:</p>
<p>Major episodes of hypoglycemia have not been reported in clinical trials in which liraglutide was used as monotherapy, however, when used in combination with a sulfonylurea, hypoglycemia was very commonly reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Headache (up to 13.6%)</p>

<p>Cardiac conduction disorders were reported as first degree atrioventricular block, right bundle branch block, or left bundle branch block.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Increases in mean resting heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute (bpm) were observed in clinical trials.  Increases of 10 and 20 bpm at 2 consecutive visits were 34% and 5% in liraglutide-treated patients versus 19% and 2% in the placebo group, respectively.  Resting heart rate exceeding 100 bpm was recorded for 6% of liraglutide-treated patients versus 4% of placebo patients.  Tachycardia was reported in 0.6% of liraglutide-treated patients compared with 0.1% of placebo patients.  Monitoring heart rate over 24-hours found that liraglutide treatment was associated with a 4 to 9 bpm higher heart rate than placebo.  The clinical significance of this is unknown.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Genitourinary</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Urinary tract infection<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Local</h3><p>The most common injection site reactions were erythema, pruritus, and rash at the injection site.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Injection site erythema, injection site reaction<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Immunologic</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Development of anti-liraglutide antibodies<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Urticaria</p>

<p>Breast Cancer: During clinical trials, 0.6% (4/2379) of liraglutide-treated patients were diagnosed with breast cancer compared with 0.2% (3/1300) of placebo patients.  There were too few cases to determine if these were related to drug treatment and insufficient data to determine whether this drug had an effect on preexisting breast neoplasia.  </p>
<p>Papillary Thyroid Cancer: During clinical trials, 0.2% (7/3291) of the liraglutide-treated patients were diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma compared with no cases in 1843 placebo patients.</p>
<p>Colorectal Neoplasms: During clinical trials, 0.5% (17/3291) of the liraglutide-treated patients had benign colorectal neoplasms compared with 0.2% (4/1843) of placebo patients.  Malignant colorectal carcinoma was diagnosed in 2 liraglutide-treated patients.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: </p>
<p>In clinical trials, 6 cases of thyroid C-cell hyperplasia were reported among liraglutide-treated patients and 2 cases in the comparator-treated group (1.3 vs 1 case per 1000 patient-years).  Medullary thyroid carcinoma was diagnosed in 1 patient in the comparator group who had pretreatment serum calcitonin concentrations greater than 1000 ng/L suggesting preexisting disease.  The study required protocol-specified serum calcitonin measurements.  All cases of thyroid C-cell hyperplasia were diagnosed after thyroidectomy which was done due to abnormal calcitonin levels.  Of the 6 patients with thyroid C-cell hyperplasia, 5 had elevated calcitonin concentrations at baseline and throughout the trial.  One patient in both the liraglutide-treated group and the comparator group developed elevated calcitonin concentrations while on treatment.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Chronic Weight Management:</p>

Medullary thyroid carcinoma was diagnosed in 1 patient in the comparator group who had pretreatment serum calcitonin concentrations greater than 1000 ng/L suggesting preexisting disease.  The study required protocol-specified serum calcitonin measurements.  All cases of thyroid C-cell hyperplasia were diagnosed after thyroidectomy which was done due to abnormal calcitonin levels.  Of the 6 patients with thyroid C-cell hyperplasia, 5 had elevated calcitonin concentrations at baseline and throughout the trial.  One patient in both the liraglutide-treated group and the comparator group developed elevated calcitonin concentrations while on treatment.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Chronic Weight Management:</p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Benign colorectal neoplasms, papillary thyroid cancer, breast cancer, malignant colorectal carcinoma</p><p></p><p>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: </p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Thyroid neoplasms </p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Thyroid C-cell hyperplasia</p><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Medullary Thyroid Cancer<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1.
