This can lead to low levels of amniotic fluid surrounding the baby and possible complications.</p><p>For prescription NSAIDs, FDA is requiring changes to the prescribing information to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid.</p><p>For over-the-counter (OTC) NSAIDs intended for use in adults, FDA will also update the Drug Facts labels, available at: [Web]. These labels already warn to avoid using NSAIDs during the last 3 months of pregnancy because the medicines may cause problems in the unborn child or complications during delivery. The Drug Facts labels already advise pregnant and breastfeeding women to ask a health care professional before using these medicines.</p><p><b>BACKGROUND:</b></p><p>NSAIDs</p><p><ul>

<li>
If you are pregnant, do not use NSAIDs at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy unless specifically advised to do so by your health care professional because these medicines may cause problems in your unborn baby.</li></ul></p><ul>
<li>
If you are pregnant, do not use NSAIDs at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy unless specifically advised to do so by your health care professional because these medicines may cause problems in your unborn baby.</li></ul><p>
<li>
Many OTC medicines contain NSAIDs, including those used for pain, colds, flu, and insomnia, so it is important to read the Drug Facts labels, available at: [Web], to find out if the medicines contain NSAIDs.</li></p><p>
<li>
Talk to your health care professional or pharmacist if you have questions or concerns about NSAIDs or which medicines contain them.</li></p><p>
<li>
Other medicines, such as acetaminophen, are available to treat pain and fever during pregnancy. Talk to your pharmacist or health care professional for help deciding which might be best.</li></p><p></p><p><i>Health Care Professionals</i></p><p><ul>
<li>
FDA recommends that health care professionals should limit prescribing NSAIDs between 20 to 30 weeks of pregnancy and avoid prescribing them after 30 weeks of pregnancy. If NSAID treatment is determined necessary, limit use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if NSAID treatment extends beyond 48 hours and discontinue the NSAID if oligohydramnios is found. FDA is warning that use of NSAIDs around 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment.</li></ul></p><ul>

<li>
These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation.</li></p><p>
<li>
Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation.</li></p><p>
<li>
Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required.</li></p><p>
<li>
If NSAID treatment is deemed necessary between 20 to 30 weeks of pregnancy, limit use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. As currently described in the NSAID labels, avoid prescribing NSAIDs at 30 weeks and later in pregnancy because of the additional risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.</li></p><p>
<li>
The above recommendations do not apply to low-dose 81 mg aspirin prescribed for certain conditions in pregnancy.</li></p><p>
<li>
Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if NSAID treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue the NSAID if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice.</li></p><p></p><p>For more information visit the FDA website at: [Web] and [Web].</p><p>Side effects include:</p><p>Diarrhea, nausea with or without vomiting, other GI disorders, abdominal pain, flatulence, pyrosis, dizziness, headache, rash.   </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to meclofenamate: compounding powder, oral capsule</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>The most frequently reported side effects were gastrointestinal in nature and included diarrhea, nausea with or without vomiting, and abdominal pain.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Diarrhea (up to 33%), nausea (11%)</p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Vomiting, abdominal pain, pyrosis, flatulence, constipation, stomatitis, peptic ulcer</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Colitis, bleeding, perforation, ulcer, paralytic ileus<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Rash, urticaria, pruritus</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, hair loss<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Headache, dizziness</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Paresthesia, taste disturbance<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Edema, tinnitus</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Malaise, fatigue<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Palpitations<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Neutropenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, eosinophilia, hemoglobin decreased, hematocrit decreased<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Liver function tests abnormal, cholestatic jaundice<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Renal failure<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Anorexia<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Ocular</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Vision blurred, visual acuity decreased, temporary vision loss, reversible color vision loss, macular fibrosis, macular edema, perimacular edema, conjunctivitis, iritis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Psychiatric</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Depression, insomnia<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Genitourinary</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Nocturia<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Musculoskeletal</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Lupus-like syndrome<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Immunologic</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Serum sickness-like syndrome</p><p id="ref_1">1.
