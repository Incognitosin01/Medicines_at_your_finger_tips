<p>Rilpivirine:</p>
<p>-Postmarketing reports: Nephrotic syndrome<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Both components of this drug have increased serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function.

A mean change from baseline of 0.093 mg/dL (range: -0.3 to 0.58 mg/dL) or 8.22 mcmol/L (range: -26.5 to 51.2 mcmol/L) was reported after 48 weeks of therapy; these changes were not considered clinically significant.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Immunologic</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Immune reconstitution syndrome</p>

<p>-Frequency not reported: Decreased basal cortisol, abnormal 250 mcg adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, adrenal insufficiency<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>In the pooled phase 3 trials, at week 96, there was an overall mean change from baseline in basal cortisol of -0.69 mcg/dL in the rilpivirine group, and of -0.02 mcg/dL in the efavirenz group.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the rilpivirine group, 43 of 588 patients with normal 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test at baseline developed abnormal 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test (peak cortisol level less than 18.1 mcg/dL) during the trial versus 18 of 561 patients in the efavirenz group.  Abnormal 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test at week 96 was seen in 14 of the 43 rilpivirine patients and 9 of the 18 efavirenz patients.  Overall, there were no serious side effects, deaths, or treatment discontinuations that could clearly be attributed to adrenal insufficiency.  Clinical significance of abnormal 250 mcg ACTH stimulation tests in the rilpivirine group has not been established.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><div class="referenceList"><h4 id="refs">References</h4><p id="ref_1">1.
