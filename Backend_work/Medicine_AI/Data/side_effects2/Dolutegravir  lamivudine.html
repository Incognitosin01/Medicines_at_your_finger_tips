Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. If dolutegravir / lamivudine is used in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, additional treatment should be considered for appropriate treatment of chronic HBV; otherwise, consider an alternative regimen. Severe acute exacerbations of HBV have been reported in patients who are co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued lamivudine, a component of dolutegravir / lamivudine. Closely monitor hepatic function in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-HBV treatment.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, dolutegravir / lamivudine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>
