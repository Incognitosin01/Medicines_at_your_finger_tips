Some of the dosage forms listed on this page <em>may not</em> apply to the brand name Innohep.</p><p><i>Applies to tinzaparin: subcutaneous solution</i></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p>Patients previously exposed to unfractionated heparin or a low-molecular-weight heparin appear to be more susceptible to developing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and HIT-related thromboembolic complications (e.g., transient ischemic attack, stroke) than those who were never exposed.</p><p></p><p>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune-mediated, prothrombotic reaction that occurs in 0.5% to 5% of patients treated with unfractionated heparin and in less than 1% of patients treated with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).  The decrease in platelet count associated with HIT usually begins 5 to 14 days after starting heparin.  However, patients with a previous exposure to heparin may have an abrupt decrease in platelets upon restarting heparin.  Patients with LMWH-induced HIT exhibit a longer delay in the onset of symptoms compared with those who develop it from unfractionated heparin.  Following discontinuation, platelet counts begin to recover within 4 days, but may take more than 2 weeks in patients with high-titer HIT antibodies.  Thrombocytopenia is caused by heparin-dependent IgG antibodies that bind to a specific platelet protein, platelet factor 4 (PF4).  The heparin-PF4-IgG immune complex binds to platelets causing platelet activation.  The activated platelets cause release of platelet-derived procoagulant microparticles, which accelerate coagulation reactions and generates thrombin.  LMWHs have a high cross-reactivity with circulating heparin-PF4-IgG immune complex.  Factors associated with a higher risk for developing HIT-associated thrombosis include women, nonwhites, severity of thrombocytopenia, and lower body weight.  Complications associated with HIT include exacerbation of venous thromboembolism, arterial or venous thrombosis, limb gangrene, stroke, and skin necrosis.  The antibodies that cause HIT will usually disappear after approximately 3 months; therefore, use of unfractionated heparin or LMWH may be considered in a patient with a history of HIT if the antibody test is negative.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Hematologic side effects including epistaxis (1.9%), hemorrhage (1.5%), hematoma (greater than 1%), thrombocytopenia (greater than 1%), anemia (greater than 1%), and hematuria (1%) have been reported.  Other side effects including anorectal bleeding, cerebral/intracranial bleeding, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hemarthrosis, hematemesis, hemoptysis, ocular hemorrhage, injection site bleeding, melena, purpura, retroperitoneal/intra-abdominal bleeding, vaginal hemorrhage, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and wound hematoma have been reported in ongoing or completed clinical trials or from post marketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Cardiovascular side effects including chest pain (2.3%), hypotension (greater than 1%), tachycardia (greater than 1%), hypertension (greater than 1%), and angina pectoris (greater than 1%) have been reported.  Other side effects including myocardial infarction/coronary thrombosis, cardiac arrhythmias and thromboembolism have been reported in ongoing or completed clinical trials or from post marketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>A 66-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (who had been receiving dialysis for about a year) complained of hair loss from the right temporal area.  He had been taking enoxaparin for 9 months to prevent extracorporeal blood clotting, but was switched to tinzaparin (the active ingredient contained in Innohep) for the last three months.  It was suspected that the alopecia was due to tinzaparin use.  Tinzaparin was subsequently discontinued and enoxaparin was reinitiated.  A gradual regrowth of hair was noted over the next few months, with a full restoration of normal hair growth at 18 months.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Dermatologic side effects including rash (1.2%), bullous eruption (greater than 1%), erythematous rash (greater than 1%), and pruritus (greater than 1%) have been reported.

Diffuse alopecia in a diabetic man receiving tinzaparin has also been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Respiratory</h3><p>Respiratory tract symptoms including pulmonary embolism (2.3%) and dyspnea (1.2%) have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Hepatic side effects including cholestatic hepatitis and increases in hepatic enzymes have been reported in ongoing or completed clinical trials or from post marketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>General</h3><p>General side effects including headache (1.7%), pain (1.5%), fever (1.5%), insomnia (greater than 1%), and healing impairment (greater than 1%) have been reported.
