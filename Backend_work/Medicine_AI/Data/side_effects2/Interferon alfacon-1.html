During clinical trials, more than 560 and 480 patients were exposed to monotherapy and combination therapy, respectively.  In monotherapy studies, influenza-like symptoms (i.e., headache, fatigue, fever, rigors, myalgia, arthralgia, and increased sweating) were reported most often and depression was the most common side effect resulting in drug discontinuation.  In the interferon alfacon-1 plus ribavirin combination therapy study, fatigue, nausea, influenza-like symptoms, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, neutropenia, leukopenia, insomnia, and depression were the most commonly reported side effects and fatigue, anemia, and depression were the most common side effects resulting in drug discontinuation.  The most common serious adverse reactions reported with combination therapy were neutropenia, suicidal ideation, and hyperuricemia.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p>Other side effects have included fatigue (up to 77%), rigors (up to 66%), fever/pyrexia (up to 61%), body pain (up to 54%), influenza-like illness/symptoms (up to 42%), chest pain (up to 13%), malaise (up to 11%), asthenia (up to 10%), hot flushes, peripheral edema, access pain, earache, taste perversion, and otitis.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Nervous system side effects have included headache (up to 82%), insomnia (up to 39%), dizziness (up to 25%), paresthesia (up to 13%), hypoesthesia (up to 10%), amnesia (up to 10%), hypertonia, somnolence, taste perversion, confusion, tinnitus, and hyperesthesia.

During the combination interferon alfacon-1 plus ribavirin trial, decreases in hemoglobin levels of greater than or equal to 2 g/dL from baseline were reported in 88% of patients.  Of these, 27% had hemoglobin levels decrease to less than or equal to 10 g/dL, and underwent dose reductions of ribavirin.</p><p></p><p>By the end of initial monotherapy treatment, mean decreases from baseline of 19% for white blood cells (WBCs) and 23% for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) were reported.  In patients subsequently retreated with monotherapy, mean decreases from baseline up to 23% for WBCs and up to 27% for ANC were reported.</p><p></p><p>Decreases in mean platelet count of 16% compared to baseline were observed by the end of monotherapy.  Grade 4 thrombocytopenia was reported in one patient during the alfacon-1 plus ribavirin combination trial.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Hematologic side effects have included leukopenia (up to 34%), neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, anemia, lymphocytosis, ecchymosis, lymphadenopathy, and increased prothrombin time.  Decreases in hemoglobin (monotherapy: 4%; combination therapy: 88%), hematocrit (monotherapy: 5%), total white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and platelet count have been reported.

At least one case of irreversible pulmonary artery hypertension has been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>A 36-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use and alcoholism experienced irreversible pulmonary artery hypertension coincident with interferon alfacon-1 therapy.  He was treated with interferon alfa-2a (3 million units/day) after he was found to have cirrhosis from Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and alcohol use.  His viral load was 100,000 copies of stage IV fibrosis on liver biopsy.  He was cleared of virus and received a liver transplant.  Subsequently, he again became HCV positive (greater than 85,000 copies/mL) and was treated with interferon alfacon-1 (15 mcg/kg).  Eight months into therapy, he developed progressive dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and edema.  He was found to have severe pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram (PAP 81/30) with right heart failure.  Other thromboembolic, inflammatory, and intrinsic cardiopulmonary causes were ruled out and interferon treatment was discontinued.  He continues to experience severe refractory pulmonary hypertension.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Ocular</h3><p>Ocular side effects have included conjunctivitis, abnormal vision, and eye pain.  Decrease or loss of vision, retinopathy (including macular edema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis, retinal hemorrhages, cotton wool spots), optic neuritis, papilledema, and serous retinal detachment have been induced or aggravated by treatment with interferon alfacon-1.
