In healthy patients, approximately 15 grams of acetaminophen is necessary to deplete liver glutathione stores by 70% in a 70 kg person.  However, hepatotoxicity has been reported following smaller doses.  Glutathione concentrations may be repleted by the antidote N-acetylcysteine.  One case report has suggested that hypothermia may also be beneficial in decreasing liver damage during overdose.</p><p></p><p>In a recent retrospective study of 306 patients admitted for acetaminophen overdose, 6.9% had severe liver injury but all recovered.  None of the 306 patients died.</p><p></p><p>A 19 year old female developed hepatotoxicity, reactive plasmacytosis and agranulocytosis followed by a leukemoid reaction after acute acetaminophen toxicity.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p>Caffeine: Rare (less than 0.1%): Fibrocystic breast disease<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>In one study of the effects of caffeine, 634 women with fibrocystic breast disease (compared to 1066 women without the disease), the occurrence of fibrocystic breast disease was positively associated with average daily consumption of caffeine.  Women who consumed 31 to 250 mg/day of caffeine were reported to have a 1.5 times increase in odds to have the disease.  Women who consumed over 500 mg/day of caffeine were reported to have a 2.3 times increase in odds.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>One study has suggested that acetaminophen may precipitate acute biliary pain and cholestasis.  The mechanism of this effect may be related to inhibition of prostaglandin and alterations in the regulation of the sphincter of Oddi.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Acetaminophen: Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Mostly seen in alcoholics and after overdose: Acute pancreatitis; Caffeine citrate: Very rare (less than 0.01%): Necrotizing enterocolitis in infants<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p>Acetaminophen: Rare (less than 0.1%): Acute tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis; these effects are most often observed after overdose or after chronic abuse (often with multiple analgesics), or in association with acetaminophen-related hepatotoxicity<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Acute tubular necrosis usually occurs in conjunction with liver failure, but has been observed as an isolated finding in rare cases.  A possible increase in the risk of renal cell carcinoma has been associated with chronic acetaminophen use as well.</p><p></p><p>A recent case control study of patients with end-stage renal disease suggested that long term consumption of acetaminophen may significantly increase the risk of end-stage renal disease particularly in patients taking more than two pills per day.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Acetaminophen: Rare (less than 0.1%): Anaphylaxis, fixed drug eruptions<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p>Acetaminophen: Rare (less than 0.1%): Thrombocytopenia, methemoglobinemia resulting in cyanosis in acute overdose<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Acetaminophen: Rare (0.01% 0.1%): Erythematous skin rashes, bullous erythema, purpura fulminans; Very rare (less than 0.01%): Potentially fatal skin reactions: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Respiratory</h3><p>Acetaminophen: Very rare (less than 0.01%): Eosinophilic pneumonia<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Acetaminophen: Very rare (less than 0.01%): Hypotension<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Caffeine: Frequency not reported: Caffeinism (Caffeinism is a syndrome characterized by anxiety, restlessness, and sleep disorders similar to anxiety states), aggravation of PMS</p><p id="ref_1">1.
