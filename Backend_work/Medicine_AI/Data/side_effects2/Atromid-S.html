Some of the dosage forms listed on this page <em>may not</em> apply to the brand name Atromid-S.</p><p><i>Applies to clofibrate: oral capsule</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>In general, the most common adverse effects due to clofibrate (the active ingredient contained in Atromid-S) therapy are gastrointestinal in nature (especially nausea) and may subside over time or with a decreased dosage.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis (sometimes requiring surgery or resulting in pancreatitis) occur more frequently in patients receiving clofibrate (the active ingredient contained in Atromid-S) than in patients receiving placebo.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Gastrointestinal reactions may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastritis, weight loss or gain, and gallstones (during prolonged therapy).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Musculoskeletal</h3><p>Musculoskeletal effects (myopathy) typically occur as a "flu-like" syndrome (myalgia, cramps, muscle weakness, and arthralgia).  Rhabdomyolysis with an accompanying increase in creatinine kinase and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) has been reported in patients with renal disease.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Patients diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis are usually asymptomatic clinically several days after discontinuing clofibrate, but the muscle enzymes may remain elevated for a more prolonged period.  Severe renal disease may increase the risk of myopathies, perhaps because of accumulation of the active metabolite clofibric acid.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>Electrolyte disturbances like hyperkalemia have been reported in patients with renal insufficiency who receive clofibrate (the active ingredient contained in Atromid-S) <sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Central nervous system depressant effects may include fatigue, weakness, drowsiness, and/or dizziness.  Headache has also been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p>Hematologic adverse effects may include leukopenia, anemia, eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, and potentiation of anticoagulant effects.  Because of these effects, some clinicians recommend periodic monitoring of blood counts.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Cardiovascular complications may include various arrhythmias and altered angina pectoris.  Swelling and phlebitis have occurred at xanthomata sites.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p>Renal dysfunction (including dysuria, hematuria, proteinuria, and decreased urine output) has been reported.  Acute renal failure and interstitial nephritis have also been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Genitourinary</h3><p>Decreased libido (primarily in men) and impotence have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Hepatic disorders may include elevated liver enzymes and/or hepatomegaly.  (Liver biopsy, when performed in this setting, is usually normal.)  Clofibrate (the active ingredient contained in Atromid-S) should be used cautiously for patients with a history of jaundice or liver disease.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Dermatologic reactions which occur in about 2% of patients may include urticaria, rash, dry skin, and alopecia.  Erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have occurred rarely.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>One case of a hypersensitivity reaction occurring as eosinophilic pneumonia has been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p>Fever, which occurred on rechallenge with clofibrate (the active ingredient contained in Atromid-S)  has been reported in one case.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Oncologic</h3><p>Oncologic effects of tumor growth in rodents have been associated with many lipid-lowering drugs.   Clofibrate (the active ingredient contained in Atromid-S) has been associated with liver, pancreatic and testicular tumors in rats.  Long-term clinical trials are needed to define the risk of cancer in humans.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1. "Product Information. Atromid-S (clofibrate)."
