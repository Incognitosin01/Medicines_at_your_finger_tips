<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to dalfopristin / quinupristin: intravenous powder for injection</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>In all 5 comparative studies, patients discontinued therapy with dalfopristin-quinupristin as compared to comparator for the following reasons: venous adverse events (9.2% versus 2% comparator), rash (1% versus 0.5% comparator), nausea (0.9% versus 0.6% comparator), vomiting (0.5% versus 0.5% comparator), pain (0.5% versus 0% comparator), and pruritus (0.5% versus 0.3% comparator).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the 2 comparative studies for complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI), the side effect profile observed differed significantly from the profile observed in the other comparative studies.  In these 2 comparative cSSSI studies, patients discontinued therapy with dalfopristin-quinupristin as compared to comparator for the following reasons: venous adverse events (12% versus 2% comparator), rash (2% versus 0.9% comparator), nausea (1.1% versus 0% comparator), vomiting (0.9% versus 0% comparator), pain (0.9% versus 0% comparator), and pruritus (0.9% versus 0.5% comparator).  Venous adverse events were mainly observed in patients with peripheral infusions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In noncomparative studies, approximately one-third of patients discontinued therapy due to side effects; however, the discontinuation rate due to side effects possibly or probably related to dalfopristin-quinupristin was about 5%.  The side effects leading to therapy discontinuation included increased total bilirubin (2.7%), increased conjugated bilirubin (2.3%), treatment-related arthralgia (2.3%), and treatment-related myalgia (1.8%).  High baseline total and conjugated bilirubin levels were recorded in 46.5% and 59% of patients, respectively, prior to study entry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a study with 93 patients, 21.5% discontinued treatment due to side effects.  The most common side effects were arthralgia, myalgia, nausea, and rash.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Local</h3><p>The manufacturer recommends flushing of the vein with 5% dextrose in water solution following each infusion of dalfopristin-quinupristin to minimize venous irritation.  Consideration should be given to changing the infusion site in patients with moderate to severe venous irritation.  Dalfopristin-quinupristin infusion (standard diluent volume of 250 mL) may also be further diluted (500 to 750 mL) in these patients.  Venous adverse events occurred predominately in patients who had peripheral infusions; therefore, a peripherally inserted central catheter or a central venous catheter may be utilized in selected patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Local side effects have frequently included inflammation at the infusion site (all comparative studies: 42%; comparative cSSSI studies: 44.7%), pain at the infusion site (all comparative studies: 40%; comparative cSSSI studies: 38.2%), infusion site edema (all comparative studies: 17.3%; comparative cSSSI studies: 18%), and infusion site reaction (all comparative studies: 13.4%; comparative cSSSI studies: 11.6%).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Musculoskeletal</h3><p>Musculoskeletal side effects have included arthralgia (up to 7.8%; severe: 3.3%), arthralgia and myalgia (up to 7.4%), myalgia (up to 5.1%; severe: 3.1%), elevated creatine phosphokinase (greater than 10 times ULN; 1.6%), and myasthenia (less than 1%).  Bone pain and neck rigidity have been reported in less than 0.1% of patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Some cases of arthralgia and myalgia noted improvement of symptoms with a reduction in dose frequency to every 12 hours.  Resolution of symptoms has been reported following discontinuation of dalfopristin-quinupristin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One trial with 93 patients reported an incidence of 10.8% and 8.6%, respectively, for arthralgia and myalgia.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Intravenous dalfopristin-quinupristin plus minocycline were associated with myalgia and arthralgia in 36% of neutropenic cancer patients (n=56).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Mild cases of pseudomembranous enterocolitis may respond to discontinuation of dalfopristin-quinupristin alone.  Moderate to severe cases may require fluid replacement, electrolytes, protein supplementation, and antibiotics for treating C difficile.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea (all comparative studies: 4.6%; comparative cSSSI studies: 4%; noncomparative studies: up to 4.9%), vomiting (all comparative studies: 2.7%; comparative cSSSI studies: 3.7%), and diarrhea (2.7%).  Abdominal pain, constipation, dyspepsia, oral moniliasis, pancreatitis, pseudomembranous enterocolitis, and stomatitis have been reported in less than 1% of patients.  Gastrointestinal hemorrhage (less than 0.2%), mesenteric arterial occlusion (less than 0.1%), and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Hepatic side effects have included increased conjugated bilirubin (greater than 5 times ULN; 3.1%), gamma-glutamyltransferase (greater than 10 times ULN; 1.9%), total bilirubin (greater than 5 times ULN; 0.9%), AST (greater than 10 times ULN; 0.9%), and ALT (greater than 10 times ULN; 0.4%).  Irrespective of relationship to dalfopristin-quinupristin, increased total bilirubin (greater than 5 times ULN; 25%) and conjugated bilirubin (greater than 5 times ULN; 34.6%) were reported during noncomparative studies.  Isolated hyperbilirubinemia (primarily conjugated bilirubin) can occur and is thought to be due to dalfopristin-quinupristin competing with bilirubin for excretion.  Hepatitis and jaundice have been reported in less than 0.1% of patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>High baseline total and conjugated bilirubin levels were recorded in 46.5% and 59% of patients, respectively, prior to noncomparative study entry.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Cardiovascular side effects have included thrombophlebitis (all comparative studies: 2.4%), thrombus or thrombophlebitis (comparative cSSSI studies: 1.7%), and hypotension (less than 0.2%).
