<p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Anaphylactic reactions</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Hypersensitivity reactions have included both local and systemic reactions.  Anaphylaxis has been reported.  Local reactions have presented as erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the injection site.  Most minor reactions to insulin at the injection site resolve in a few days to a few weeks.  In some instances these reactions have been caused by other factors such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique.  Localized reactions have been reported with metacresol, which is an excipient in many insulin products.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Generalized allergy to insulin may present as a whole body rash, dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension, tachycardia, or diaphoresis.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Immunologic</h3><p>Increases in titers of anti-insulin antibodies that react with human insulin have been observed; some data indicates the increase is transient.

<p><b>Rare</b> (less than 0.1%): Insulin resistance</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic syndrome, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Weight gain<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulin therapies.  The timing of hypoglycemia generally reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin, however, the time action profile of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or at different times in the same individual depending on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity.  Other factors such as changes in food intake (timing of meals, amount or type of food) and concomitant medications will also affect the risk of hypoglycemia.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Hypokalemia, which is due to a shift in potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space, occurs with all insulins.  Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia has been reported, particularly in patients treated for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).  Insulin increases the intracellular transport of phosphate, which often results in hypophosphatemia during treatment of DKA.  In situations in which not enough insulin is available to control blood glucose, hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic syndrome may occur.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Weight gain has been reported and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Local</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Injection site hypertrophy</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Injection site reactions<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Injection site reactions including pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling, and itching have occurred.  These usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks; rotation of the injection site reduces the risk of these reactions developing.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Acute painful peripheral neuropathy has been reported with insulin initiation and glucose control intensification.
