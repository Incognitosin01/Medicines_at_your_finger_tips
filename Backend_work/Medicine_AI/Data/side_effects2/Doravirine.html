<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to doravirine: oral tablet</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>The safety of this drug in patients with no antiretroviral treatment history was assessed in 2 phase 3 trials, as a single component in combination with emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) or abacavir-lamivudine and as a component of the fixed-dose combination drug (doravirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF).
