These symptoms usually begin within 1 to 3 hours of initiation of an amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate infusion and diminish with subsequent infusions.  Slowing the rate of infusion may control symptoms.  Severe infusion-related side effects associated with conventional amphotericin B administration have been lessened by pretreatment/treatment with corticosteroids, acetaminophen, antihistamines, and meperidine.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p>Renal toxicity has been reported less frequently with amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate than with conventional amphotericin B.  Increased serum creatinine, BUN, and hypokalemia have occurred in patients receiving amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate.  Acute kidney failure, abnormal renal function including oliguria, albuminuria, dysuria, glycosuria, and urinary incontinence and retention have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>Metabolic changes have occurred less frequently with amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate than with conventional amphotericin B.

Hyperglycemia, hypervolemia, and weight gain/loss have been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Common gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported.
