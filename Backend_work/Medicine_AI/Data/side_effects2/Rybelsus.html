Some of the dosage forms listed on this page <em>may not</em> apply to the brand name Rybelsus.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to semaglutide: subcutaneous solution</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Subcutaneous route (Solution)</p><p>Warning: Risk of Thyroid C-Cell TumorsIn rodents, semaglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures. It is unknown whether semaglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as human relevance of semaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.Semaglutide is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of semaglutide and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (eg, a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with semaglutide.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, semaglutide (the active ingredient contained in Rybelsus) may cause some unwanted effects.
