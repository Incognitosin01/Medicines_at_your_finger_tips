Anyone considering the use of paroxetine hydrochloride or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Paroxetine hydrochloride is not approved for use in pediatric patients. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, paroxetine (the active ingredient contained in Pexeva) may cause some unwanted effects.

<h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="professional">For Healthcare Professionals</h2><p><i>Applies to paroxetine: oral capsule, oral suspension, oral tablet, oral tablet extended release</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>Side effects are generally reported as mild.  The most common side effects associated with treatment discontinuation in clinical trials included somnolence, insomnia, agitation, tremor, anxiety, dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea, diarrhea, dry mouth, vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, abnormal ejaculation, sweating, impotence, and decreased libido.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The most common dose-dependent side effects associated with treatment discontinuation in clinical trials for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder with controlled-release paroxetine (the active ingredient contained in Pexeva) 25 mg compared with 12.5 mg included nausea, somnolence, impaired concentration, dry mouth, dizziness, decreased appetite, sweating, tremor, and yawn.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The most common side effects associated with treatment discontinuation in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms in clinical trials included abdominal pain, attention disturbances, headache, and suicidal ideation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a placebo-controlled study in elderly patients with major depressive disorder, the most common side effects associated with treatment discontinuation of controlled-release paroxetine included nausea, headache, depression, and abnormal LFTs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There may be adaptation to some side effects (such as nausea and dizziness) but not to others (such as dry mouth, somnolence, and asthenia) with continued therapy.  Paroxetine is less likely than tricyclic antidepressants to be associated with dry mouth, constipation, and somnolence.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Psychiatric</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Insomnia</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Abnormal dreams, agitation, anxiety, depersonalization, depression, drugged feeling, emotional lability, lack of emotion, nervousness</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Abnormal thinking, alcohol abuse, bruxism, euphoria, hallucinations, hostility, lack of emotion, manic reaction, neurosis, paranoid reaction</p>
<p><b>Rare</b> (less than 0.1%): Abnormal electroencephalogram, antisocial reaction, bulimia, delirium, delusions, drug dependence, hysteria, irritability, manic-depressive reaction, panic attacks, psychosis, psychotic depression, stupor, withdrawal syndrome</p>
<p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Suicidal ideation and behavior</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Confusional state, disorientation, homicidal ideation, restlessness<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.  An increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults (aged 18 to 24 years) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders has been reported with short-term use of antidepressant drugs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adult and pediatric patients receiving antidepressants for MDD, as well as for psychiatric and nonpsychiatric indications, have reported symptoms that may be precursors to emerging suicidality, including anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, and mania.  Causality has not been established.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pooled results from clinical trials report hallucinations in 22 of 9089 patients who received paroxetine and 4 of 3187 patients who received placebo.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Extrapyramidal symptoms such as akathisia, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, dystonia, hypertonia, and oculogyric crisis have been associated with concomitant pimozide therapy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SSRIs and SNRIs as monotherapy, but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs and drugs that impair the metabolism of serotonin.  Signs and symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome included agitation, confusion, diaphoresis, diarrhea, fever, hypertension, rigidity, and tachycardia, and were in some cases associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Dizziness, headache, somnolence, tremor</p>
<p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Amnesia, anxiety, CNS stimulation, confusion, hypertonia, impaired concentration, migraine, myoclonus, paresthesia, taste perversion</p>
<p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Ataxia, convulsion, dyskinesia, dystonia, hyperesthesia, hyperkinesia, hypokinesia, incoordination, neuralgia, neuropathy, nystagmus, paralysis, syncope</p>
<p><b>Rare</b> (less than 0.1%): Abnormal gait, adrenergic syndrome, akathisia, akinesia, anticholinergic syndrome, aphasia, cerebral ischemia, cerebrovascular accident, choreoathetosis, circumoral paresthesia, dysarthria, extrapyramidal syndrome, fasciculations, grand mal convulsions, hyperalgesia, meningitis, myelitis, peripheral neuritis, reflexes decreased, reflexes increased, taste loss, torticollis, trismus, vascular headache</p>
<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Eclampsia, Guillain-Barre syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, restless legs syndrome, serotonin syndrome, status epilepticus<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>The results of one study appear to indicate that treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (i.e., paroxetine (the active ingredient contained in Pexeva)  sertraline, citalopram) may cause an increase in serum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and/or LDL cholesterol.  However, additional studies are necessary to confirm these findings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Numerous cases of hyponatremia have been reported following treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).  Risk factors for the development of SSRI- associated hyponatremia including advanced age, female gender, concomitant use of diuretics, low body weight, and lower baseline serum sodium levels have been identified.  Hyponatremia tends to develop within the first few weeks of treatment (range 3 to 120 days) and typically resolves within 2 weeks (range 48 hours to 6 weeks) after therapy has been discontinued with some patients requiring treatment.  The proposed mechanism for the development of hyponatremia involves the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) via release of antidiuretic hormone.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Decreased appetite, increased appetite, increases in cholesterol levels, weight gain, weight loss</p>

<p>In placebo-controlled clinical trials, ejaculatory disturbance in men was reported in 13% to 28% of men taking paroxetine, compared to 0% to 2% in the placebo group.  Decreased libido was reported in 6% to 15% in men treated with paroxetine, compared to 0% to 5% in the placebo group, and in 0% to 9% in women treated with paroxetine, compared with 0% to 2% in placebo patients.  The estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance may underestimate their actual incidence, partly because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss this issue.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Decreased libido, ejaculation disturbance, other male genital disorders (primarily ejaculatory delay)</p>

Risk factors for the development of SSRI- associated hyponatremia including advanced age, female gender, concomitant use of diuretics, low body weight, and lower baseline serum sodium levels have been identified.  Hyponatremia tends to develop within the first few weeks of treatment (range 3 to 120 days) and typically resolves within 2 weeks (range 48 hours to 6 weeks) after therapy has been discontinued with some patients requiring treatment.  The proposed mechanism for the development of hyponatremia involves the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) via release of antidiuretic hormone.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Decreased appetite, increased appetite, increases in cholesterol levels, weight gain, weight loss</p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, thirst</p><p><b>Rare</b> (less than 0.1%): Alkaline phosphatase increased, creatinine phosphokinase increased, dehydration, diabetes mellitus, gamma globulins increased, gout, hypercalcemia, hypercholesteremia, hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, ketosis, lactic dehydrogenase increased, non-protein nitrogen increased, obesity </p><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Porphyria<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Chest pain, edema, palpitation, peripheral edema, tachycardia, vasodilation (usually flushing)</p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Abnormal electrocardiogram, angina pectoris, bradycardia, conduction abnormalities, hematoma, hypertension, hypotension, palpitation, postural hypotension, sinus tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia</p><p><b>Rare</b> (less than 0.1%): Arrhythmia, arrhythmia nodal, atrial arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, bundle branch block, cellulitis, congestive heart failure, extrasystoles, heart block, low cardiac output, myocardial infarct, myocardial ischemia, pallor, phlebitis, substernal chest pain, supraventricular extrasystoles, thrombophlebitis, thrombosis, varicose vein, ventricular extrasystoles</p><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Atrial fibrillation, pulmonary edema, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia (including torsades de pointes)<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p><b>Very common</b> (10% or more): Asthenia</p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Chills, pain, tinnitus, trauma, vertigo</p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Ear pain, fever, malaise, otitis media, overdose</p><p><b>Rare</b> (less than 0.1%): Abscess, deafness, hypothermia, otitis externa, sepsis, ulcer, abnormal laboratory value, cyst, hernia, intentional overdose</p><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Death<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Fatigue, malaise, and lethargy were very commonly reported in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials with paroxetine for treatment of vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Genitourinary</h3><p>There are several reports of priapism associated with paroxetine (the active ingredient contained in Pexeva) use.
