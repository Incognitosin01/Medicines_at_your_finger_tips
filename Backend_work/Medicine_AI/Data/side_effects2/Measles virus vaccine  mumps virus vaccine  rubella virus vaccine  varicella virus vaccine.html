Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognized measles in the first year of life or possibly from the measles vaccination.  </p><p>Based on estimated measles vaccine distribution in the United States (US), the association of SSPE cases to measles vaccination is about one case per million vaccine doses distributed.  The association with wild-type measles virus infection is 6 to 22 cases of SSPE per million cases of measles.  </p><p></p><p>Cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported following measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination.

Recipients of rubella vaccine may develop chronic joint symptoms.  Arthralgia and/or arthritis, and polyneuritis after wild-type rubella virus infection vary in frequency and severity with age and gender, being greatest in adult females and least in pre-pubertal children.  Following vaccination in children, reactions in joints are uncommon (0 to 3%) and of brief duration.  In women, incidence rates for arthritis and arthralgia are higher than those seen in children (12 to 26%), and the reactions tend to be more marked and of longer duration (e.g., months or years).  In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in incidence between those seen in children and adult women.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Genitourinary</h3><p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Orchitis, epididymitis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Ocular</h3><p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Edema of the eyelid, irritation, necrotizing retinitis (reported only in immunocompromised individuals), optic neuritis, retinitis, retrobulbar neuritis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1.
