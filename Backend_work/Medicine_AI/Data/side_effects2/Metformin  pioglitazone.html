 <h1>Metformin / pioglitazone Side Effects</h1><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Consumer</li>
<li>Professional</li></ul><h2>In Summary</h2><p><b>More frequently reported side effects include:</b> dental disease, edema, myalgia, pharyngitis, weight gain, and decreased vitamin b12 serum concentrate.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="consumer">For the Consumer</h2><p><i>Applies to metformin / pioglitazone: oral tablet</i></p><h3>Warning</h3><p class="blackboxWarning-title">Oral route (Tablet; Tablet, Extended Release)</p><p>May cause or worsen congestive heart failure, is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure, and is contraindicated in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure after initiation or dose increases and if heart failure occurs, consider dose reduction or discontinuing metformin/pioglitazone (immediate and extended-release formulations) and manage according to current standards of care. Lactic acidosis can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin / pioglitazone (immediate and extended-release formulations) and may result in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias; risk factors include renal impairment, concomitant carbonic anhydrase inhibitor use (eg, topiramate), age 65 years or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (eg, acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Onset is often subtle with nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain; laboratory abnormalities include elevated blood lactate (greater than 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without ketonuria or ketonemia), increased lactate:pyruvate ratio, and metformin levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL. If acidosis is suspected, discontinue treatment, hospitalize the patient immediately, and promptly initiate hemodialysis.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, metformin / pioglitazone may cause some unwanted effects.

A 10-year prospective cohort study in diabetic patients performed by the manufacturer (n=158,918 never users; n=34,181 ever users) identified 1075 newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer in never users and 186 cases in ever users.  The fully adjusted hazard ratio (HR) showed pioglitazone use was not associated with an increased risk (HR 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.26).  And while a modest trend towards higher risk with increasing duration was observed, this trend was not statistically significant.  Compared to the interim 5-year results, the 10-year results found weaker associations that were not statistically significant.  However, there are studies that have shown a statistically significant association between exposure to this drug and bladder cancer and an association between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure and bladder cancer.  Overall, this drug may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors, however there is insufficient data to determine whether this drug is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Metformin-pioglitazone</p>
