Discontinue moxifloxacin and avoid use of fluoroquinolones in patients with these serious adverse reactions. Reserve use of moxifloxacin for patients with no alternative treatment options for acute bacterial sinusitis or acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, moxifloxacin (the active ingredient contained in Avelox I.V.) may cause some unwanted effects.
