</ul><p class="ddc-notification"><b>Note:</b> This document contains side effect information about caffeine / magnesium salicylate. Some of the dosage forms listed on this page <em>may not</em> apply to the brand name Diurex.</p><p><i>Applies to caffeine/magnesium salicylate: oral tablet</i></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Nervous system side effects associated with caffeine consumption have included central nervous system stimulation such as irritability, restlessness, and jitteriness.  Tinnitus and subjective hearing loss (or both) may occur with salicylate.  Some investigators have reported that modest doses may result in decreased frequency selectivity and may therefore impair hearing performance, particularly in the setting of background noise.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Gastrointestinal side effects of both caffeine and salicylate have included epigastric distress, abdominal discomfort or pain, nausea, and vomiting.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p>Other side effects have included Reye's syndrome with salicylate use in children with an acute viral illness.  Reye's syndrome has also been reported even more rarely in adults.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Cardiovascular side effects associated with caffeine products have rarely included tachycardia, increased left ventricular output, and increased stroke volume.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>General</h3><p>In general, consumption of higher doses of caffeine (less than 600 mg/day) has been reported to have lead to caffeinism.  Caffeinism is a syndrome characterized by anxiety, restlessness, and sleep disorders (similar to anxiety states).  It has also been reported that chronic, heavy caffeine ingestion may be associated with depression.  Caffeine may cause anxiety and panic in panic disorder patients and may aggravate premenstrual syndrome (PMS).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p>Renal side effects associated with caffeine consumption have included increased urine flow rate, creatinine clearance, and sodium and calcium excretion.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Respiratory</h3><p>Respiratory side effects of salicylates have included bronchospastic reactions.  Nonacetylated salicylates rarely cause reactions even in susceptible people when very large doses are given.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Hypersensitivity side effects of magnesium salicylate include severe allergic reactions which may include hives, facial swelling, asthma, and shock.</p><p id="ref_1">1.
