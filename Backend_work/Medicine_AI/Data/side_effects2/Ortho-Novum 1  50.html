However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.  Numerous studies have looked at the incidence of breast cancer and use of oral contraceptives.  In a large, prospective cohort study (n=1.8 million; follow up 10.9 years), a small increased risk was reported in women using any hormonal contraceptive compared to women who had never used hormonal contraception.  The absolute risk was reported as 1 extra breast cancer for every 7690 women using hormonal contraception for 1 year.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Combined Oral Contraceptives: </p><p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Hepatocellular carcinomas</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Breast cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Psychiatric</h3><p>Combined Oral Contraceptives: </p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Nervousness, mood changes (including depression), changes in libido </p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Mental depression<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Immunologic</h3><p>Combined Oral Contraceptives: </p><p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus</p><h3>Ocular</h3><p>Combined Oral Contraceptives: </p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Intolerance to contact lenses </p><p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Optic neuritis, retinal vascular thrombosis </p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Changes in corneal curvature (steepening), cataracts, retinal thrombosis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Respiratory</h3><p>Combined Oral Contraceptives: </p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Pulmonary embolism</p><h3>Renal</h3><p>Combined Oral Contraceptives: </p><p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Hemolytic uremic syndrome</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Impaired renal function, cystitis-like syndrome</p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Combined Oral Contraceptives: </p><p><b>Common</b> (1% to 10%): Acne</p><p><b>Uncommon</b> (0.1% to 1%): Rash, chloasma (melasma), hirsutism, alopecia</p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Erythema nodosum</p><p><b>Very rare</b> (less than 0.01%): Erythema multiforme</p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Loss of scalp hair, hemorrhagic eruption, photosensitivity</p><h3>Other</h3><p>Combined Oral Contraceptives: </p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Fatigue<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Combined Oral Contraceptives: </p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, including very rare cases of urticaria, angioedema, and severe reactions with respiratory and circulatory symptoms</p><h3>Musculoskeletal</h3><p>Combined Oral Contraceptives: </p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Muscle spasms, back pain</p><p id="ref_1">1.
