Hypotension (2.9%) and angina/chest pain (1.2%) have occurred.  In addition, rare reports of torsades de pointes have been reported in postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Nervous system side effects have included headaches (2.9%) and tremor (0.4%).  Dizziness is most often associated with hypotension.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p>Milrinone has been shown to inhibit human platelet thromboxane A2 synthesis and calcium uptake.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Hematologic side effects of reversible thrombocytopenia (0.4%), inhibition of platelet activity, and increased bleeding time have occurred.  While these effects have been described in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who had received milrinone for 12 to 24 hours, they have not been associated with acute administration of milrinone.  The hematologic side effects of milrinone may be important in some patients who are awaiting cardiac catheterization, transplant, or other significant invasive procedures.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>General gastrointestinal complaints have been reported rarely.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Hypersensitivity reactions including rare instances of bronchospasm and anaphylactic shock have been reported in postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Hepatic side effects including liver function test abnormalities have been reported in postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Other</h3><p>Other side effects including rash and skin reactions have been reported in postmarketing experience.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>Metabolic side effects have included rare reports of hypokalemia (0.6%).<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Respiratory</h3><p>Respiratory side effects have been reported including isolated, spontaneous reports of bronchospasm.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Dermatologic side effects including rash has been reported in postmarketing experience.</p><h3>Local</h3><p>Local side effects including infusion site reaction has been reported in postmarketing experience.</p><p id="ref_1">1.
