Mannitol bronchial challenge testing is for diagnostic purposes only and should be conducted only by trained professionals under a physician familiar with the test and management of acute bronchospasm (ie, testing area equipped with appropriate medications and equipment). Immediately administer a short-acting inhaled beta-agonist in the event of severe bronchospasm. Do not perform bronchial challenge testing with mannitol in a patient with asthma or very low baseline pulmonary function tests (eg, FEV1 less than 1 to 1.5 L or less than 70% of the predicted values).</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, mannitol (the active ingredient contained in Bronchitol) may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>

Six patients were treated with hemodialysis, one patient with peritoneal dialysis, and one patient died before initiation of treatment.  All patients received large doses over 1 to 3 days with a mean dose of 310 +/- 182.8 g.  CNS involvement consisted of CNS depression, confusion, lethargy, stupor, and coma.

She received oral acetazolamide, topical pilocarpine, topical timolol, and topical dexamethasone concomitantly for the treatment of glaucoma.
