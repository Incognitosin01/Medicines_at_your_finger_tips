Most (66%) side effects associated with this combination drug were of mild severity (grade 1).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The safety of this combination drug in virologically-suppressed patients was assessed in a trial where virologically-suppressed patients were switched from a baseline regimen to this combination drug; overall, the safety profile in virologically-suppressed patients was similar to the safety profile in patients with no antiretroviral treatment history.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, the side effects provided below were reported during the trial using this combination drug.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Psychiatric</h3><p>Most patients reported neuropsychiatric side effects as mild to moderate in severity; such events were mostly reported in the first 4 weeks of therapy.
