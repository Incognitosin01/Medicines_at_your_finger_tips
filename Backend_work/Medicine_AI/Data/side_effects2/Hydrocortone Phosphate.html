Short-term effects have included sodium retention-related weight gain and fluid accumulation, hyperglycemia/glucose intolerance, hypokalemia, and psychic disturbances.  Long-term effects have included hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal activity suppression, Cushingoid appearance, hirsutism, impotence, menstrual irregularities, peptic ulcer disease, cataracts and increased intraocular pressure/glaucoma, myopathy, osteoporosis, and vertebral compression fractures.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Bradycardia, cardiac arrest, cardia arrhythmias, cardiac enlargement, circulatory collapse, fat embolism, hypertension, congestive heart failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in premature infants, myocardial rupture following recent myocardial infarction, thrombophlebitis, vasculitis, syncope, tachycardia, thromboembolism, thrombophlebitis, vasculitis, necrotising angiitis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Endocrine</h3><p>An antagonism occurs between the parathyroids and hypercorticism.

Corticosteroid myopathy has presented as weakness and wasting of the proximal limb and girdle muscles and generally has been reversible following cessation of therapy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Corticosteroids inhibit intestinal absorption and increase urinary excretion of calcium leading to bone resorption and bone loss.  Postmenopausal females are at risk of loss of bone density.  Sixteen percent of elderly patients treated with corticosteroids for 5 years may experience vertebral compression fractures.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Immunologic</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Impairment in cell-mediated immunity, increased susceptibility to bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections, immunosuppression, opportunistic infections from mild to fatal, reactivation of tuberculosis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Increases in serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase have been observed with corticosteroid therapy; these laboratory changes are generally small, not associated with clinical symptoms, and are reversible upon discontinuation.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Reversible increases in serum transaminase and alkaline phosphatase concentrations, hepatomegaly<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p>Corticosteroid therapy has been associated with a total increase in WBC; with an increase in neutrophils and a decrease in monocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Leukocytosis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Increased ease in bruising, ecchymosis, petechiae, delayed wound healing, acne, thin fragile skin, facial erythema, increased sweating, suppress reaction to skin testing, allergic dermatitis, burning or tingling in the perineal area after IV injection, cutaneous and subcutaneous atrophy, edema, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, erythema, sterile abscess, striae, thinning scalp hair, urticaria<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Ocular</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, posterior subcapsular cataracts, exophthalmos, central serous chorioretinopathy, corneal or scleral thinning, exacerbation of ophthalmic viral disease<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Psychiatric</h3><p><b>Frequency not reported</b>: Psychoses, personality or behavioral changes, depression, emotional instability, euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, psychic disorders, exacerbation of preexisting affect lability or psychotic behavior<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>In adults, the incidence of severe psychic reactions has been estimated to be around 5% to 6%.  Psychological effects have been reported on withdrawal of corticosteroids, although the incidence is unknown.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Case reports of hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids have been relatively uncommon.  Side effects have included bronchospasm, shock, urticaria, and angioedema.  Cross-reactivity between aspirin and hydrocortisone (the active ingredient contained in Hydrocortone Phosphate) in patients with aspirin-sensitive respiratory disease has been suggested as the mechanism in patients with asthma, however data are controversial.  Anaphylaxis has been most frequently associated with rapid injection or infusion of a high dose of corticosteroid.  Reactions may be mediated by an immune or nonimmune mechanism.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bronchospasm after intravenous hydrocortisone has been reported in some patients with aspirin-sensitive respiratory disease.  A challenge study with oral aspirin followed with 100 mg hydrocortisone (IV) resulted in respiratory reactions to aspirin in 45 of 53 patients.  These 45 patients then received a hydrocortisone challenge.  No naso-ocular, dermal, or respiratory reactions were noted in 44 of 45 patients administered hydrocortisone.  One aspirin-sensitive patient experienced bronchospasm and naso-ocular reactions to hydrocortisone and naso-ocular with minimal bronchospasm with methylprednisolone.  Following aspirin desensitization and while on maintenance aspirin therapy, this patient again reacted with similar symptoms to hydrocortisone.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p><b>Rare</b> (0.01% to 0.1%): Hypersensitivity reaction (enema)	</p>
