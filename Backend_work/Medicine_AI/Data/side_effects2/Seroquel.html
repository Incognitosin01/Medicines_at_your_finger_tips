While these effects have been shown as a class effect, each agent has its own profile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hyperglycemia: Adults: In controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks or less, 2.4% of patients with normal (less than 100 mg/dL) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) had at least 1 FPG reading of 126 mg/dL or greater (vs. placebo 1.4%) during treatment.  For patients with baseline borderline to high FPG (100 mg/dL or higher), 11.7% had at least 1 FPG reading of 126 mg/dL or greater (vs. placebo, 11.8%).  In 2 longer-term trials, the mean change in blood glucose from baseline in patients treated with this drug (mean exposure 213 days; n=646) was 5 mg/dL (vs. placebo -0.05 mg/dL).  Among patients with major depressive disorder receiving the extended-release formulation of this drug, a FBG greater than 126 mg/dL occurred in 7%, 12%, and 6% of those receiving 150 mg, 300 mg, or placebo.  In a study of patients 10 to 17 years old with bipolar mania, the mean change in fasting glucose was 3.62 mg/dL (n=170).  No patients with a baseline fasting glucose level lower than 126 mg/dL had a treatment-emergent blood glucose level greater than 126 mg/dL.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dyslipidemia: Across indications, adult patients who experienced shifts in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol from baseline to clinically significant levels occurred in up to 18%, 22%, 6%, and 14% of patients receiving this drug compared with up to 7%, 16%, 5%, and 14% receiving placebo, respectively.  For pediatric patients, the shifts were up to 12%, 22%, 8%, and 15% compared to up to 3%, 13%, 5%, and 19% for this drug and placebo, respectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Weight gain: Logistic regression analysis has shown a positive dose response for weight gain.  Five to 10% of adult patients experienced a weight gain of 7% or greater (vs. up to 5% in placebo).  Among children and adolescents, a weight gain of 7% or greater occurred in 7% to 21% of patients receiving this drug compared with up to 7% in placebo patients.  Mean change in body weight was 1.7 to 2 kg in 3- to 6-week trials and 4.4 kg in 26-week trials.  These results were not adjusted for normal growth.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>IR Formulations:</p>

<p><b>Postmarketing reports</b>: Nocturnal enuresis<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p>Collective data gathered from 17 placebo-controlled clinical studies (n=5106) involving the use of atypical antipsychotic agents, including this drug, for the treatment of behavioral disorders in the elderly patient with dementia showed a risk of death 1.6 to 1.7 times greater in the drug treated patient than in the placebo treated patient.  The average length of duration for the trials was 10 weeks with the cause of death in the majority of cases, though not all, reported as either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature.  Similar results (i.e., increased risk of mortality with atypical antipsychotics) were reported in another meta-analysis involving elderly dementia patients that consisted of 15 randomized, placebo-controlled trials (n=3353) of 10 to 12 weeks in duration.  This drug should not be used to treat behavioral disorders in elderly patients with dementia.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An increased risk of mortality, possibly due to heart failure or sudden death, has been reported with the use of atypical antipsychotic agents in the treatment of behavioral disorders in the elderly patient with dementia.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The results of a large retrospective cohort study appear to indicate that atypical antipsychotic agents (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, this drug) increase the risk of venous thromboembolism in elderly patients; however, these events seem to be rare.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Blood pressure elevations described as systolic elevations of 20 mmHg or greater and diastolic elevations of 10 mmHg or greater were observed in 15.2% and 40.6% of children and adolescents, respectively.  A child with a history of hypertension experienced a hypertensive crisis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>QT intervals have not been systematically evaluated.  During clinical trials, persistent increases in QT intervals were not identified; however there have been postmarketing reports of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on this drug, in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking drugs that are known to cause electrolyte imbalance or QT interval prolongation.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Immediate-Release (IR) Formulations:</p>

Among patients with major depressive disorder receiving the extended-release formulation of this drug, a FBG greater than 126 mg/dL occurred in 7%, 12%, and 6% of those receiving 150 mg, 300 mg, or placebo.  In a study of patients 10 to 17 years old with bipolar mania, the mean change in fasting glucose was 3.62 mg/dL (n=170).
