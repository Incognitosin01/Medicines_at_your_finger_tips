Some patients have developed hypertension and/or arrhythmias.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Pseudoephedrine causes vasoconstriction which generally does not produce hypertension, but may be problematic for patients with preexisting hypertension.  Arrhythmias may be produced in predisposed patients.  Rarely, pseudoephedrine has been reported to cause coronary artery spasm and chest pain.</p><p></p><p>One report evaluated the effect with 60 mg of pseudoephedrine on individuals in a hyperbaric chamber at 1 atmosphere (simulated scuba dive to 66 feet of sea water).  Pseudoephedrine and depth (simulated) were found to have significant but opposite effects on heart rate, although these effects were unlikely to be clinically significant during diving.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Nervous system side effects of dextromethorphan have included drowsiness and dizziness.  Other side effects such as excitation, mental confusion, and opioid like respiratory depression have been rare and occurred at higher dosages.  In some cases of abuse, patients experienced euphoria, hyperactivity, mania, and auditory and visual hallucinations.</p><p></p><p>Nervous system side effects of pseudoephedrine have included insomnia in up to 30% of patients.  Tremor, anxiety, nervousness, and headache have also been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Gastrointestinal side effects of dextromethorphan have included upset stomach.</p><p></p><p>Gastrointestinal side effects of pseudoephedrine have included anorexia and gastric irritation in approximately 5% of patients.  Dry mouth, nose, or throat have occurred in up to 15% of patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Hypersensitivity side effects of dextromethorphan have included rare reports of fixed-drug eruptions.</p><p></p><p>Hypersensitivity side effects of pseudoephedrine have included fixed drug eruptions.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p>Hepatic side effects of acetaminophen have included severe and sometimes fatal dose dependent hepatitis in alcoholic patients.  Hepatotoxicity has been increased during fasting.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Dermatologic</h3><p>Dermatologic side effects associated with acetaminophen includes the risk of rare but potentially fatal serious skin reactions known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP).</p><p id="ref_1">1.
