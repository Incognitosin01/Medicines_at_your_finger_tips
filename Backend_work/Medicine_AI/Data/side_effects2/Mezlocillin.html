</ul><p><i>Applies to mezlocillin: injectable powder for injection</i></p><h3>General</h3><p>Mezlocillin is generally well-tolerated.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p>Hypersensitivity reactions are usually mild.  General skin reactions and eosinophilia occur in up to 3% of treated patients.  As with other penicillins, hypersensitivity reactions may include urticarial rash, angioedema, pruritus, and, in rare cases, bronchospasm, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Rare cases of interstitial nephritis related to mezlocillin are likely due to hypersensitivity.  Intravenous administration may result in thrombophlebitis or vein irritation in rare cases.</p><p></p><p>One small study demonstrated an increased incidence of allergic reactions in patients with cystic fibrosis who were given mezlocillin.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p>Nausea, vomiting, and altered sensation of taste have been reported.  Mild and transient elevations of liver function tests are rare.  A rare case of cholestatic jaundice associated with mezlocillin has been reported.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Gastrointestinal side effects are among the most common adverse effects, with diarrhea occurring in up to 3% of patients.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Renal</h3><p>Elevations of BUN and serum creatinine have been reported, but may be related to underlying illness.  Interstitial nephritis has been reported in rare cases.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Mezlocillin may cause a false positive sulfosalicylic acid test for proteinuria.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Hematologic</h3><p>Hematologic side effects are uncommon.  Leukopenia has been reported in less than 1% of patients.  Leukopenia has been reported in 23% of patients with liver disease receiving beta-lactam antibiotics.  Platelet dysfunction may occur in up to 25% of treated patients resulting in significantly prolonged bleeding times.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Agranulocytosis and nonhemolytic Coombs' positive tests have been reported.  In vitro studies show mezlocillin to cause decreased platelet aggregation, but no clinical bleeding has been observed.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Nervous system</h3><p>Although not reported with mezlocillin, convulsions and neuromuscular hyperirritability may be potential side effects of penicillin derivatives.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><h3>Metabolic</h3><p>Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported, but may have been due to factors other than mezlocillin therapy.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p>Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported, but may have been due to factors other than mezlocillin therapy.<sup>[Ref]</sup></p><p id="ref_1">1.
