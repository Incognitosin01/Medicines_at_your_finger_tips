Didanosine should be suspended in patients with suspected pancreatitis and discontinued in patients with confirmed pancreatitis.Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including didanosine and other antiretrovirals. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with other antiretroviral agents.Coadministration of didanosine and stavudine is contraindicated because of increased risk of serious and/or life-threatening events. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occurs</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, didanosine may cause some unwanted effects.
