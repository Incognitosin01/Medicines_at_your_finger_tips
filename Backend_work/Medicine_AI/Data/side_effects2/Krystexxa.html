Pegloticase should be administered in healthcare settings and by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis and infusion reactions. Patients should be premedicated with antihistamines and corticosteroids and be closely monitored for an appropriate period of time for anaphylaxis after administration of pegloticase. Monitor serum uric acid levels prior to infusions and consider discontinuing treatment if levels increase to above 6 mg/dL, particularly when 2 consecutive levels above 6 mg/dL are observed. Do not administer pegloticase to patients with G6PD deficiency. Hemolysis and methemoglobinemia have been reported with pegloticase in patients with G6PD deficiency. Screen patients at risk for G6PD deficiency prior to starting pegloticase.</p><h3>Side effects requiring immediate medical attention</h3><p>Along with its needed effects, pegloticase (the active ingredient contained in Krystexxa) may cause some unwanted effects.
