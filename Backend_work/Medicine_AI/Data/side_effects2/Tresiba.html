<p>In a study of adult insulin-experienced type 1 diabetes patients, 68.9% of patients receiving this were positive at baseline for anti-insulin degludec antibodies and 12.3% of the patients developed anti-insulin degludec antibodies at least once during the study.  In pediatric insulin-experienced patients with type 1 diabetes, 84.1% of those were positive at baseline for anti-insulin degludec antibodies and 5.8% of patients developed anti-insulin degludec antibodies at least once during the study.
