In therapy-naive patients, the change from baseline averaged 0.04 mg/dL (3.5 mcmol/L) after 144 weeks of therapy.

<p></p>
<p>In 1 trial, 248 HIV-1-infected patients with estimated CrCl between 30 and 69 mL/min (by Cockcroft-Gault method) were treated with cobicistat / elvitegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide for a median duration of 144 weeks; of these patients, 65% had previously been on a stable tenofovir DF-containing regimen.  This drug was permanently discontinued in 5 patients who developed renal side effects through 96 weeks; 3 of the 5 patients were among the 80 patients with baseline estimated CrCl less than 50 mL/min and 2 patients were among the 162 subjects with baseline estimated CrCl at least 50 mL/min.  No further renal discontinuations occurred between 96 and 144 weeks.  Overall, patients with renal dysfunction using cobicistat / elvitegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide in this study had a mean serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL at baseline and 1.4 mg/dL at 144 weeks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2 trials in therapy-naive HIV-1-infected patients (median baseline estimated CrCl 115 mL/min), mean serum creatinine increased by less than 0.1 mg/dL and 0.1 mg/dL from baseline to week 144 with cobicistat / elvitegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide and cobicistat/elvitegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF, respectively.  In a trial in virologically-suppressed tenofovir DF-treated patients (mean baseline estimated CrCl 112 mL/min) who switched to cobicistat / elvitegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide or who remained on initial regimen, mean serum creatinine was similar to baseline for both at 96 weeks.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In a clinical trial in HIV-1-infected therapy-naive patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction (eGFR between 50 and 89 mL/min), the change in serum creatinine and eGFR averaged 0.17 mg/dL and -6.9 mL/min, respectively, for cobicistat/elvitegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF.</p>
