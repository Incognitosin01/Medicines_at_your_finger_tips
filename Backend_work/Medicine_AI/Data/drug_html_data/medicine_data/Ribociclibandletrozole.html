</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for ribociclib and letrozole</h2><p>Ribociclib and letrozole combination is used in pre/perimenopausal or postmenopausal women to treat hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER-2 negative advanced or metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer.</p><p>Ribociclib belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.</p><p>Female hormones that occur naturally in the body can increase the growth of some breast cancers. Letrozole works by decreasing the amounts of these hormones in the body.</p><p>Ribociclib and letrozole is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using ribociclib and letrozole</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For ribociclib and letrozole, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to ribociclib and letrozole or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of ribociclib and letrozole combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ribociclib and letrozole combination in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking ribociclib and letrozole, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using ribociclib and letrozole with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>It is unlikely that a postmenopausal woman may become pregnant. But, using ribociclib and letrozole while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. If you are a woman who can bear children, your doctor may give you a pregnancy test before you start using ribociclib and letrozole to make sure you are not pregnant. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after your last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>If you plan to have children, talk with your doctor before using ribociclib and letrozole. Some men and women using ribociclib and letrozole have become infertile (unable to have children).</p><p>Interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis can occur while using ribociclib and letrozole. This can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain, cough, difficulty with breathing, fever or chills.</p><p>Serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) can occur with ribociclib and letrozole. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, red skin lesions, severe acne or a skin rash, sores or ulcers on the skin, or fever or chills with ribociclib and letrozole.</p><p>Contact your doctor right away if you have any changes to your heart rhythm. You might feel dizzy or faint, or you might have a fast, pounding, or uneven heartbeat.

These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.</p><p>Ribociclib and letrozole combination can temporarily lower the number of some types of blood cells in your blood. Because of this, you may bleed or get infections more easily. To help with these problems, avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor.
