</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Egrifta SV</h2><p class="First">Egrifta SV is indicated for the reduction of excess abdominal fat in HIV-infected adult patients with lipodystrophy.</p><p>Limitations of Use:</p><ul>
<li>Long-term cardiovascular safety of Egrifta SV has not been established. Consider risk/benefit of continuation of treatment in patients who have not had a reduction in visceral adipose tissue.</li>
<li>Egrifta SV is not indicated for weight loss management as it has a weight neutral effect.</li>
<li>There are no data to support improved compliance with anti-retroviral therapies in HIV-positive patients taking Egrifta SV.</li>
</ul><h2>Egrifta SV Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage and Administration</h3><ul>
<li>The dosage and administration recommendations in this prescribing information only apply to Egrifta SV (tesamorelin for injection) 2 mg per vial formulation. For dosage and administration recommendations for tesamorelin for injection 1 mg per vial formulation, see the EGRIFTA prescribing information. These two formulations and strengths have differences in the dosage, the number of vials required to prepare a dose, reconstitution instructions, and storage requirements.</li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">The dose of EGRIFTA SV is 1.4 mg, 0.35 mL of the reconstituted solution <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>, injected subcutaneously once daily.</span></li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Inject Egrifta SV into the abdomen. Rotate injection sites to different areas of the abdomen <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>. Do not inject into scar tissue, bruises or the navel.</span></li>
</ul><h3>Reconstitution Procedure</h3><ul>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Instruct patients to read the Instructions for Use enclosed in the Egrifta SV Medication Box.</span></li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Use only the diluent provided, Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to reconstitute Egrifta SV.</span></li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Reconstitute 1 vial of EGRIFTA SV lyophilized powder with 0.5 mL of diluent (2 mg per 0.5 mL).  Mix by rolling the vial gently in your hands for 30 seconds. Do not shake.</span></li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Inspect the reconstituted vial visually for particulate matter and discoloration. Use only if the solution is clear, colorless and without particulate matter.</span></li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Administer 0.35 mL of EGRIFTA SV immediately following reconstitution and throw away any unused solution and diluent. If not used immediately, discard the reconstituted solution. Do not freeze or refrigerate the reconstituted solution.</span></li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="C-BodyText First">EGRIFTA SV for injection is supplied in a single-dose 2 mg vial as a white to off-white lyophilized powder and a diluent of 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="C-BodyText First">Egrifta SV is contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul>
<li>Disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis due to hypophysectomy, hypopituitarism, pituitary tumor/surgery, head irradiation or head trauma.</li>
<li>Active malignancy. Any preexisting malignancy should be inactive and its treatment complete prior to instituting therapy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</li>
<li>Known hypersensitivity to tesamorelin or the excipients in EGRIFTA SV <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].</span></li>
<li>Pregnant women because modifying visceral adipose tissue offers no benefit in a pregnant woman and could result in fetal harm <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Increased Risk of Neoplasms</h3><p class="C-BodyText First"><span class="Italics">New Malignancy</span></p><p class="C-BodyText">Carefully consider the decision to start treatment with Egrifta SV based on the increased background risk of malignancies in HIV-positive patients.</p><p class="C-BodyText"><span class="Italics">Active Malignancy</span></p><p class="C-BodyText">Egrifta SV induces the release of endogenous growth hormone (GH), a known growth factor. Do not treat patients with active malignancy with EGRIFTA SV <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p class="C-BodyText"><span class="Italics">History of Malignancy</span></p><p class="C-BodyText">For patients with a history of non-malignant neoplasms, initiate Egrifta SV therapy after careful evaluation of the potential benefit of treatment. For patients with a history of treated and stable malignancies, initiate EGRIFTA SV therapy only after careful evaluation of the potential benefit of treatment relative to the risk of re-activation of the underlying malignancy. Discontinue Egrifta SV if there is any evidence of recurrent malignancy.</p><h3>Elevated IGF-1 Levels</h3><p class="C-BodyText First">Egrifta SV stimulates GH production and increases serum IGF-1, a growth factor. The effects of prolonged elevations in IGF-1 levels are unknown. Monitor IGF-1 levels during Egrifta SV therapy. Consider discontinuing EGRIFTA SV in patients with persistent elevations of IGF-1 levels (e.g., &gt;3 SDS), particularly if the efficacy response is not robust.</p><p class="C-BodyText">Among patients who received EGRIFTA for 26 weeks, 47% had IGF-1 levels greater than 2 standard deviation scores (SDS), and 36% had SDS &gt;3, with this effect seen as early as 13 weeks of treatment. Among those patients who remained on EGRIFTA for a total of 52 weeks, at the end of treatment, 34% had IGF-1 SDS &gt;2 and 23% had IGF-1 SDS &gt;3.</p><h3>Fluid Retention</h3><p class="First">Fluid retention may occur during EGRIFTA SV therapy and is thought to be related to the induction of GH secretion. This manifests as increased tissue turgor and musculoskeletal discomfort resulting in adverse reactions (e.g. edema, arthralgia, and carpal tunnel syndrome) which are either transient or resolve with discontinuation of treatment.</p><h3>Glucose Intolerance or Diabetes Mellitus</h3><p class="C-BodyText First">Egrifta SV treatment can result in glucose intolerance. During clinical trials, the percentages of patients with elevated HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> (≥ 6.5%) from baseline to Week 26 were 5% and 1% in the EGRIFTA and placebo groups, respectively. An increased risk of developing diabetes with EGRIFTA (HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> level ≥ 6.5%) relative to placebo was observed [intent-to-treat hazard odds ratio of 3.3 (CI 1.4, 9.6)].  </p><p class="C-BodyText">Evaluate glucose status prior to initiating Egrifta SV. Monitor all patients treated with Egrifta SV periodically to diagnose those who develop impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. If patients treated with Egrifta SV develop glucose intolerance or diabetes, consider discontinuing Egrifta SV in patients who do not show a clear efficacy response.</p><p>Egrifta SV increases IGF-1, monitor patients with diabetes who are receiving treatment with Egrifta SV at regular intervals for potential development or worsening of retinopathy.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="C-BodyText First">Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 4% of patients treated with EGRIFTA in clinical trials. Reactions included pruritus, erythema, flushing, urticaria, and rash.  In cases of suspected hypersensitivity reactions, advise patients to seek prompt medical attention and immediately discontinue treatment with Egrifta SV.</p><h3>Injection Site Reactions</h3><p class="C-BodyText First">Egrifta SV treatment may cause injection site reactions, including injection site erythema, pruritus, pain, irritation, and bruising. The incidence of injection site reactions was 25% in EGRIFTA treated patients and 14% in placebo-treated patients during the first 26 weeks of treatment in clinical trials. Rotate injection sites to different areas of the abdomen to decrease injection site reactions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].</span></p><h3>Increased Mortality in Patients with Acute Critical Illness</h3><p class="First">Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of growth hormone. Egrifta SV is a growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and since it stimulates growth hormone production, consider discontinuing Egrifta SV in critically ill patients.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="C-BodyText First">The following important adverse reactions are also described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul>
<li>Increased risk of neoplasms <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Elevated IGF-1 levels <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>Fluid retention <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
<li>Glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></li>
<li>Hypersensitivity reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span></li>
<li>Injection site reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="C-BodyText">The safety of Egrifta SV (2 mg/vial formulation) has been established based on clinical trials conducted with EGRIFTA (1 mg/vial formulation). Adverse reactions for the 1.4 mg dose (2 mg/vial formulation) of Egrifta SV are expected to be similar to those observed with the 2 mg dose (1 mg/vial formulation) of EGRIFTA <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>Seven hundred and forty (740) HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy and excess abdominal fat were treated with EGRIFTA in clinical trials; of these, 543 received EGRIFTA during the initial 26-week placebo-controlled phase.</p><p class="C-BodyText">The most commonly reported adverse reactions were hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, urticaria), edema-related reactions (e.g., arthralgia, extremity pain, peripheral edema, and carpal tunnel syndrome), hyperglycemia, and injection site reactions (injection site erythema, pruritus, pain, urticaria, irritation, swelling, and hemorrhage).</p><p>Adverse reactions that occurred more frequently with EGRIFTA relative to placebo and had an incidence ≥1% during the first 26 weeks across all studies are presented in Table 1.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">*</span> Injection site reaction includes: Injection site erythema, Injection site pruritus, Injection site rash, Injection site urticaria, Injection site pain, Injection site swelling, Injection site irritation, Injection site hemorrhage.</p><p class="C-BodyText">In the EGRIFTA clinical trials, mean baseline HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> was 5.3% among patients in both the EGRIFTA and placebo groups. Patients receiving EGRIFTA had an increased risk of developing diabetes (HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> level ≥ 6.5%) compared with placebo (5% vs. 1%), with a hazard ratio of 3.3 (CI 1.4, 9.6).</p><h3>Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">As with all therapeutic proteins and peptides, there is a potential for development of anti-EGRIFTA antibodies. The observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors, including assay sensitivity and specificity, methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to EGRIFTA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.</p><p class="C-BodyText">In the clinical trials with the EGRIFTA 1 mg/vial formulation, anti-tesamorelin IgG antibodies were detected in 50% of patients who received EGRIFTA for 26 weeks and 47% of patients who received EGRIFTA for 52 weeks. In the subset of patients with hypersensitivity reactions, anti-tesamorelin IgG antibodies were detected in 85%. Cross-reactivity to endogenous growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) was observed in approximately 60% of patients who developed anti-tesamorelin antibodies.  Patients with and without anti-tesamorelin IgG antibodies had similar mean reductions in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and IGF-1 response.  In a group of patients who had antibodies to tesamorelin after 26 weeks of treatment (56%) and were re-assessed 6 months later, after stopping EGRIFTA treatment, 18% were still antibody positive.</p><p>Neutralizing antibodies to tesamorelin and human GHRH (hGHRH) were detected in vitro at Week 52 in 10% and 5% of EGRIFTA-treated patients, respectively. Changes in VAT and IGF-1 levels in patients with or without in vitro neutralizing antibodies were comparable.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs</h3><p class="First">Co-administration of tesamorelin with simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate had no significant impact on the pharmacokinetics profiles of simvastatin in healthy subjects <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Egrifta SV stimulates GH production. Published data indicate that GH may modulate cytochrome P450 (CYP450) mediated antipyrine clearance. These data suggest that GH may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, and cyclosporine). Monitor patients for potential interactions when administering Egrifta SV in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes.</p><h3>Glucocorticoids</h3><p class="First">GH inhibits 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1), a microsomal enzyme required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. Egrifta SV stimulates GH production; therefore, patients receiving glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in maintenance or stress doses following initiation of Egrifta SV. Patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone may be affected more than others because conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11βHSD-1.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="Default First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Egrifta SV is contraindicated in pregnant women because modifying visceral adipose tissue offers no benefit in pregnant women and could result in fetal harm <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Considerations and Contraindications (4)]</span>. Administration of tesamorelin acetate to rats during organogenesis resulted in hydrocephaly in offspring at a dose of approximately two and four times the clinical dose, based on measured drug exposure (AUC). If Egrifta SV is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking it, discontinue Egrifta SV. </p><p class="Default">The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk</span></p><p>During pregnancy, visceral adipose tissue increases due to normal metabolic and hormonal changes. Modifying pregnancy-associated physiologic changes in visceral adipose tissue with Egrifta SV offers no known benefit and could result in fetal harm.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Tesamorelin acetate administration to rats during organogenesis and lactation resulted in hydrocephaly in offspring at a dose of approximately two and four times the clinical dose, respectively, based on measured drug exposure (AUC). Actual animal dose was 1.2 mg/kg. During organogenesis, lower doses approximately 0.1 to 1 times the clinical dose caused delayed skull ossification in rats. Actual animal doses were 0.1 to 0.6 mg/kg. No adverse developmental effects occurred in rabbits using doses up to approximately 500 times the clinical dose.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. There are no data on the presence of tesamorelin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of both the potential for (1) HIV-1 infection transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive patients), and (3) any possible adverse effects of tesamorelin, mothers should not breastfeed if they receive Egrifta SV.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Egrifta SV in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><p>In pediatric patients with open epiphyses, treatment with Egrifta SV may result in linear growth acceleration and excessive growth. Egrifta SV is not indicated for use in pediatric patients with open or closed epiphyses.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">There is no information on the use of Egrifta SV in patients greater than 65 years of age.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Egrifta SV has not been studied in patients with renal impairment.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Egrifta SV has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.</p><h2>Egrifta SV Description</h2><p class="First">Egrifta SV contains tesamorelin (as the acetate salt), a human growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) analog. The peptide precursor of tesamorelin acetate is produced synthetically and is comprised of the 44 amino acid sequence of human GRF. Tesamorelin acetate is made by attaching a hexenoyl moiety, a C6 chain with a double bond at position 3, to the tyrosine residue at the N-terminal part of the molecule. The molecular formula of tesamorelin acetate is C<span class="Sub">221</span>H<span class="Sub">366</span>N<span class="Sub">72</span>O<span class="Sub">67</span>S • x C<span class="Sub">2</span>H<span class="Sub">4</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span> (x ≈ 7) and its molecular weight (free base) is 5135.9 Daltons. The structural formula of tesamorelin acetate is:</p><p></p><p>Egrifta SV is a sterile, white to off-white, preservative-free lyophilized powder for subcutaneous injection. After reconstitution with the supplied diluent (Sterile Water for Injection, USP), the solution is clear and colorless. Each single-dose vial of Egrifta SV contains 2 mg of tesamorelin acetate and the following inactive ingredients: 20 mg mannitol, USP, 10 mg sucrose, NF, 0.78 mg histidine, USP and 0.05 mg polysorbate 20, NF.</p><h2>Egrifta SV - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">In vitro, tesamorelin binds and stimulates human GRF receptors with similar potency as the endogenous GRF <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><p>Growth hormone-releasing factor (GHRF), also known as growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), is a hypothalamic peptide that acts on the pituitary somatotroph cells to stimulate the synthesis and pulsatile release of endogenous growth hormone (GH), which is both anabolic and lipolytic. GH exerts its effects by interacting with specific receptors on a variety of target cells, including chondrocytes, osteoblasts, myocytes, hepatocytes, and adipocytes, resulting in a host of pharmacodynamic effects. Some, but not all these effects, are primarily mediated by IGF-1 produced in the liver and in peripheral tissues.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="C-BodyText First">Tesamorelin stimulates growth hormone secretion, and subsequently increases IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels. No clinically significant changes in the levels of other pituitary hormones, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and prolactin, were observed in patients receiving EGRIFTA in clinical trials.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>The absolute bioavailability of tesamorelin after subcutaneous administration of a 2 mg dose of EGRIFTA (1 mg/vial formulation) was determined to be less than 4% in healthy adult subjects.</p><p>Single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics have been characterized in healthy subjects and HIV-infected patients without lipodystrophy using a 2 mg dose of EGRIFTA (1 mg/vial formulation).  Tesamorelin mean extent of absorption (AUC) was 34% higher in HIV-infected patients than healthy subjects.  Tesamorelin peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) was similar in HIV-infected patients and healthy subjects. The median peak plasma tesamorelin concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 0.15 h in both populations.</p><p>Following single dose of subcutaneous administration of 1.4 mg of Egrifta SV (2 mg/vial formulation) in healthy subjects, the mean [coefficient of variation (CV)] AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span> was 889.1 (57%) pg<span class="Bold">.</span>h/mL. The mean (CV) C<span class="Sub">max</span> value was 2956.1 (47%) pg/mL and the median T<span class="Sub">max</span> was 0.15 h.</p><p>The systemic exposure (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUCs) of tesamorelin is similar between the 1.4 mg dose of Egrifta SV (2 mg/vial formulation) and the 2 mg dose of EGRIFTA (1 mg/vial formulation).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The mean volume of distribution (±SD) of tesamorelin following a single subcutaneous administration of the 1.4 mg dose of Egrifta SV (2 mg/vial formulation) was 4.8 ± 1.9 L/kg in healthy subjects.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>No formal metabolism studies have been performed in humans.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p class="C-BodyText">Mean elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of tesamorelin was 8 minutes in healthy subjects after single dose subcutaneous administration of the 1.4 mg of Egrifta SV (2 mg/vial formulation).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p class="C-BodyText">Pharmacokinetics of tesamorelin in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, in pediatric patients, or in elderly patients has not been established.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Simvastatin</span></p><p>The effect of multiple dose administration of EGRIFTA on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin and simvastatin acid was evaluated in healthy subjects. Co-administration with simvastatin (a CYP3A substrate) resulted in 8% decrease in extent of absorption (AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span>) and 5% increase in rate of absorption (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of simvastatin.

No potential mutagenicity of tesamorelin acetate was revealed in a battery of tests including induction of gene mutations in bacteria (the Ames test), gene mutations in mammalian cells grown in vitro (hamster CHOK1 cells), and chromosomal damage in intact animals (bone marrow cells in mice). There was no effect on fertility in male or female rats following administration of tesamorelin acetate at doses up to 0.6 mg/kg (approximately equal to clinical exposure) for 28 days in males or 14 days in females.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="C-BodyText First">The safety and effectiveness of Egrifta SV (2 mg/vial formulation) has been established based on adequate and well controlled studies with EGRIFTA (1 mg/vial formulation), as well as a demonstration of comparable bioavailability between the 1.4 mg Egrifta SV dose (2 mg/vial formulation) and the 2 mg EGRIFTA dose (1 mg/vial formulation) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span><span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy and excess abdominal fat (abdominal lipohypertrophy). Study 1 and Study 2 consisted of a 26-week Main Phase and a 26-week Extension Phase, respectively. Main inclusion criteria were age 18 to 65 years, a waist circumference ≥95 cm (37.4 inches) and a waist-to-hip ratio ≥0.94 for men and ≥94 cm (37.0 inches) and ≥0.88 for women, respectively, and fasting blood glucose (FBG) &lt;150 mg/dL (8.33 mmol/L). Main exclusion criteria included BMI ≤ 20 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, previous treatment with insulin or with oral hypoglycemic or insulin-sensitizing agents, history of malignancy, and hypopituitarism. Patients were on a stable anti-retroviral regimen for at least 8 weeks prior to randomization. Patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive a 2 mg dose of EGRIFTA (1 mg/vial formulation) or placebo subcutaneously daily for 26 weeks. The primary efficacy assessment for each of these studies was the percent change from baseline to Week 26 in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), as assessed by computed tomography (CT) scan at L4-L5 vertebral level. Secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in patient-reported outcomes related to body image, triglycerides, ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol, IGF-1 levels, and safety parameters. Other endpoints included changes from baseline in waist circumference, abdominal subcutaneous tissue (SAT), trunk fat, and lean body mass. In both studies, EGRIFTA-treated patients completing the 26-week treatment period were re-randomized to blinded therapy with either daily placebo or a 2 mg dose of EGRIFTA (1 mg/vial formulation) for an additional 26-week treatment period (Extension Phase) in order to assess maintenance of VAT reduction and to gather long-term safety data.
