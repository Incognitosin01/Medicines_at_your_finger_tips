</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Frovatriptan Succinate Tablets</h2><p class="First">Frovatriptan Succinate Tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Use only if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response for the first migraine attack treated with Frovatriptan Succinate Tablets, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before Frovatriptan Succinate Tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks.</li>
<li>Frovatriptan Succinate Tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks.</li>
<li>Safety and effectiveness of Frovatriptan Succinate Tablets have not been established for cluster headache.</li>
</ul><h2>Frovatriptan Succinate Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dosing Information</span></p><p>The recommended dose is a single tablet of frovatriptan succinate (frovatriptan 2.5 mg) taken orally with fluids.</p><p>If the migraine recurs after initial relief, a second tablet may be taken, providing there is an interval of at least 2 hours between doses. The total daily dose of Frovatriptan Succinate Tablets should not exceed 3 tablets (3 x 2.5 mg per 24-hour period).</p><p>There is no evidence that a second dose of Frovatriptan Succinate Tablets are effective in patients who do not respond to a first dose of the drug for the same headache.</p><p>The safety of treating an average of more than 4 migraine attacks in a 30-day period has not been established.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Frovatriptan Succinate Tablets, 2.5 mg are supplied as white to off-white, round shaped, biconvex, film-coated tablets, debossed with ‘A5’ on one side and plain on other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Frovatriptan Succinate Tablets are contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Ischemic coronary artery disease (CAD) (e.g., angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, or documented silent ischemia), or coronary artery vasospasm, including Prinzmetal’s angina <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</li>

<li>Recent use (i.e. within 24 hours) of another 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonist, an ergotamine containing or ergot-type medication such as dihydroergotamine (DHE) or methysergide <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]</span>.</li>
<li>Hypersensitivity to frovatriptan succinate (angioedema and anaphylaxis seen) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]</span>.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina</h3><p class="First">Frovatriptan succinate is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of frovatriptan succinate. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Frovatriptan succinate may cause coronary artery vasospasm  (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.</p><p>Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving frovatriptan succinate. Do not administer frovatriptan succinate if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first frovatriptan succinate dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following frovatriptan succinate administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of frovatriptan succinate.</p><h3>Arrhythmias</h3><p class="First">Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists. Discontinue frovatriptan succinate if these disturbances occur. Frovatriptan succinate is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Chest, Throat, Neck, and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure</h3><p class="First">Sensations of pain, tightness, pressure, and heaviness have been reported in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw after treatment with frovatriptan succinate and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of frovatriptan succinate is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s angina <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Cerebrovascular Events</h3><p class="First">Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not.</p><p>Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical of migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions need to be excluded. Frovatriptan succinate is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Other Vasospasm Reactions</h3><p class="First">Frovatriptan succinate may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5­-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before using frovatriptan succinate <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p>Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists have not been clearly established.</p><h3>Medication Overuse Headache</h3><p class="First">Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Serotonin syndrome may occur with frovatriptan succinate, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue frovatriptan succinate if serotonin syndrome is suspected.</p><h3>Increase in Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with frovatriptan succinate. Frovatriptan succinate is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of  reactions, including anaphylaxis  and angioedema, in patients receiving frovatriptan succinate. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Frovatriptan succinate tablet is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to frovatriptan succinate <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Frovatriptan succinate was evaluated in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, short-term trials. These trials involved 2,392 patients (1,554 on frovatriptan 2.5 mg and 838 on placebo). In these short-term trials, patients were predominately female (88%) and Caucasian (94%) with a mean age of 42 years (range 18 to 69). The treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred most frequently following administration of frovatriptan 2.5 mg (i.e<span class="Italics">.</span> in at least 2% of patients), and at an incidence <span class="Bold">&gt;</span> 1% greater than with placebo, were dizziness, paresthesia, headache, dry mouth, fatigue, flushing, hot or cold sensation, dyspepsia, skeletal pain, and chest pain. In a long-term, open-label study where 496 patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks with frovatriptan 2.5 mg for up to 1 year, 5% of patients (n=26) discontinued due to treatment-emergent adverse events.</p><p>Table 1 lists treatment-emergent adverse events reported within 48 hours of drug administration that occurred with frovatriptan 2.5 mg at an incidence of <span class="Bold">&gt;</span> 2% and more often than on placebo, in the four placebo-controlled trials. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these incidence estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ.</p><p><span class="Bold">T</span><span class="Bold">a</span><span class="Bold">ble 1:</span> <span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Reported within 48 Hours (Incidence <span class="Bold">&gt;</span> 2% and Greater Than Placebo) of</span> <span class="Bold">Patients in Four Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Trials</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Frovatriptan</span> <span class="Bold">2</span><span class="Bold">.5 mg</span></p><p>(n=1,554)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p>(n=838)</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">C</span><span class="Italics">entral &amp; peripheral nervous system</span></p><p>Dizziness</p><p>Headache</p><p>Paresthesia</p><p class="First">8%</p><p>4%</p><p>4%</p><p class="First">5%</p><p>3%</p><p>2%</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal system disorders</span></p><p>Dry mouth</p><p>Dyspepsia</p><p class="First">3%</p><p>2%</p><p class="First">1%</p><p>1%</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Body as a whole – general disorders</span></p><p>Fatigue</p><p>Hot or cold sensation</p><p>Chest pain</p><p class="First">5%</p><p>3%</p><p>2%</p><p class="First">2%</p><p>2%</p><p>1%</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Musculo-skeletal</span></p><p>Skeletal pain</p><p class="First">3%</p><p class="First">2%</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Vascular</span></p><p>Flushing</p><p class="First">4%</p><p class="First">2%</p><p>The incidence of adverse events in clinical trials did not increase when up to 3 doses were used within 24 hours.

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and frovatriptan succinate within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span>]</span>.</p><h3>5-HT1B/1D Agonists</h3><p class="First">Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of frovatriptan succinate and other 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors / Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of frovatriptan succinate in pregnant women.  In animal studies, frovatriptan produced developmental toxicity (embryofetal lethality, fetal abnormalities, and decreased embryofetal growth) when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses greater than those used clinically <span class="Italics">[see Animal Data]</span>.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</span></p><p>Published data have suggested that women with migraines may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>When pregnant rats were administered frovatriptan (oral doses of 0, 100, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg/day) throughout organogenesis, increased embryofetal mortality and an increased incidence of fetal malformations were observed at the high dose; decreased fetal body weights and increased incidences of fetal structural variations associated with growth impairment were observed at all doses.   The lowest effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (100 mg/kg/day) is approximately 130 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 7.5 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) basis.  </p><p>When pregnant rabbits were administered frovatriptan (oral doses of 0, 5, 20, or 80 mg/kg/day) throughout organogenesis, embryofetal mortality was increased at the mid and high doses. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) is approximately 13 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><p>Oral administration of frovatriptan (0, 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day) to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in increased embryofetal mortality at the high dose. The no effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity in rats (500 mg/kg/day) is approximately 650 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of frovatriptan in human milk, the effects of frovatriptan on the breastfed infant, or the effects of frovatriptan on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with frovatriptan resulted in levels of frovatriptan and/or its metabolites in milk up to four times higher than in plasma.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for frovatriptan succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from frovatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, frovatriptan succinate is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. There are no additional adverse reactions identified in pediatric patients based on postmarketing experience that were not previously identified in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Mean blood concentrations of frovatriptan in elderly patients were 1.5 to 2 times higher than those seen in younger adults <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.  No dosage adjustment is necessary.</p><h3>Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is necessary when frovatriptan succinate is given to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.</p><p>There is no clinical or pharmacokinetic experience with frovatriptan succinate in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Because a greater than two-fold increase in AUC is predicted in patients with severe hepatic impairment, there is a greater potential for adverse events in these patients, and frovatriptan succinate should therefore be used with caution in that population.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The elimination half-life of frovatriptan is 26 hours <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Therefore, monitoring of patients after overdose with frovatriptan should continue for at least 48 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. There is no specific antidote to frovatriptan. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of frovatriptan.</p><h2>Frovatriptan Succinate Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Frovatriptan Succinate Tablets contain frovatriptan succinate, a selective 5-hydroxy-tryptamine<span class="Sub">1</span> (5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span>) receptor subtype agonist (triptan), as the active ingredient. Frovatriptan succinate is chemically designated as R-(+) 3-methylamino-6-carboxamido-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole monosuccinate monohydrate and it has the following structure:</p><p>The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">23</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">5</span>.H<span class="Sub">2</span>O, representing a molecular weight of 379.4 g/mol.</p><p>Frovatriptan succinate is a white to off-white powder that is soluble in water.</p><p>Each frovatriptan succinate tablet for oral administration contains 3.91 mg frovatriptan succinate, equivalent to 2.5 mg of frovatriptan base. Each tablet also contains following inactive ingredients:  anhydrous lactose, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, polyethylene glycol, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, silicon dioxide, sodium starch glycolate, titanium dioxide and triacetin.</p><h2>Frovatriptan Succinate Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Frovatriptan binds with high affinity to 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptors. The therapeutic activity of frovatriptan succinate is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of frovatriptan are similar in migraine patients and healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>Mean maximum blood concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) in patients are achieved approximately 2 to 4 hours after administration of a single oral dose of frovatriptan 2.5 mg. The absolute bioavailability of an oral dose of frovatriptan 2.5 mg in healthy subjects is about 20% in males and 30% in females. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of frovatriptan, but delays t<span class="Sub">max</span> by one hour.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>Binding of frovatriptan to serum proteins is low (approximately 15%). Reversible binding to blood cells at equilibrium is approximately 60%, resulting in a blood: plasma ratio of about 2:1 in both males and females. The mean steady-state volume of distribution of frovatriptan following intravenous administration of 0.8 mg is 4.2 L/kg in males and 3.0 L/kg in females.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p><span class="Italics">I</span><span class="Italics">n vitro,</span> cytochrome P450 1A2 appears to be the principal enzyme involved in the metabolism of frovatriptan. Following administration of a single oral dose of radiolabeled frovatriptan 2.5 mg to healthy male and female subjects, 32% of the dose was recovered in urine and 62% in feces. Radiolabeled compounds excreted in urine were unchanged frovatriptan, hydroxylated frovatriptan, N-acetyl desmethyl frovatriptan, hydroxylated N-acetyl desmethyl frovatriptan and desmethyl frovatriptan, together with several other minor metabolites. Desmethyl frovatriptan has lower affinity for 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptors compared to the parent compound. The N-acetyl desmethyl metabolite has no significant affinity for 5-HT receptors. The activity of the other metabolites is unknown.</p><p><span class="Italics">Elimination</span></p><p>After an intravenous dose, mean clearance of frovatriptan was 220 and 130 mL/min in males and females, respectively. Renal clearance accounted for about 40% (82 mL/min) and 45% (60 mL/min) of total clearance in males and females, respectively. The mean terminal elimination half-life of frovatriptan in both males and females is approximately 26 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>The AUC of frovatriptan in patients with mild (Child-Pugh 5 to 6) to moderate (Child-Pugh 7 to 9) hepatic impairment was about twice that of young, healthy subjects, but within the range observed in healthy elderly subjects and was considerably lower than the values attained with higher doses of frovatriptan (up to 40 mg), which were not associated with any serious adverse effects. There is no clinical or pharmacokinetic experience with frovatriptan succinate in patients with severe hepatic impairment.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of frovatriptan following a single oral dose of 2.5 mg was not different in patients with renal impairment (5 males and 6 females, creatinine clearance 16 to 73 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function.</p><p><span class="Italics">Age</span></p><p>Mean AUC of frovatriptan was 1.5- to 2-fold higher in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 to 77 years) compared to those in healthy younger subjects (age 21 to 37 years).

No induction of drug metabolizing enzymes was observed following multiple dosing of frovatriptan to rats or on addition to human hepatocytes <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>.

Although a maximum tolerated dose was not achieved in the 84-week mouse study and in female rats, plasma exposures at the highest doses studied were higher than that achieved in humans at the MRHD of 7.5 mg/day. There were no increases in tumor incidence in the 84-week mouse study at doses producing plasma exposures (AUC) 140 times that in humans at the MRHD. In the rat study, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pituitary adenomas in males only at 85 mg/kg/day, a dose associated with a plasma AUC 250 times that in humans at the MRHD. In the 26-week p53(+/-) transgenic mouse study, the incidence of subcutaneous sarcomas was increased in females at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg/day.</p><p>These sarcomas were associated with subcutaneously implanted animal identification transponders, and are not considered to be relevant to humans. There were no other increases in tumor incidence of any type in any dose group.</p><p><span class="Italics">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Frovatriptan was clastogenic in human lymphocyte cultures, in the absence of metabolic activation. In the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), frovatriptan produced an equivocal response in the absence of metabolic activation. Frovatriptan was negative in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mouse lymphoma <span class="Italics">tk</span> assay and an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse bone marrow micronucleus test.</p><p><span class="Italics">I</span><span class="Italics">mpairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Male and female rats were dosed orally with frovatriptan prior to and during mating and in females up to implantation, at doses of 100, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 130, 650, and 1,300 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). At all dose levels, there was an increase in the number of females that mated on the first day of pairing compared to control animals. This occurred in conjunction with a prolongation of the estrous cycle. In addition, females had a decreased mean number of corpora lutea, and consequently a lower number of live fetuses per litter, which suggested a partial impairment of ovulation. There were no other fertility-related effects.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of frovatriptan succinate in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, short-term outpatient trials. In these trials, patients received doses of frovatriptan from 0.5 mg to 40 mg. In these controlled short-term trials, patients were predominately female (88%) and Caucasian (94%) with a mean age of 42 years (range 18 to 69). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed for up to 24 hours after dosing. The associated symptoms nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post dose. In two of the trials a second dose of frovatriptan succinate was provided after the initial treatment, to treat recurrence of the headache within 24 hours. Other medication, excluding other 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists and ergotamine containing compounds, was permitted from 2 hours after the first dose of frovatriptan succinate. The frequency and time to use of additional medications were also recorded.</p><p>In all four placebo-controlled trials, the percentage of patients achieving a headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater for those taking frovatriptan 2.5 mg compared to those taking placebo (Table 2).</p><p>Lower doses of frovatriptan (1 mg or 0.5 mg) were not effective at 2 hours. Higher doses (5 mg to 40 mg) of frovatriptan showed no added benefit over 2.5 mg but did cause a greater incidence of adverse events.</p><p><span class="Bold">T</span><span class="Bold">a</span><span class="Bold">ble 2:</span> <span class="Bold">Percentage of Patients with Headache Response (Mild or No Headache) 2 Hours Following Treatment<span class="Sup">a</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Frovatriptan</span> <span class="Bold">2</span><span class="Bold">.5 mg</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">42%* (n=90)</p><p class="First">22% (n=91)</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">39%* (n=187)</p><p class="First">21% (n=99)</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">46%** (n=672)</p><p class="First">27% (n=347)</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">37%** (n=438)</p><p class="First">23% (n=225)</p><p class="First">a ITT observed data, excludes patients who had missing data or were asleep.</p><p>*<span class="Italics">p</span>&lt;0.05.</p><p>**<span class="Italics">p</span>&lt;0.001 in comparison with placebo.</p><p>The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response by 2 hours following treatment is depicted in Figure 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response Within 2 Hours</span></p><p><span class="Bold"></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Figure 1 shows a Kaplan-Meier plot of the probability over time of obtaining headache response (no or mild pain) following treatment with frovatriptan 2.5 mg or placebo.
