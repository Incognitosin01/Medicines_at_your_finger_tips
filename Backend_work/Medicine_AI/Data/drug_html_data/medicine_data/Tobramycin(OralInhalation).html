Aerosolized antibiotics may be considered in patients who have experienced 3 or more exacerbations requiring antibiotic therapy per year; organism sensitivity should be considered when choosing an antibiotic. The risk of adverse events, cost of therapy, and patient status should be considered prior to initiating aerosolized tobramycin because the efficacy of aerosolized tobramycin in the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis has not been well documented <sup>[SIDP [Le 2010]]</sup>, <sup>[BTS [Pasteur 2010]]</sup>.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to tobramycin, other aminoglycosides, or any component of the formulation</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Cystic fibrosis: </b> Inhalation:</p><p>Bethkis, Kitabis Pak, Tobi: 300 mg every 12 hours (do not administer doses &lt;6 hours apart); administer in repeated cycles of 28 days on drug followed by 28 days off drug.</p><p>Tobi Podhaler: 112 mg (4 x 28 mg capsules) every 12 hours (do not administer doses &lt;6 hours apart); administer in repeated cycles of 28 days on drug followed by 28 days off drug.</p><p><i>Missed</i><i> dose:</i> If &lt;6 hours before next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and resume usual dosing schedule.</p><p><b>Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis</b> (off-label use): <b>Note:</b> Use may be considered in patients who have ≥3 exacerbations requiring antibiotic therapy per year; generally given in addition to oral or IV antimicrobials.

Some centers utilize this dose in non-CF patients for treatment of pulmonary disease (eg, bronchiectasis, tracheitis) (Rubin 2008): Children and Adolescents: 80 mg/dose 2 to 3 times daily</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Inhalation:</p><p>Bethkis, Kitabis Pak, Tobi: To be orally inhaled over ~15 minutes using a handheld reusable nebulizer (PARI-LC PLUS) with a PARI Vios air compressor (Bethkis) or a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor (Kitabis Pak, Tobi). If multiple different nebulizer treatments are required, administer bronchodilator first, followed by chest physiotherapy, any other nebulized medications, and then tobramycin last. Do not mix with other nebulizer medications.</p><p>Tobi Podhaler: Capsules should be administered by oral inhalation via Podhaler device following manufacturer recommendations for use and handling. Capsules should be removed from the blister packaging immediately prior to use and should not be swallowed. Patients requiring bronchodilator therapy should administer the bronchodilator 15 to 90 minutes prior to Tobi Podhaler. The sequence of chest physiotherapy and additional inhaled therapies is at the discretion of the healthcare provider; however, Tobi Podhaler should always be administered last. The Canadian labeling recommends that patients requiring bronchodilator therapy should administer the bronchodilator 15 to 90 minutes prior to administering Tobi Podhaler.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Powder, for inhalation (Tobi Podhaler):  Store in original package at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). Protect from moisture.</p><p>Solution, for inhalation (Bethkis, Kitabis Pak, Tobi): Store under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). May be stored in foil pouch (opened or unopened) at room temperature of 25°C (77°F) for up to 28 days. Protect from light. The colorless to pale yellow solution may darken over time if not stored under refrigeration; however, the color change does not affect product quality. Do not use if solution has been stored at room temperature for &gt;28 days.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Loop Diuretics: May enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Tobramycin (Oral Inhalation).

Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs should be closely monitored (renal function tests and serum tobramycin concentrations) as clinically indicated. If nephrotoxicity occurs, discontinue therapy until serum concentrations fall below 2 mcg/mL.</p><p>• Neuromuscular disorders: Use with caution in patients with neuromuscular disorders, including myasthenia gravis and Parkinson disease; neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur. Concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents may also increase risk for prolonged respiratory paralysis.</p><p>• Ototoxicity: Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or tinnitus, has been reported. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore, the onset of this symptom warrants further investigation. Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia, or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored (audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin concentrations). Baseline audiogram should be considered for patients at increased risk of auditory dysfunction. Use with caution in patients with preexisting vertigo, tinnitus, or hearing loss.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>The utility of monitoring serum concentrations in patients with renal impairment should be per health care provider discretion; serum concentrations achieved following inhalation are significantly less than those achieved following parenteral therapy in patients with normal renal function. Monitor serum tobramycin concentrations in patients with known or history of auditory dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and/or concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs. One hour after inhalation, serum concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL have been observed.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Aminoglycosides may cause fetal harm if administered to a pregnant woman. Systemic absorption of tobramycin following oral inhalation is expected to be low compared to intravenous administration; however, systemic exposure was associated with total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received another aminoglycoside during pregnancy.</p><p>Tobramycin inhalation may be used for the management of cystic fibrosis in pregnant patients with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (Edenborough 2008).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used in people with cystic fibrosis to treat a certain type of bacterial infection.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
