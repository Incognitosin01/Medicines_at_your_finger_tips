Dosage may be adjusted in 5-mg increments to achieve a balance of efficacy and tolerability (up to a maximum of 30 mg/day). In general, dosage adjustment may proceed at approximately weekly intervals.</p><h3>Pediatric Patients Aged 6 Years of Age and Older</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets is 5 mg once daily at approximately the same time each day. Dosage may be adjusted in 5-mg increments to achieve a balance of efficacy and tolerability (up to a maximum of 20 mg/day).</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP are available as 5,10 and 15 mg tablets for oral use:</p><p>5 mg: Light pink to pink, round, film-coated tablets, imprinted with ‘Λ13’ in black ink on one side and plain on the other side.</p><p>10 mg: Light pink to pink, round, film-coated tablets, imprinted with ‘Λ14’ in black ink on one side and plain on the other side.</p><p>15 mg: White to off-white, round, film-coated tablets, imprinted with ‘Λ15’ in black ink on one side and plain on the other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention, gastric retention and other severe decreased gastrointestinal motility conditions, uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma.</p><p>Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets is also contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug substance or other components of the product. There have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Angioedema</h3><p class="First">Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided.</p><h3>Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span> . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered.</p><p>Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms.</p><p>Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms.</p><h3>Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis</h3><p class="First">Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms.</p><h3>Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy</h3><p class="First">Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility.</p><h3>Urinary Retention</h3><p class="First">Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span> .</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span> .</p><p>Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony.</p><p>Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis.</p><p>As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, Ditropan IR (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by ≥ 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.</p><p>The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4.4% with Oxybutynin ER compared to 0% with Oxybutynin IR. The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth (0.7%).</p><p>The following adverse reactions were reported by &lt;1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: <span class="Italics">Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders:</span> anorexia, fluid retention; <span class="Italics">Vascular disorders:</span> hot flush; <span class="Italics">Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:</span> dysphonia; <span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal Disorders:</span> dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; <span class="Italics">General disorders and administration site conditions:</span> chest discomfort, thirst.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Infections and Infestations:</span> Urinary tract infection; <span class="Italics">Psychiatric Disorders:</span> psychotic disorder, agitation, confusional state, hallucinations, memory impairment, abnormal behavior; <span class="Italics">Nervous System Disorders:</span> convulsions; <span class="Italics">Eye Disorders:</span> glaucoma; <span class="Italics">Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders:</span> nasal congestion; <span class="Italics">Cardiac Disorders:</span> arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, QT interval prolongation; <span class="Italics">Vascular Disorders:</span> flushing, hypertension; <span class="Italics">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:</span> rash; <span class="Italics">Renal and Urinary Disorders:</span> impotence; <span class="Italics">General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:</span> hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, urticaria, and face edema; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment; <span class="Italics">Injury, poisoning and procedural complications:</span> fall.</p><p>Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include: cycloplegia, mydriasis, and suppression of lactation. In one reported case, concomitant use of oxybutynin with carbamazepine and dantrolene was associated with adverse events of vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech and nystagmus, suggestive of carbamazepine toxicity.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects.</p><p>Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide.</p><p>Mean oxybutynin plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies using oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in pregnant women. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk to the patient and fetus. Women who become pregnant during oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets treatment are encouraged to contact their physician.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Based on animal data, oxybutynin is predicted to have a low probability of increasing the risk of adverse developmental effects above background risk.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Animal Data</span></p><p>Reproduction studies with oxybutynin chloride in the mouse, rat, hamster, and rabbit showed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether oxybutynin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24-week, open-label, non-randomized trial. Patients were aged 6-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 to 20 mg/day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34% to 51%.</p><p>Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results. Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H <span class="Sub">2</span>O to 33 cm H <span class="Sub">2</span>O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H <span class="Sub">2</span>O) from 60% to 28%.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><p>Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing, dividing, or crushing, or in children under the age of 6.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar. The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were similar in all patients studied (up to 78 years of age).</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with renal impairment.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The continuous release of oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be considered in the treatment of overdosage. Patients should be monitored for at least 24 hours. Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. A cathartic may be administered.</p><p>Overdosage with oxybutynin chloride has been associated with anticholinergic effects including central nervous system excitation, flushing, fever, dehydration, cardiac arrhythmia, vomiting, and urinary retention.</p><p>Ingestion of 100 mg oxybutynin chloride in association with alcohol has been reported in a 13-year-old boy who experienced memory loss, and a 34-year-old woman who developed stupor, followed by disorientation and agitation on awakening, dilated pupils, dry skin, cardiac arrhythmia, and retention of urine. Both patients fully recovered with symptomatic treatment.</p><h2>Oxybutynin ER Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP is an antispasmodic, muscarinic antagonist. Each oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP contains 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP, formulated as a once-a-day controlled-release tablet for oral administration. Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R- and S-enantiomers.</p><p>Chemically, oxybutynin chloride is d,l (racemic) 4-diethylamino-2-butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride. The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C <span class="Sub">22</span>H <span class="Sub">31</span>NO <span class="Sub">3</span>•HCl.</p><p>Its structural formula is:</p><p>Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393.9. It is readily soluble in water and acids, but relatively insoluble in alkalis.</p><p>Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP also contains the following inert ingredients: Hypromellose, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Lactose Monohydrate, Povidone, Colloidal Silicon Dioxide, Magnesium Stearate, Methacrylic Acid and ethyl acrylate co-polymer dispersion, Triethyl Citrate, Talc, Titanium dioxide, Polyethylene glycol/Macrogol, Iron Oxide Yellow non-irradiated, Isopropyl alcohol and Iron Red Oxide non-irradiated. The ink contains shellac glaze (modified), Black Iron Oxide non-irradiated, N-Butyl alcohol, propylene glycol and ammonium hydroxide.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">System Components and Performance</span></p><p>Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP uses an enteric coated hydrophilic hydrogel matrix to deliver oxybutynin chloride at controlled rate over approximately 24 hours by diffusion mechanism. The system comprises of a core, which contains the drug, rate controlling hydrogel and other excipients. The core is surrounded by a partially or complete pH dependent membrane. Hence, when the drug reaches the acidic medium, in stomach minimal drug release will occur and when it reaches an environment of pH 5.5 and above, the outer membrane will be dissolved exposing the inner core. This inner core will partially hydrate to form a gel layer and the drug release will occur via diffusion mechanism from a gel layer and subsequently through gel erosion.</p><p>Meets USP Dissolution Method 4. FDA approved acceptance criteria differs from the USP acceptance criteria.</p><h2>Oxybutynin ER Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle. Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects).</p><p>Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R-isomer. A metabolite, desethyloxybutynin, has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder (vesical) capacity, diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, and delays the initial desire to void.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours, minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin.</p><p>The relative bioavailabilities of R- and S-oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are 156% and 187%, respectively, compared with oxybutynin. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R- and S-oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2. The plasma concentration-time profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 1 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Mean R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following a single dose of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg administered every 8 hours (n=23 for each treatment).</span></p><p></p><p>Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets dosing, with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters.</p><p>Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5-15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The children were on oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg (0.10 to 0.77 mg/kg). Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples. When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R- and S-oxybutynin and R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 3. The plasma-time concentration profiles for R- and S-oxybutynin are similar in shape; Figure 2 shows the profile for R-oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2: Mean steady state (± SD) R-oxybutynin plasma concentrations following administration of 5 to 20 mg oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets once daily in children aged 5–15. Plot represents all available data normalized to an equivalent of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 5 mg once daily.</span></p><p></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Food Effects</span></p><p>The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption. The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride. Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound (&gt;99%) to plasma proteins. Both enantiomers of N-desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound (&gt;97%) to plasma proteins. The major binding protein is alpha-1 acid glycoprotein.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall. Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid, which is pharmacologically inactive, and desethyloxybutynin, which is pharmacologically active. Following oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets administration, plasma concentrations of R- and S-desethyloxybutynin are 73% and 92%, respectively, of concentrations observed with oxybutynin.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with less than 0.1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. Also, less than 0.1% of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose Proportionality</span></p><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin (Cmax and AUC) following administration of 5-20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets are dose proportional.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Use in Specific Populations</span>s</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatric</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5–15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida). The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 1 and 2 above).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Gender</span></p><p>There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Race</span></p><p>Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on a human equivalent dose taking into account normalization of body surface area.</p><p>Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in <span class="Italics">Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>, and <span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span> test systems.</p><p>Reproduction studies with oxybutynin chloride in the mouse, rat, hamster, and rabbit showed no evidence of impaired fertility.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets was evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge) as evidenced by ≥ 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and ≥ 10 micturitions per day. Study 1 was a fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks.</p><p>The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5 and 6, and Figures 3, 4 and 5</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 3: Mean Change (±SD) in Urge Urinary Incontinence Episodes Per Week from Baseline (Study 1)</span></p><p></p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 4: Mean Change (±SD) in Urge Urinary Incontinence Episodes Per Week from Baseline (Study 2)</span></p><p></p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 5: Mean Change (±SD) in Urge Urinary Incontinence Episodes Per Week from Baseline (Study 3)</span></p><p></p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, USP are available in three dosage strengths, 5 mg (light pink to pink), 10 mg (light pink to pink) and 15 mg (white to off-white) and imprinted on one side with ‘Λ13’ or ‘Λ14’ or ‘Λ15’ with black ink.
