Do not chew or crush; or</p><p>Capsule can be opened and granules mixed with applesauce. Do not chew or crush granules.</p><p class="First">Delayed-Release Capsules</p><p class="First">Nasogastric Tube</p><p class="First">Capsule can be opened and the intact granules emptied into a catheter tipped syringe and delivered through the nasogastric tube.</p><p>Esomeprazole strontium delayed-release capsules should be swallowed whole. Do not chew or crush capsule.</p><p>Alternatively, for patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the esomeprazole strontium delayed-release capsule can be opened, and the granules inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The granules should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately: do not store for future use. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The granules should not be chewed or crushed. If the granules/applesauce mixture is not used in its entirety, the remaining mixture should be discarded immediately.</p><p>For patients who have a nasogastric tube in place, esomeprazole strontium delayed-release capsules can be opened and the intact granules emptied into a 60 mL catheter tipped syringe and mixed with 50 mL of water. It is important to only use a catheter tipped syringe when administering esomeprazole strontium delayed-release capsules through a nasogastric tube. Replace the plunger and shake the syringe vigorously for 15 seconds. Hold the syringe with the tip up and check for granules remaining in the tip. Attach the syringe to a nasogastric tube and deliver the contents of the syringe through the nasogastric tube into the stomach. After administering the granules, the nasogastric tube should be flushed with additional water. Do not administer the granules if they have dissolved or disintegrated.</p><p>The mixture must be used immediately after preparation.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Delayed-release capsules: 24.65 mg of esomeprazole strontium (equivalent to 20 mg of esomeprazole) - hard capsules with light pink cap and body containing off white to pale brown granules with HMP 20 printed in black ink.</p><p>Delayed-release capsules: 49.3 mg of esomeprazole strontium (equivalent to 40 mg of esomeprazole) - hard capsules with dark pink cap and body containing off white to pale brown granules with HMP 40 printed in black ink.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Esomeprazole strontium is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to proton pump inhibitors. Hypersensitivity reactions may include anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, acute interstitial nephritis, and urticaria <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6)].</span></p><p>For information about contraindications of antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated in combination with esomeprazole strontium, refer to the CONTRAINDICATIONS section of their package inserts.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Presence of Gastric Malignancy</h3><p class="First">In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with esomeprazole strontium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.</p><h3>Acute Interstitial Nephritis</h3><p class="First">Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including esomeprazole strontium.  Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction.  Discontinue esomeprazole strontium if acute interstitial nephritis develops <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First">Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like esomeprazole strontium may be associated with an increased risk of <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions</span> (6.2)<span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p>Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.</p><p><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents. For more information specific to antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated for use in combination with esomeprazole strontium, refer to WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS sections of those package inserts.</p><h3>Bone Fracture</h3><p class="First">Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</h3><p class="First">Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including esomeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematpus cases were CLE.</p><p>The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.</p><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating PPI treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.</p><p>Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving esomeprazole strontium, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.</p><h3>Interaction with Clopidogrel</h3><p class="First">Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole strontium with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as esomeprazole, that inhibit CYP2C19 activity. Concomitant use of clopidogrel with 40 mg esomeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel. When using esomeprazole strontium, consider alternative anti-platelet therapy <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency</h3><p class="First">Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rate reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed.</p><h3>Hypomagnesemia</h3><p class="First">Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.</p><p>For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Concomitant Use of Esomeprazole Strontium with St. John’s Wort or Rifampin</h3><p class="First">Drugs which induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (such as St. John’s Wort or rifampin) can substantially decrease esomeprazole concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>. Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole strontium with St. John’s Wort or rifampin.</p><h3>Interactions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors</h3><p class="First">Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Providers should temporarily stop esomeprazole treatment before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary.</p><h3>Concomitant Use of Esomeprazole Strontium with Methotrexate</h3><p class="First">Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.7)]</span>.</p><h3>Fundic Gland Polyps</h3><p class="First">PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year.  Most PPIs users who develop fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in labeling:</p><ul>
<li>Acute Interstitial Nephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</li>
<li>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</li>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety of esomeprazole strontium has been established from adequate and well-controlled studies of esomeprazole magnesium <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.  Below is a display of the adverse reactions of esomeprazole magnesium in these adequate and well-controlled studies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The safety of esomeprazole magnesium was evaluated in over 15,000 patients (aged 18 to 84 years) in clinical trials worldwide including over 8,500 patients in the United States and over 6,500 patients in Europe and Canada. Over 2,900 patients were treated in long-term studies for up to 6‑12 months. In general, esomeprazole magnesium was well tolerated in both short and long-term clinical trials.</p><p>The safety in the treatment of healing of erosive esophagitis was assessed in four randomized comparative clinical trials, which included 1,240 patients on 22.3 mg of esomeprazole magnesium (equivalent to 20 mg of esomeprazole), 2,434 patients on 44.6 mg of esomeprazole magnesium (equivalent to 40 mg of esomeprazole), and 3,008 patients on 20 mg of omeprazole daily. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions (≥1%) in all three groups were headache (5.5%, 5%, and 3.8%, respectively) and diarrhea (no difference among the three groups). Nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation, and dry mouth occurred at similar rates among patients taking esomeprazole magnesium or omeprazole.</p><p>Additional adverse reactions that were reported as possibly or probably related to esomeprazole magnesium with an incidence &lt;1% are listed below by body system:</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole:</span> abdomen enlarged, allergic reaction, asthenia, back pain, chest pain, substernal chest pain, facial edema, peripheral edema, hot flushes, fatigue, fever, flu-like disorder, generalized edema, leg edema, malaise, pain, rigors;</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> flushing, hypertension, tachycardia;</p><p><span class="Italics">Endocrine:</span> goiter;</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> bowel irregularity, constipation aggravated, dyspepsia, dysphagia, dysplasia GI, epigastric pain, eructation, esophageal disorder, frequent stools, gastroenteritis, GI hemorrhage, GI symptoms not otherwise specified, hiccup, melena, mouth disorder, pharynx disorder, rectal disorder, serum gastrin increased, tongue disorder, tongue edema, ulcerative stomatitis, vomiting;</p><p><span class="Italics">Hearing:</span> earache, tinnitus;</p><p><span class="Italics">Hematologic:</span> anemia, anemia hypochromic, cervical lymphadenopathy, epistaxis, leukocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia;</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic:</span> bilirubinemia, hepatic function abnormal, SGOT increased, SGPT increased;</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolic/Nutritional:</span> glycosuria, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, increased alkaline phosphatase, thirst, vitamin B12 deficiency, weight increase, weight decrease;</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> arthralgia, arthritis aggravated, arthropathy, cramps, fibromyalgia syndrome, hernia, polymyalgia rheumatica;</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System/Psychiatric:</span> anorexia, apathy, appetite increased, confusion, depression aggravated, dizziness, hypertonia, nervousness, hypoesthesia, impotence, insomnia, migraine, migraine aggravated, paresthesia, sleep disorder, somnolence, tremor, vertigo, visual field defect;</p><p><span class="Italics">Reproductive:</span> dysmenorrhea, menstrual disorder, vaginitis;</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory:</span> asthma aggravated, coughing, dyspnea, larynx edema, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis;</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Appendages:</span> acne, angioedema, dermatitis, pruritus, pruritus ani, rash, rash erythematous, rash maculo-papular, skin inflammation, sweating increased, urticaria;</p><p><span class="Italics">Special Senses:</span> otitis media, parosmia, taste loss, taste perversion;</p><p><span class="Italics">Urogenital:</span> abnormal urine, albuminuria, cystitis, dysuria, fungal infection, hematuria, micturition frequency, moniliasis, genital moniliasis, polyuria;</p><p><span class="Italics">Visual:</span> conjunctivitis, vision abnormal.</p><p>The following potentially clinically significant laboratory changes in clinical trials, irrespective of relationship to esomeprazole magnesium, were reported in ≤ 1% of patients: increased creatinine, uric acid, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, serum gastrin, potassium, sodium, thyroxine and thyroid stimulating hormone <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]</span>. Decreases were seen in hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, potassium, sodium, and thyroxine.</p><p>Endoscopic findings that were reported as adverse reactions include: duodenitis, esophagitis, esophageal stricture, esophageal ulceration, esophageal varices, gastric ulcer, gastritis, hernia, benign polyps or nodules, Barrett’s esophagus, and mucosal discoloration.</p><p>The incidence of treatment-related adverse reactions during 6-month maintenance treatment was similar to placebo. There were no differences in types of related adverse reactions seen during maintenance treatment up to 12 months compared to short-term treatment.</p><p>Two placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 710 patients for the treatment of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease. The most common adverse reactions that were reported as possibly or probably related to esomeprazole magnesium were diarrhea (4.3%), headache (3.8%), and abdominal pain (3.8%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Combination Treatment with Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin</span></p><p>In clinical trials using combination therapy with esomeprazole magnesium plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin, no additional adverse reactions specific to these drug combinations were observed. Adverse reactions that occurred were limited to those observed when using esomeprazole magnesium, amoxicillin, or clarithromycin alone.</p><p>The most frequently reported drug-related adverse reactions for patients who received triple therapy for 10 days were diarrhea (9.2%), taste perversion (6.6%), and abdominal pain (3.7%). No treatment-emergent adverse reactions were observed at higher rates with triple therapy than were observed with esomeprazole magnesium alone.</p><p>For more information on adverse reactions with amoxicillin or clarithromycin, refer to their package inserts, Adverse Reactions sections.</p><p>In clinical trials using combination therapy with esomeprazole magnesium plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin, no additional increased laboratory abnormalities particular to these drug combinations were observed.</p><p>For more information on laboratory changes with amoxicillin or clarithromycin, refer to their package inserts, Adverse Reactions section.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of esomeprazole magnesium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reports are listed below by body system:</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood and Lymphatic:</span> agranulocytosis, pancytopenia;</p><p><span class="Italics">Eye:</span> blurred vision;</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal Disorders:</span> pancreatitis, stomatitis, microscopic colitis, <span class="Bold">fundic gland polyps</span>;</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatobiliary:</span> hepatic failure, hepatitis with or without jaundice;</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune System:</span> anaphylactic reaction/shock; systemic lupus erythematosus</p><p><span class="Italics">Infections and Infestations:</span> GI candidiasis; <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile-</span>associated diarrhea;</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders:</span> hypomagnesemia;</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue:</span> muscular weakness, myalgia, bone fracture;</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System:</span> hepatic encephalopathy, taste disturbance;</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric:</span> agression, agitation, depression, hallucination;</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal and Urinary:</span> interstitial nephritis;</p><p><span class="Italics">Reproductive System and Breast:</span> gynecomastia;</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal:</span> bronchospasm;</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue:</span> alopecia, erythema multiforme, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (some fatal), cutaneous lupus erythematosus.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of atazanavir and nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and the development of drug resistance. Coadministration of saquinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to increase saquinavir concentrations, which may increase toxicity and require dose reduction.</p><p>Omeprazole, of which esomeprazole is an enantiomer, has been reported to interact with some antiretroviral drugs. The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known. Increased gastric pH during omeprazole treatment may change the absorption of the antiretroviral drug. Other possible interaction mechanisms are via CYP2C19.</p><p><span class="Italics">Reduced concentrations of atazanavir and nelfinavir</span></p><p>For some antiretroviral drugs, such as atazanavir and nelfinavir, decreased serum levels have been reported when given together with omeprazole. Following multiple doses of nelfinavir (1250 mg, twice daily) and omeprazole (40 mg daily), AUC was decreased by 36% and 92%, C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 37% and 89% and C<span class="Sub">min</span> by 39% and 75%, respectively for nelfinavir and M8. Following multiple doses of atazanavir (400 mg, daily) and omeprazole (40 mg, daily, 2 hr before atazanavir), AUC was decreased by 94%, C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 96%, and C<span class="Sub">min</span> by 95%. Concomitant administration with omeprazole and drugs such as atazanavir and nelfinavir is therefore not recommended.</p><p><span class="Italics">Increased concentrations of saquinavir</span></p><p>For other antiretroviral drugs, such as saquinavir, elevated serum levels have been reported, with an increase in AUC by 82%, in C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 75%, and in C<span class="Sub">min</span> by 106%, following multiple dosing of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg) twice daily for 15 days with omeprazole 40 mg daily coadministered days 11 to 15. Therefore, clinical and laboratory monitoring for saquinavir toxicity is recommended during concurrent use with esomeprazole. Dose reduction of saquinavir should be considered from the safety perspective for individual patients.</p><h3>Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability</h3><p class="First">Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, esomeprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease, while the absorption of drugs such as digoxin can increase during treatment with omeprazole. Esomeprazole is an enantiomer of omeprazole.</p><p>Concomitant treatment with omeprazole (20 mg daily) and digoxin in healthy subjects increased the bioavailability of digoxin by 10% (30% in two subjects). Co-administration of digoxin with esomeprazole strontium is expected to increase the systemic exposure of digoxin. Therefore, patients may need to be monitored when digoxin is taken concomitantly with esomeprazole strontium.</p><p>Co-administration of omeprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving esomeprazole strontium and MMF. Use esomeprazole strontium with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Effects on Hepatic Metabolism/Cytochrome P-450 Pathways</h3><p class="First">Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> studies have shown that esomeprazole is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that esomeprazole does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin,  quinidine, clarithromycin, or amoxicillin.</p><p>Although drug interaction studies have not shown that esomeprazole has a clinically significant interaction with warfarin, post-marketing reports of changes in prothrombin measures have been received among patients on concomitant warfarin and esomeprazole therapy. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time.</p><p>Esomeprazole may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major esomeprazole metabolizing enzyme. Coadministration of esomeprazole 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate, resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam.</p><p>Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of esomeprazole 40 mg results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition. Avoid concomitant administration of esomeprazole strontium with clopidogrel. When using esomeprazole strontium, consider use of alternative anti-platelet therapy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Omeprazole acts as an inhibitor of CYP2C19. Omeprazole, given in doses of 40 mg daily for one week to 20 healthy subjects in cross-over study, increased C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of cilostazol by 18% and 26% respectively. C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of one of its active metabolites, 3,4-dihydrocilostazol, which has 4- 7 times the activity of cilostazol, were increased by 29% and 69% respectively. Coadministration of cilostazol with esomeprazole is expected to increase concentrations of cilostazol and its above mentioned active metabolite. Therefore a dose reduction of cilostazol from 100 mg twice daily to 50 mg twice daily should be considered.</p><p>Concomitant administration of esomeprazole and a combined inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, such as voriconazole, may result in more than doubling of the esomeprazole exposure. Dose adjustment of esomeprazole is not normally required. However, in patients with Zollinger-Ellison’s Syndrome, who may require higher doses up to 240 mg/day, dose adjustment may be considered.</p><p>Drugs known to induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 or both (such as rifampin) may lead to decreased esomeprazole serum levels. Omeprazole, of which esomeprazole is an enantiomer, has been reported to interact with St. John’s Wort, an inducer of CYP3A4. In a cross-over study in 12 healthy male subjects, St. John’s Wort (300 mg three times daily for 14 days) significantly decreased the systemic exposure of omeprazole in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC decreased by 37.5% and 37.9%, respectively) and extensive metabolizers (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC decreased by 49.6 % and 43.9%, respectively). Avoid concomitant use of St. John’s Wort or rifampin with esomeprazole strontium.</p><h3>Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors</h3><p class="First">Drug-induced decrease in gastric acidity results in enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased Chromogranin A levels, which may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Tacrolimus</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration of esomeprazole and tacrolimus may increase the serum levels of tacrolimus.</p><h3>Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of esomeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of esomeprazole and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]</span>.</p><p>Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with other drugs can lead to serious adverse reactions due to drug interactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions in prescribing information for clarithromycin]</span>.

However, no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category C</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no adequate and well controlled studies of esomeprazole strontium delayed-release capsules in pregnant women. Teratogenicity was not observed in an embryofetal developmental study in rats with either esomeprazole strontium or esomeprazole magnesium at equimolar oral doses up to 280 mg esomeprazole/kg/day (about 57 times the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). When administered as either the strontium or magnesium salt, changes in bone morphology and physeal dysplasia were observed in pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity studies in rats at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg esomeprazole/kg/day (approximately 33.6 times the daily MRHD of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). Because of the observed effect at the high doses of esomeprazole strontium on developing bone in rat studies, esomeprazole strontium should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>An embryofetal developmental (teratogenicity) study in rats was performed with both esomeprazole strontium and esomeprazole magnesium at equimolar oral doses of 14 to 280 mg esomeprazole/kg/day (about 3.4 to 57 times the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, on a body surface area basis). At the doses tested, there were no teratogenic or adverse effects on general fetal development or on fetal visceral or skeletal structures. In addition, there was no adverse effect on maternal and fetal bone calcium levels when esomeprazole was administered as either the strontium or magnesium salt.  Fetal exposure to strontium and esomeprazole was dose-related.</p><p>Pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity studies in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate bone development were performed with both esomeprazole strontium and esomeprazole magnesium at equimolar oral doses of 14 to 280 mg esomeprazole/kg/day (about 3.4 to 57 times the daily MRHD of 40 mg of esomeprazole on a body surface area basis). The rats were fed either a standard diet or a diet with reduced levels of calcium and Vitamin D. When administered as either the strontium or magnesium salt, neonatal/early postnatal (birth to weaning) survival was decreased, body weight and body weight gain were reduced and neurobehavioral or general developmental delays in the immediate post-weaning timeframe were evident at doses equal to or greater than 69 mg esomeprazole/kg/day (about 16.8 times the daily MRHD of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). In addition, when administered as either the strontium or magnesium salt, decreased femur length, width and thickness of cortical bone, decreased thickness of the tibial growth plate and minimal to mild bone marrow hypocellularity were noted at doses equal to or greater than 14 mg esomeprazole/kg/day (about 3.4 times the MRHD of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). Physeal dysplasia in the femur was observed in offspring of rats treated with oral doses of esomeprazole (as either the strontium or the magnesium salt) at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 33.6 times the daily MRHD of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). No significant differences were observed between the groups fed nutritionally complete diet and those fed the diet with reduced levels of calcium and Vitamin D.</p><p>Adverse effects on maternal bone were observed in pregnant and lactating rats in the pre- and postnatal toxicity studies when esomeprazole strontium or esomeprazole magnesium were administered at equimolar oral doses of 14 to 280 mg esomeprazole/kg/day (about 3.4 to 57 times the daily MRHD of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). When rats were dosed from gestational day 7 through weaning on postnatal day 21, a statistically significant decrease in maternal femur weight of up to 14% (as compared to placebo treatment) was observed at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg esomeprazole/kg/day (about 33.6 times the daily MRHD of 40 mg on a body surface area basis).</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Limited published data indicate that esomeprazole and strontium are present in human milk. Because of the effect of esomeprazole strontium observed at high doses on developing bone in rat studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of esomeprazole strontium delayed-release capsules have not been established in pediatric patients. Strontium is known to compete with calcium for intestinal absorption and is incorporated into bone. Therefore, use in pediatric patients is not recommended because adequate safety studies have not been performed.</p><p>In a juvenile rat toxicity study, following administration of either esomeprazole strontium or esomeprazole magnesium at equimolar oral doses of 140 to 280 mg esomeprazole/kg/day (34 to 57 times the daily MRHD of 40 mg on a body surface area basis), increases in deaths were seen at the high dose, along with treatment-related decreases in body weight and body weight gain, decreases in femur weight and femur length and decreases in overall growth <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Symptomatic GERD in infants less than one year of age</span></p><p>A pediatric study of esomeprazole magnesium did not establish efficacy for symptomatic GERD in patients less than 1 year of age.

The pharmacokinetics and safety of strontium in patients with severe renal impairment has not been studied and, therefore, use in this patient population is not recommended.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">A single oral dose of esomeprazole at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), was lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity were reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions.</p><p>The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg of esomeprazole were uneventful. Reports of overdosage with omeprazole in humans may also be relevant. Doses ranged up to 2,400 mg (120 times the usual recommended clinical dose). Manifestations were variable, but included confusion, drowsiness, blurred vision, tachycardia, nausea, diaphoresis, flushing, headache, dry mouth, and other adverse reactions similar to those seen in normal clinical experience (see omeprazole package insert - <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions</span>). No specific antidote for esomeprazole is known. Since esomeprazole is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.</p><p>As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered. For current information on treatment of any drug overdose contact a Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2>Esomeprazole Strontium Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">The active ingredient in the proton pump inhibitor esomeprazole strontium delayed-release capsules is bis(5‑ methoxy-2-[(S)-[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1<span class="Italics">H</span>-benzimidazole-1-yl) strontium tetrahydrate. Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole, which is a mixture of the S- and R- isomers.

The 24.65 mg capsule shells have the following inactive ingredients: gelatin, titanium dioxide, synthetic iron oxide. The 49.3 mg capsule shells have the following inactive ingredients: gelatin, titanium dioxide, FD&amp;C Blue #1, FD&amp;C Red #40, FD&amp;C Yellow #6.</p><p>Each 24.65 mg capsule contains 2.6 mg of strontium. Each 49.3 mg capsule contains 5.1 mg of strontium.</p><h2>Esomeprazole Strontium Capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H<span class="Sup">+</span>/K<span class="Sup">+</span>-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. The S- and R-isomers of omeprazole are protonated and converted in the acidic compartment of the parietal cell forming the active inhibitor, the achiral sulphenamide. By acting specifically on the proton pump, esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity. This effect is dose-related up to a daily dose of 20 to 40 mg and leads to inhibition of gastric acid secretion.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Antisecretory Activity</span></p><p>The effect of esomeprazole magnesium on intragastric pH was determined in patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease in two separate studies.

In two 24-month oral carcinogenicity studies in rats, omeprazole at daily doses of 1.7, 3.4, 13.8, 44, and 141 mg/kg/day (about 0.7 to 57 times the human dose of 20 mg/day expressed on a body surface area basis) produced gastric ECL cell carcinoids in a dose-related manner in both male and female rats; the incidence of this effect was markedly higher in female rats, which had higher blood levels of omeprazole. Gastric carcinoids seldom occur in the untreated rat. In addition, ECL cell hyperplasia was present in all treated groups of both sexes. In one of these studies, female rats were treated with 13.8 mg omeprazole/kg/day (about 5.6 times the human dose on a body surface area basis) for 1 year, then followed for an additional year without the drug. No carcinoids were seen in these rats. An increased incidence of treatment-related ECL cell hyperplasia was observed at the end of 1 year (94% treated vs. 10% controls). By the second year the difference between treated and control rats was much smaller (46% vs. 26%) but still showed more hyperplasia in the treated group. Gastric adenocarcinoma was seen in one rat (2%). No similar tumor was seen in male or female rats treated for 2 years. For this strain of rat no similar tumor has been noted historically, but a finding involving only one tumor is difficult to interpret. A 78-week mouse carcinogenicity study of omeprazole did not show increased tumor occurrence, but the study was not conclusive.</p><p>Esomeprazole strontium was negative in the Ames mutation test, in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> rat bone marrow cell chromosome aberration test, and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus test. Esomeprazole magnesium, however, was positive in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test. Omeprazole was positive in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse bone marrow cell chromosome aberration test, and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus test.</p><p>The potential effects of esomeprazole strontium on fertility and reproductive performance were not directly studied. Omeprazole at oral doses up to 138 mg/kg/day in rats (about 33.6 times the daily MRHD of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) was found to have no effect on reproductive performance of parental animals.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">A 28-day toxicity study with a 14-day recovery phase was conducted in juvenile rats with esomeprazole strontium or esomeprazole magnesium at equimolar oral doses of 70 to 280 mg esomeprazole/kg/day (about 17 to 57 times the daily MRHD of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). When administered as either the strontium or magnesium salt from postnatal day 7 through postnatal day 35, the dose of 280 mg esomeprazole/kg/day produced an increase in the number of deaths. In addition, when administered as either the strontium or magnesium salt, doses equal to or greater than 140 mg esomeprazole/kg/day (about 34 times the daily MRHD of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) produced treatment-related decreases in body weight (approximately 14%) and body weight gain, decreases in femur weight and femur length, and affected overall growth.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of esomeprazole strontium has been established based on adequate and well-controlled adult studies of esomeprazole magnesium in the healing and maintenance of erosive esophagitis, symptomatic GERD, risk reduction of NSAID-associated gastric ulcer, <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> eradication to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence, and pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome.

Talk with your doctor.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Esomeprazole strontium can cause serious side effects, including:</span></p><ul>
<li><span class="Bold">A type of kidney problem (acute interstitial nephritis).</span> Some people who take proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medicines, including esomeprazole strontium, may develop a kidney problem called acute interstitial nephritis that can happen at any time during treatment with esomeprazole strontium. Call you doctor if you have a decrease in the amount that you urinate or if you have blood in your urine.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Diarrhea.</span> Esomeprazole strontium may increase your risk of getting severe diarrhea. This diarrhea may be caused by an infection (Clostridium difficile) in your intestines.</li>
</ul><p>Call your doctor right away if you have watery stool, stomach pain, and fever that does not go away.</p><ul>
<li><span class="Bold">Bone fractures.</span> People who take multiple daily doses of PPI medicines for a long period of time (a year or longer) may have an increased risk of fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine.  You should take esomeprazole strontium exactly as prescribed, at the lowest dose possible for your treatment and for the shortest time needed. Talk to your doctor about your risk of bone fracture if you take esomeprazole strontium.

Esomeprazole strontium reduces the amount of acid in your stomach.</p><p>Esomeprazole strontium is used in adults:</p><ul>
<li>for 4 to 8 weeks to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Esomeprazole strontium may also be prescribed to heal acid-related damage to the lining of the esophagus (erosive esophagitis), and to help continue this healing.</li>
</ul><p>GERD happens when acid in your stomach backs up into the tube (esophagus) that connects your mouth to your stomach. This may cause a burning feeling in your chest or throat, sour taste, or burping.</p><ul>
<li>for up to 6 months to reduce the risk of stomach ulcers in some people taking pain medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</li>
<li>to treat patients with a stomach infection (Helicobacter pylori), along with the antibiotics amoxicillin and clarithromycin</li>
<li>for the long-term treatment of conditions where your stomach makes too much acid, including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome is a rare condition in which the stomach produces a more than normal amount of acid.</li>
