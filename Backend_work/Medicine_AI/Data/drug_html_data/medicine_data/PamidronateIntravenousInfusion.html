The recommended dose should be diluted in 1000 mL of sterile 0.45% or 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose injection. This infusion solution is stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature.</p><p><span class="Bold">Paget’s Disease</span></p><p>The recommended daily dose of 30 mg should be diluted in 500 mL of sterile 0.45% or 0.9% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose injection and administered over a 4-hour period daily for 3 consecutive days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer</span></p><p>The recommended dose of 90 mg should be diluted in 250 mL of sterile 0.45% or 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose injection and administered over a 2-hour period once every 3 to 4 weeks.</p><p><span class="Bold">Osteolytic Bone Lesions of Multiple Myeloma</span></p><p>The recommended dose of 90 mg should be diluted in 500 mL of sterile 0.45% or 0.9% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose injection, and administered over a 4-hour period every four weeks.</p><h3>Incompatibilities, Inspection before Use</h3><p class="First">Pamidronate disodium injection must not be mixed with calcium-containing infusion solutions such as Ringer’s solution. Administer as a single intravenous solution and infuse using an intravenous line reserved for pamidronate alone.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Injection: 30 mg/10 mL solution in single-use vial</p><p>Injection: 90 mg/10 mL solution in single-use vial</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Pamidronate disodium is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to pamidronate disodium, other bisphosphonates, or mannitol. Reactions to pamidronate disodium injection and to mannitol have included anaphylaxis.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Deterioration in Renal Function, Use in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate disodium, have been associated with renal toxicity, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. This toxicity has been manifested as nephritic syndrome, deterioration of renal function, and renal failure. Renal failure has been reported in patients after a single dose of pamidronate disodium. Some patients had gradual improvement in renal status after pamidronate disodium was discontinued.</p><p>Do not administer single doses of pamidronate disodium in excess of 90 mg due to the risk of clinically significant deterioration in renal function, <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span><span class="Bold">.</span></p><p>Assess serum creatinine prior to each treatment. Withhold treatment until renal function returns to baseline in patients who show evidence of deterioration in renal function. Do not administer pamidronate in patients with severe renal impairment for the treatment of bone metastases <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)].</span></p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate disodium, are incorporated into the bone matrix, and gradually released over periods of weeks to years. Pamidronate disodium may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in rats and rabbits, pamidronate doses equivalent to 0.6 to 8.3 times the highest human recommended dose resulted in maternal toxicity and embryo/fetal effects.</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of pamidronate disodium in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><h3>Electrolyte Disorders</h3><p class="First">Cases of asymptomatic hypophosphatemia (12%), hypokalemia (7%), hypomagnesemia (11%), and hypocalcemia (5% to 17%), were reported in pamidronate disodium-treated patients. Rare cases of symptomatic hypocalcemia (including tetany) have been reported in association with pamidronate disodium therapy. Monitor serum levels of calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and potassium, following initiation of therapy with pamidronate disodium. If hypocalcemia occurs, short-term calcium therapy may be necessary. In the absence of hypercalcemia, supplement with oral calcium and vitamin D in order to minimize the risk of hypocalcemia.</p><h3>Osteonecrosis of the Jaw</h3><p class="First">Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including pamidronate disodium. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids, which may be risk factors for ONJ. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of ONJ with certain tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Local infection including osteomyelitis has been reported with ONJ.</p><p>Patients receiving pamidronate should maintain good oral hygiene and have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>While on treatment, avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Atypical Fractures of the Femur</h3><p class="First">Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including pamidronate disodium. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore, the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures also has been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were receiving treatment also with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established.</p><p>Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be evaluated for an atypical fracture. Consider discontinuation of pamidronate disodium therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:</p><ul class="Disk">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hypercalcemia of Malignancy</span></p><p>Transient mild elevation of temperature by at least 1°C was noted 24 to 48 hours after administration of pamidronate disodium in 34% of patients in clinical trials. Local soft-tissue reactions (redness, swelling or induration and pain on palpation) at the site of catheter insertion were observed, most commonly in patients treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium. Symptomatic treatment resulted in rapid resolution in all patients.</p><p>Rare cases of uveitis, iritis, scleritis, and episcleritis have been reported, including one case of scleritis and one case of uveitis upon separate rechallenges.</p><p>Five of 231 patients (2%) who received pamidronate disodium while enrolled on controlled clinical trials for management of hypercalcemia were reported to have seizures, including two patients with pre-existing seizure disorders. One patient on the control (saline arm) also had a seizure. At least 15% of patients treated with pamidronate disodium for hypercalcemia of malignancy experienced the following adverse reactions during a clinical trial:</p><p><span class="Bold"><span

resulted in discontinuation of therapy.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval pamidronate sodium use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>General: reactivation of Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster, influenza-like symptoms</p><p>CNS: confusion and visual hallucinations, sometimes in the presence of electrolyte imbalance;</p><p>Skin: rash, pruritus</p><p>Special senses: conjunctivitis, orbital inflammation;</p><p>Renal and urinary disorders: focal segmental glomerulosclerosis including the collapsing variant, nephrotic syndrome; renal tubular disorders (RTD); tubulointerstitial nephritis, and glomerulonephropathies.</p><p>Laboratory abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hematuria. Rare instances of allergic manifestations have been reported, including hypotension, dyspnea, or angioedema, and, very rarely, anaphylactic shock.

Pamidronate disodium may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate disodium, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the total dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Although there are no data on fetal risk in humans, bisphosphonates do cause fetal harm in animals, and animal data suggest that uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone is greater than into maternal bone. Therefore, there is a theoretical risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. The impact of variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to conception, the particular bisphosphonate used, and the route of administration (intravenous versus oral) on this risk has not been established. If pamidronate disodium is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking or after taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Intravenous bolus dosing of pregnant rats and rabbits with pamidronate resulted in maternal toxicity and embryo/fetal effects when given during organogenesis at doses of 0.6 to 8.3 times the highest recommended human dose for a single intravenous infusion. Pamidronate can cross the placenta in rats, and has produced marked maternal and nonteratogenic embryo/fetal effects in both rats and rabbits.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether pamidronate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from pamidronate disodium, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of pamidronate disodium in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of pamidronate disodium, approximately 20% were 65 and over, while approximately 15% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Females of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Contraception</span></p><p>Pamidronate disodium may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant while taking pamidronate disodium. Since pamidronate disodium is incorporated into bone and is gradually released over periods of weeks to years, advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus if pregnancy occurs after completing treatment with this drug. If contraceptive methods are being considered, use effective contraception while taking and after taking pamidronate disodium. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking or after taking pamidronate disodium <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The renal clearance of pamidronate was reduced in patients with reduced creatinine clearance. Because pamidronate disodium is administered on a monthly basis, drug accumulation is not expected. No changes in pamidronate disodium dosing regimen are recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min). Limited pharmacokinetic data exist in patients with creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with moderate hepatic impairment exhibited higher mean pamidronate AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>. Because pamidronate disodium is administered on a monthly basis, drug accumulation is not expected. No changes in pamidronate disodium dosing regimen are recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Pamidronate disodium has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Several cases of drug overdose have been reported in hypercalcemia patients treated with total doses of 225 mg to 300 mg pamidronate disodium given over 2.5 to 4 days. All patients survived, but all developed hypocalcemia that required intravenous and/or oral administration of calcium. If overdosage occurs, treat symptomatic hypocalcemia patients with short-term intravenous calcium.</p><p>Single doses of pamidronate disodium should not exceed 90 mg, and the duration of the intravenous infusion should be no less than 2 hours <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span><span class="Bold">.</span></p><p>In addition, one obese woman (95 kg) who was treated with 285 mg of pamidronate disodium/day for 3 days experienced high fever (39.5°C), hypotension (from 170/90 mmHg to 90/60 mmHg), and transient taste perversion, occurring about 6 hours after the first infusion. Fever and hypotension rapidly reversed with steroid therapy.</p><h2>Pamidronate Intravenous Infusion Description</h2><p class="First">Pamidronate disodium injection is a sterile bisphosphonate available in 30 mg or 90 mg vials for intravenous administration. Each mL of the 30 mg vial contains: 3 mg pamidronate disodium; 47 mg mannitol USP; water for injection, USP, q.s.; phosphoric acid to adjust pH 6.5. Each mL of the 90 mg vial contains: 9 mg pamidronate disodium; 37.5 mg mannitol USP; water for injection, USP, q.s.; phosphoric acid to adjust pH to 6.5.</p><p>The pH of a 1% solution of pamidronate disodium in distilled water is approximately 8.3. Pamidronate disodium, a member of the group of chemical compounds known as bisphosphonates, is an analog of pyrophosphate. Pamidronate disodium is designated chemically as phosphonic acid (3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene) bis-, disodium salt, pentahydrate, and its structural formula is:</p><p>C<span class="Sub">3</span>H<span class="Sub">9</span>NO<span class="Sub">7</span>P<span class="Sub">2</span>Na<span class="Sub">2</span>•5H<span class="Sub">2</span>O M.W. 369.1</p><p>Pamidronate disodium is a white to practically white powder. It is soluble in water and in 2N sodium hydroxide, sparingly soluble in 0.1N hydrochloric acid and in 0.1N acetic acid, and practically insoluble in organic solvents.</p><h2>Pamidronate Intravenous Infusion - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The principal pharmacologic action of pamidronate disodium is inhibition of bone resorption. Although the mechanism of antiresorptive action is not completely understood, several factors are thought to contribute to this action. Pamidronate disodium adsorbs to calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) crystals in bone and may block dissolution of this mineral component of bone. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, pamidronate disodium inhibited osteoclast activity. In animal studies, pamidronate disodium inhibited bone resorption, but did not inhibit bone formation and mineralization. In animal tumor models, pamidronate disodium inhibited the increased osteoclast activity induced by tumors.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Serum phosphate levels have been noted to decrease after administration of pamidronate disodium, presumably because of decreased release of phosphate from bone and increased renal excretion as parathyroid hormone levels, which are usually suppressed in hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, return toward normal. Phosphate therapy was administered in 30% of the patients in response to a decrease in serum phosphate levels. Phosphate levels usually returned toward normal within 7 to 10 days.</p><p>Urinary calcium/creatinine and urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratios decrease and usually return to within or below normal after treatment with pamidronate disodium. These changes occur within the first week after treatment, as do decreases in serum calcium levels, and are consistent with an antiresorptive pharmacologic action.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Table 3 shows maximum concentration, percent of dose excreted in urine, total clearance, and renal clearance of pamidronate after an intravenous infusion of 30, 60, or 90 mg of pamidronate disodium over 4 hours and 90 mg of pamidronate disodium over 24 hours in cancer patients (n=24) who had minimal or no bony involvement.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3 Mean (Standard Deviation, CV%) Pamidronate Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Cancer Patients (n=6 for each group)</span></p><p class="First">30 mg</p><p class="First">0.73</p><p class="First">43.9</p><p class="First">136</p><p class="First">58</p><p class="First">(4 hrs)</p><p class="First">(0.14, 19.1%)</p><p class="First">(14, 31.9%)</p><p class="First">(44, 32.4%)</p><p class="First">(27, 46.5%)</p><p class="First">60 mg</p><p class="First">1.44</p><p class="First">47.4</p><p class="First">88</p><p class="First">42</p><p class="First">(4 hrs)</p><p class="First">(0.57, 39.6%)</p><p class="First">(47.4, 54.4%)</p><p class="First">(56, 63.6%)</p><p class="First">(28, 66.7%)</p><p class="First">90 mg</p><p class="First">2.61</p><p class="First">45.3</p><p class="First">103</p><p class="First">44</p><p class="First">(4 hrs)</p><p class="First">(0.74, 28.3%)</p><p class="First">(25.8, 56.9%)</p><p class="First">(37, 35.9%)</p><p class="First">(16, 36.4%)</p><p class="First">90 mg</p><p class="First">1.38</p><p class="First">47.5</p><p class="First">101</p><p class="First">52</p><p class="First">(24 hrs)</p><p class="First">(1.97, 142.7%)</p><p class="First">(10.2, 21.5%)</p><p class="First">(58, 57.4%)</p><p class="First">(42, 80.8%)</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The body retention of pamidronate was 54 ± 16% (mean ± standard deviation) of the dose over 120 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Pamidronate is not metabolized.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>The elimination half-life is 28 ± 7 hours (mean ± standard deviation).

Although there was a difference in the pharmacokinetics between patients with normal and impaired hepatic function, the difference was not considered clinically relevant. Patients with hepatic impairment exhibited higher mean AUC (53% increase) and C<span class="Sub">max</span> (29% increase), and decreased plasma clearance (33% decrease) values. Because pamidronate disodium is administered on a monthly basis, drug accumulation is not expected.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">In a 104-week carcinogenicity study with daily oral administration of pamidronate in rats, there was a positive dose-response relationship for benign adrenal pheochromocytoma. The lowest daily dose associated with adrenal pheochromocytoma resulted in systemic exposures that were similar to the systemic exposure achieved in patients at the intended clinical dose. Adrenal pheochromocytoma also was observed in low numbers in the control animals and is considered a relatively common spontaneous neoplasm in the rat. Pamidronate given daily by oral administration was not carcinogenic in an 80 week study in mice.</p><p>Pamidronate did not cause genetic toxicity in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, nucleus-anomaly test, sister-chromatid-exchange study, point-mutation test and micronucleus test in the rat.</p><p>In rats, decreased fertility occurred in first-generation offspring of parents who had received 150 mg/kg of pamidronate orally; however, this occurred only when animals were mated with members of the same dose group.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">After intravenous administration of radiolabeled pamidronate in rats, approximately 50% to 60% of the compound was rapidly adsorbed by bone and slowly eliminated from the body by the kidneys. In rats given 10 mg/kg bolus injections of radiolabeled pamidronate disodium, approximately 30% of the compound was found in the liver shortly after administration and was then redistributed to bone or eliminated by the kidneys over 24 to 48 hours. Studies in rats injected with radiolabeled pamidronate disodium showed that the compound was rapidly cleared from the circulation and taken up mainly by bones, liver, spleen, teeth, and tracheal cartilage. Radioactivity was eliminated from most soft tissues within 1 to 4 days; was detectable in liver and spleen for 1 and 3 months, respectively; and remained high in bones, trachea, and teeth for 6 months after dosing. Bone uptake occurred preferentially in areas of high bone turnover. The terminal phase of elimination half-life in bone was estimated to be approximately 300 days.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Hypercalcemia of Malignancy</h3><p class="First">In one double-blind clinical trial, 52 patients who had hypercalcemia of malignancy received 30 mg, 60 mg, or 90 mg of pamidronate disodium as a single 24-hour intravenous infusion if their corrected serum calcium levels were ≥ 12 mg/dL after 48-hours of saline hydration (See Table 4).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4: Comparison of Calcium Normalization Following a 24-hour Infusion of Pamidronate Disodium</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pamidronate Disodium</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">30 mg</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">60 mg</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">90 mg</span></p><p class="First">Mean Baseline Corrected Serum Calcium (after 48 hours saline hydration)</p><p class="First">13.8 mg/dL</p><p class="First">13.8 mg/dL</p><p class="First">13.3 mg/dL</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">% Patients with Normalized Serum Calcium (N=52)</span></p><p class="First">Day 7</p><p class="First">41%</p><p class="First">61%</p><p class="First">100%</p><p class="First">Day 14</p><p class="First">----</p><p class="First">33%</p><p class="First">53%</p><p>In a second double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 65 cancer patients who had corrected serum calcium levels of ≥12 mg/dL after at least 24-hours of saline hydration were randomized to receive either 60 mg of pamidronate disodium as a single 24-hour intravenous infusion or 7.5 mg/kg of etidronate disodium as a 2-hour intravenous infusion daily for 3 days.

SREs were defined as the occurrence of new or additional pathologic fractures, radiation therapy or surgery for bony fracture, impending fracture, or spinal cord compression. Pamidronate disodium 90 mg or placebo was administered as a 4-hour infusion every 4 weeks for 9 months. Of the 392 patients enrolled, 377 were evaluable for efficacy.
