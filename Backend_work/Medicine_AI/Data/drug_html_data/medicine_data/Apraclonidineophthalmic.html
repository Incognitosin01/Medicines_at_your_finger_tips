Do not use  apraclonidine ophthalmic in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Apraclonidine ophthalmic is usually given as 1 to 2 drops in each affected eye, 3 times per day.

<li>
<p>Tilt your head back slightly and pull down your lower eyelid to create a small pocket. Hold the dropper above the eye with the tip down. Look up and away from the dropper and squeeze out a drop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close your eyes for 2 or 3 minutes with your head tipped down, without blinking or squinting. Gently press your finger to the inside corner of the eye for about 1 minute, to keep the liquid from draining into your tear duct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use only the number of drops your doctor has prescribed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait at least 5 minutes before using any other eye drops your doctor has prescribed.</p>
