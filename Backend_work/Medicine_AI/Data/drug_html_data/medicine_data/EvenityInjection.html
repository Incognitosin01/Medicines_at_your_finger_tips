</ul><h2>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE)</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">In a randomized controlled trial in postmenopausal women, there was a higher rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, in patients treated with EVENITY compared to those treated with alendronate <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Boxed Warning</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. </span></p><p>EVENITY should not be initiated in patients who have had a myocardial infarction or stroke within the preceding year. Consider whether the benefits outweigh the risks in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Monitor for signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction and stroke and instruct patients to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms occur. If a patient experiences a myocardial infarction or stroke during therapy, EVENITY should be discontinued.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, erythema multiforme, dermatitis, rash, and urticaria have occurred in EVENITY-treated patients. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy and discontinue further use of EVENITY <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">) and Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.1</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>Hypocalcemia</h3><p class="First">Hypocalcemia has occurred in patients receiving EVENITY. Correct hypocalcemia prior to initiating EVENITY <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">),</span> <span class="Italics">Adverse</span> <span class="Italics">Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.1</span><span class="Italics">)</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Use in Specific</span> <span class="Italics">Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.7</span><span class="Italics">)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p>Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D while on EVENITY <span class="Italics">[</span><span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2.2</span><span class="Italics">) and</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">14.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p>Patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) or receiving dialysis are at greater risk of developing hypocalcemia. Monitor serum calcium and adequately supplement patients who have severe renal impairment or are receiving dialysis with calcium and vitamin D. Instruct patients with severe renal impairment, including those receiving dialysis, about the symptoms of hypocalcemia and the importance of maintaining calcium levels with adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation.</p><h3>Osteonecrosis of the Jaw</h3><p class="First">Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients receiving EVENITY. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of EVENITY treatment. Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ (chemotherapy, bisphosphonates, denosumab, angiogenesis inhibitors, and corticosteroids) may increase the risk of developing ONJ. Other risk factors for ONJ include cancer, radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, and coagulopathy<span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. </p><p>For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on benefit-risk assessment. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on EVENITY should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon. In these patients, dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of EVENITY should be considered based on benefit-risk assessment.</p><h3>Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures</h3><p class="First">Atypical low-energy or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in patients receiving EVENITY <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated.</p><p>Atypical femoral fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs.</p><p>During EVENITY treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of EVENITY therapy should be considered based on benefit-risk assessment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (</span><span class="Italics">14</span><span class="Italics">)]</span><span class="Italics">.</span></p><h2>6 ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:</span></p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety of EVENITY for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 1, NCT01575834) of 7180 postmenopausal women aged 55 to 90 years (mean age of 71 years). A total of 3581 and 3576 women received at least one dose of EVENITY and placebo, respectively, administered once every month during the 12-month double-blind study period. Women received at least 500 mg calcium and 600 international units of vitamin D supplementation daily and 77% received a loading dose of 50,000 to 60,000 international units of vitamin D within one week of randomization (if serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were 40 ng/mL or less).</p><p>The safety of EVENITY for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in patients at high risk of fracture was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, alendronate-controlled study (Study 2, NCT01631214) of 4093 postmenopausal women aged 55 to 90 years (mean age of 74 years). A total of 2040 and 2014 women received at least one dose of EVENITY and alendronate, respectively, during the 12-month double-blind study period. Women received at least 500 mg calcium and 600 international units vitamin D supplementation daily and 74% received a loading dose of 50,000 to 60,000 international units of vitamin D within one week of randomization (if serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were 40 ng/mL or less).</p><p>In Study 1, during the 12-month double-blind treatment period, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.7% (24/3576) in the placebo group and 0.8% (29/3581) in the EVENITY group. The incidence of nonfatal serious adverse events was 8.3% in the placebo group and 9.1% in the EVENITY group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 1.1% in the placebo group and 1.1% in the EVENITY group. The most common adverse reactions reported with EVENITY (greater than or equal to 5% and at a higher incidence than placebo) were arthralgia and headache.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other romosozumab products may be misleading.</p><p>The immunogenicity of EVENITY was evaluated using an immunoassay for the detection of anti-romosozumab-aqqg<span class="Italics"> </span>antibodies. An <span class="Italics">in vitro</span><span class="Italics"> </span>biological<span class="Italics"> </span>assay was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies for those subjects whose sera tested positive for anti-romosozumab-aqqg antibodies.</p><p>Among 5914 postmenopausal women treated with EVENITY 210 mg monthly, 18.1% of subjects developed antibodies to romosozumab-aqqg. Of the subjects who developed antibodies to romosozumab-aqqg, 4.7% had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. Development of antibodies to romosozumab-aqqg was associated with lower serum romosozumab-aqqg concentrations <span class="Italics">[</span><span class="Italics">see</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">12.3</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.

EVENITY increases bone formation and, to a lesser extent, decreases bone resorption. Animal studies showed that romosozumab-aqqg stimulates new bone formation on trabecular and cortical bone surfaces by stimulating osteoblastic activity resulting in increases in trabecular and cortical bone mass and improvements in bone structure and strength <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (</span><span class="Italics">13.2</span><span class="Italics">) and Clinical Studies (</span><span class="Italics">14.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. </span></p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, EVENITY increased the bone formation marker procollagen type 1 N-telopeptide (P1NP) with a peak increase from baseline of approximately 145% compared to placebo 2 weeks after initiating treatment, followed by a return to concentrations seen with placebo at month 9 and a decline from baseline to approximately 15% below the concentration change seen with placebo at month 12.</p><p>EVENITY decreased the bone resorption marker type 1 collagen C-telopeptide (CTX) with a maximal reduction from baseline of approximately 55% compared to placebo 2 weeks after initiating treatment. CTX remained below concentrations seen with placebo and was approximately 25% below the concentration change seen with placebo at month 12.</p><p>After discontinuation of EVENITY, P1NP levels returned to baseline within 12 months; CTX increased above baseline levels within 3 months and returned toward baseline levels by month 12.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Administration of a single dose of 210 mg EVENITY in healthy volunteers resulted in a mean (standard deviation [SD]) maximum romosozumab-aqqg serum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of 22.2 (5.8) mcg/mL and a mean (SD) AUC of 389 (127) mcg*day/mL. Steady-state concentrations were achieved by month 3 following the monthly administration of 210 mg to postmenopausal women. The mean trough serum romosozumab-aqqg concentrations at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 ranged from 8 to 13 mcg/mL.</p><p>Romosozumab-aqqg exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics with exposure increasing greater than dose proportionally (e.g., 550-fold increase in mean AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span> for the 100-fold increase in subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg [0.03 to 3.3 times the approved recommended dosage for a 70 kg woman). </p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>The median time to maximum romosozumab-aqqg concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) is 5 days (range: 2 to 7 days).</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The estimated volume of distribution at steady-state is approximately 3.92 L.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimina</span><span class="Bold">t</span><span class="Bold">ion</span></p><p>Romosozumab-aqqg exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics with the clearance of romosozumab-aqqg decreasing as the dose increased. The estimated mean systemic clearance (CL/F) of romosozumab-aqqg was 0.38 mL/hr/kg, following a single subcutaneous administration of 3 mg/kg (the approved recommended dosage for a 70 kg woman). The mean effective t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> was 12.8 days after 3 doses of 3 mg/kg (the approved recommended dosage for a 70 kg woman) every 4 weeks.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>The metabolic pathway of romosozumab-aqqg has not been characterized.

The presence of anti-romosozumab-aqqg antibodies led to decreased mean romosozumab-aqqg concentrations up to 22%. The presence of neutralizing antibodies led to decreased mean romosozumab-aqqg concentrations up to 63%<span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span><span class="Italics">.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Specific</span> <span class="Bold">Populations</span></p><p>No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of romosozumab-aqqg were observed based on age (20-89 years), sex, race, disease state (low bone mass or osteoporosis), prior exposure to alendronate, or renal impairment including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis.

Romosozumab-aqqg caused a dose-dependent increase in bone mass with trabecular and cortical bone thickening at all doses. There were no effects of romosozumab-aqqg on mortality and romosozumab-aqqg did not cause significant increases in tumor incidence in male or female rats.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenicity</span></p><p>Mutagenesis has not been evaluated, as monoclonal antibodies are not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>No effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats given subcutaneous romosozumab-aqqg doses up to 300 mg/kg (up to 54 times the systemic exposure observed in humans following a monthly subcutaneous dose of 210 mg EVENITY, based on AUC comparison). No effects were noted in reproductive organs in rats and cynomolgus monkeys dosed subcutaneously for 6 months with weekly doses up to 100 mg/kg (exposures up to 37 and 90 times, respectively, the systemic exposure observed in humans administered monthly subcutaneous doses of 210 mg based on AUC comparison).</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">No adverse effects were noted in rats and monkeys after 26 once-weekly subcutaneous romosozumab-aqqg doses up to 100 mg/kg, equivalent to systemic exposures of 37 and 90 times, respectively, the systemic exposure observed in humans following a monthly subcutaneous dose of 210 mg EVENITY (based on AUC comparison).</p><p>Bone safety studies of up to 12-month duration were conducted in ovariectomized rats and monkeys with once-weekly romosozumab-aqqg doses yielding exposures ranging from 1 to 21 times the systemic exposure in humans given monthly doses of 210 mg, based on AUC comparison. Romosozumab-aqqg increased bone mass and improved cancellous bone microarchitecture and cortical bone geometry by increasing bone formation on periosteal, endocortical, and trabecular surfaces, and decreasing bone resorption on trabecular and endocortical surfaces. The increases in bone mass were significantly correlated with increases in bone strength. In rats and monkeys, bone quality was maintained at all skeletal sites at doses ranging from 1 to 21 times human exposure, and slightly improved in vertebrae at 19 to 21 times human exposure. There was no evidence of mineralization defects, osteoid accumulation, or woven bone formation.  </p><h2>14 CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><h3>Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Study</span> <span class="Bold">1</span> (NCT01575834) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of postmenopausal women aged 55 to 90 years (mean age of 71 years) with bone mineral density (BMD) T-score less than or equal to −2.5 at the total hip or femoral neck. Women were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either EVENITY (N = 3589) or placebo (N = 3591) for 12 months. At baseline, 18% of women had a vertebral fracture.

At month 2 in women treated with EVENITY, histomorphometric indices of bone formation at trabecular and endocortical surfaces were increased. These effects on bone formation were accompanied by a decrease in indices of bone resorption.
