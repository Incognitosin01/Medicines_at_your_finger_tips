The fluoride ion reacts with the <span class="Italics">hydroxyapatite</span> in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, <span class="Italics">fluorapatite</span>. The reaction may be expressed by the equation:</p><p></p><p>Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished:</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Tri-Vitamin Drops with Iron and Fluoride</h2><p class="First">Vitamins A, C, D, Iron and Fluoride Drops may be useful for infants and children whose diets are lacking in vitamins A, C, D and iron.</p><p>Vitamins A, C, D, Iron and Fluoride Drops also provide fluoride for caries prophylaxis.</p><p>Vitamins A, C, D, Iron and Fluoride Drops were developed to provide fluoride in drop form for infants and young children 6 months to 3 years of age, in areas where the drinking water contains less than 0.3 ppm of fluoride; and for children ages 3-6 years in areas where the drinking water containes 0.3 thru 0.6 ppm of fluoride. Each 1.0 mL supplies sodium fluoride (0.25 mg fluoride) plus three basic vitamins and iron.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span></p><p>Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. <span class="Bold">KEEP THIS PRODUCT OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.</span> In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or Poison Control Center immediately.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">The suggested dose should not be exceeded since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride.</p><p>When prescribing Vitamin A, C, D, Iron and Fluoride Drops:</p><p>Vitamins A, C, D, Iron and Fluoride Drops should be dispensed in the original plastic container, since contact with glass leads to instability and precipitation. (The amount of sodium fluoride in the 50 mL size is well below the maximum to be dispensed at one time according to recommendations of the American Dental Association.)</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Allergic rash and other idiosyncrasies have been rarely reported.
