</ul><p class="First"> </p><h2>Indications and Usage for Pioglitazone Tablets</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Monotherapy and Combination Therapy</span><br/>
<br/>
Pioglitazone Tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus in multiple clinical settings <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Important Limitations of Use</span><br/>
<br/>
Pioglitazone Tablets exert its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin. Pioglitazone Tablets should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings.<br/>
<br/>
Use caution in patients with liver disease <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Pioglitazone Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommendations for All Patients</h3><p class="First">Pioglitazone Tablets should be taken once daily and can be taken without regard to meals.<br/>
<br/>
The recommended starting dose for patients without congestive heart failure is 15 mg or 30 mg once daily.<br/>
<br/>
The recommended starting dose for patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA Class I or II) is 15 mg once daily.<br/>
<br/>
The dose can be titrated in increments of 15 mg up to a maximum of 45 mg once daily based on glycemic response as determined by HbA1c.<br/>
<br/>
After initiation of Pioglitazone Tablets or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating Pioglitazone Tablets. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with Pioglitazone Tablets are not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of Pioglitazone Tablets or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking Pioglitazone Tablets should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue or Insulin</h3><p class="First">If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient co-administered Pioglitazone Tablets and an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea), the dose of the insulin secretagogue should be reduced.<br/>
<br/>
If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient co-administered Pioglitazone Tablets and insulin, the dose of insulin should be decreased by 10% to 25%. Further adjustments to the insulin dose should be individualized based on glycemic response.</p><h3>Concomitant Use with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of Pioglitazone Tablets and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of Pioglitazone Tablets are 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span> </p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Congestive Heart Failure</h3><p class="First">Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone must be considered <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4)</span>, <span class="Italics">and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving pioglitazone in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Effects</h3><p class="First">There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone should be initiated with caution.<br/>
<br/>
Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.<br/>
<br/>
Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone can be used with caution.</p><h3>Urinary Bladder Tumors</h3><p class="First">Tumors were observed <span class="following_xmChange">in</span> the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span> In addition, during the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1; [95% CI: 0.59 to 1.72]).</p><p>Findings regarding <span class="following_xmChange">the</span> risk of bladder cancer in patients exposed to pioglitazone vary among observational studies; some did not find an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone, while others did.</p><p>A <span class="following_xmChange">large</span> prospective 10-year observational cohort study conducted in the United States found no statistically significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients ever exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed to pioglitazone (HR =1.06 [95% CI 0.89 to 1.26]).</p><p>A retrospective cohort <span class="following_xmChange">study</span> conducted with data from the United Kingdom found a statistically significant association between ever exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer (HR: 1.63; [95% CI: 1.22 to 2.19]).</p><p>Associations between cumulative dose <span class="following_xmChange">or</span> cumulative duration of exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer were not detected in some studies including the 10-year observational study in the U.S., but were in others. Inconsistent findings and limitations inherent in these and other studies preclude conclusive interpretations of the observational data.</p><p>Pioglitazone <span class="following_xmChange">may</span> be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors. There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors.</p><p>Consequently, pioglitazone should <span class="following_xmChange">not</span> be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with pioglitazone should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer.</p><h3>Edema</h3><p class="First">In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received.<br/>
<br/>
Pioglitazone should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Fractures</h3><p class="First">In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care.</p><h3>Macular Edema</h3><p class="First">Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination.<br/>
<br/>
Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione.<br/>
<br/>
Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Macrovascular Outcomes</h3><p class="First">There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.<br/>
<br/>
Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone in the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for six months or longer, over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for one year or longer, and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for at least two years.<br/>
<br/>
In six pooled 16- to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16- to 24-week add-on combination therapy trials, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control, although the incidence of these events was lower (1.5%) with pioglitazone than with placebo (3%).<br/>
<br/>
In the PROactive trial, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients. Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo.<br/>

<br/>
In the PROactive trial, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months.<br/>
<br/>
The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio 0.9; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.8, 1.02; p=0.1).<br/>
<br/>
Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the three-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 9.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular Events</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span><br/>

<br/>
There has been no evidence of induced hepatotoxicity with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date. One randomized, double-blind 3-year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hypoglycemia</span></span><br/>
<br/>
In the pioglitazone clinical trials, adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing.<br/>
<br/>
In the 16-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16-week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg, and 4.8% with placebo.<br/>
<br/>
The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone 45 mg compared to pioglitazone 30 mg in both the 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% vs. 13.4%) and in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% vs. 43.5%).<br/>
<br/>
Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patient’s usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (n=2) or pioglitazone 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (n=12).<br/>

<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Urinary Bladder Tumors</span></span></p><p>Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>. During the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1; 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.72) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.<br/>

<span class="Bold">Laboratory Abnormalities</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Hematologic Effects</span><br/>
<br/>
Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first 4 to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Creatine Phosphokinase</span><br/>
<br/>
During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing and one patient discontinued pioglitazone due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pioglitazone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration.<br/>
<br/>
In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials.

<br/>
Pioglitazone is not recommended for use in pediatric patients based on adverse effects observed in adults, including fluid retention and congestive heart failure, fractures, and urinary bladder tumors <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">A total of 92 patients (15.2%) treated with pioglitazone in the three pooled 16- to 26-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, monotherapy trials were ≥65 years old and two patients (0.3%) were ≥75 years old. In the two pooled 16- to 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trials, 201 patients (18.7%) treated with pioglitazone were ≥ 65 years old and 19 (1.8%) were ≥ 75 years old. In the two pooled 16- to 24-week add-on to metformin trials, 155 patients (15.5%) treated with pioglitazone were ≥65 years old and 19 (1.9%) were ≥75 years old. In the two pooled 16- to 24-week add-on to insulin trials, 272 patients (25.4%) treated with pioglitazone were ≥65 years old and 22 (2.1%) were ≥75 years old.<br/>
<br/>
In PROactive, 1068 patients (41%) treated with pioglitazone were ≥65 years old and 42 (1.6%) were ≥75 years old.<br/>
<br/>
In pharmacokinetic studies with pioglitazone, no significant differences were observed in pharmacokinetic parameters between elderly and younger patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Although clinical experiences have not identified differences in effectiveness and safety between the elderly (<span class="Bold">&gt;</span>65 years) and younger patients, these conclusions are limited by small sample sizes for patients <span class="Bold">&gt;</span>75 years old.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">During controlled clinical trials, one case of overdose with pioglitazone was reported. A male patient took 120 mg per day for four days, then 180 mg per day for seven days. The patient denied any clinical symptoms during this period.<br/>
<br/>
In the event of overdosage, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient’s clinical signs and symptoms.</p><h2>Pioglitazone Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Pioglitazone Tablets are a thiazolidinedione and an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma that contains an oral antidiabetic medication: pioglitazone.<br/>
<br/>
Pioglitazone [(±)-5-[[4-[2-(5-ethyl-2-pyridinyl) ethoxy] phenyl] methyl]-2,4-] thiazolidinedione monohydrochloride contains one asymmetric carbon, and the compound is synthesized and used as the racemic mixture. The two enantiomers of pioglitazone interconvert <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>. No differences were found in the pharmacologic activity between the two enantiomers. The structural formula is as shown:</p><p>Pioglitazone hydrochloride USP is an off-white to pale yellow color powder that has a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">19</span>H<span class="Sub">20</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>S•HCl and a molecular weight of 392.90 daltons. It is soluble in <span class="Italics">N,N</span>- dimethylformamide, slightly soluble in anhydrous ethanol, very slightly soluble in acetone and acetonitrile, practically insoluble in water, and insoluble in ether.<br/>
<br/>
Pioglitazone is available as a tablet for oral administration containing 15 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg of pioglitazone (as the base) formulated with the following excipients: carboxymethylcellulose calcium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose monohydrate, and magnesium stearate.</p><h2>Pioglitazone Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin- dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.<br/>
<br/>
Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies demonstrate that pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients. Pioglitazone enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal and improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the decreased insulin resistance produced by pioglitazone results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin concentrations, and lower HbA1c values. In controlled clinical trials, pioglitazone had an additive effect on glycemic control when used in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span><br/>
<br/>
Patients with lipid abnormalities were included in clinical trials with pioglitazone. Overall, patients treated with pioglitazone had mean decreases in serum triglycerides, mean increases in HDL cholesterol, and no consistent mean changes in LDL and total cholesterol. There is no conclusive evidence of macrovascular benefit with pioglitazone <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span><br/>
<br/>
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging monotherapy study, mean serum triglycerides decreased in the 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg pioglitazone dose groups compared to a mean increase in the placebo group. Mean HDL cholesterol increased to a greater extent in patients treated with pioglitazone than in the placebo-treated patients. There were no consistent differences for LDL and total cholesterol in patients treated with pioglitazone compared to placebo <span class="Italics">(see Table 14).</span></p><p class="First"> <br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone </span><br/>

At steady-state, M-III and M-IV reach serum concentrations equal to or greater than that of pioglitazone. At steady-state, in both healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes, pioglitazone comprises approximately 30% to 50% of the peak total pioglitazone serum concentrations (pioglitazone plus active metabolites) and 20% to 25% of the total AUC.<br/>
<br/>
C<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC, and trough serum concentrations (C<span class="Sub">min</span>) for pioglitazone and M-III and M-IV, increased proportionally with administered doses of 15 mg and 30 mg per day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Absorption</span><br/>
<br/>
Following oral administration of pioglitazone, T<span class="Sub">max</span> of pioglitazone was within two hours. Food delays the T<span class="Sub">max</span> to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Distribution</span><br/>
<br/>
The mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of pioglitazone following single- dose administration is 0.63 ± 0.41 (mean ± SD) L/kg of body weight. Pioglitazone is extensively protein bound (&gt; 99%) in human serum, principally to serum albumin. Pioglitazone also binds to other serum proteins, but with lower affinity. M-III and M-IV are also extensively bound (&gt; 98%) to serum albumin.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Metabolism</span><br/>
<br/>
Pioglitazone is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation and oxidation; the metabolites also partly convert to glucuronide or sulfate conjugates. Metabolites M-III and M-IV are the major circulating active metabolites in humans.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">In vitro</span> data demonstrate that multiple CYP isoforms are involved in the metabolism of pioglitazone, which include CYP2C8 and, to a lesser degree, CYP3A4 with additional contributions from a variety of other isoforms including the mainly extrahepatic CYP1A1. <span class="Italics">In vivo</span> study of pioglitazone in combination with gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, showed that pioglitazone is a CYP2C8 substrate <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Urinary 6ß-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratios measured in patients treated with pioglitazone showed that pioglitazone is not a strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Excretion and Elimination</span><br/>
<br/>
Following oral administration, approximately 15% to 30% of the pioglitazone dose is recovered in the urine. Renal elimination of pioglitazone is negligible, and the drug is excreted primarily as metabolites and their conjugates. It is presumed that most of the oral dose is excreted into the bile either unchanged or as metabolites and eliminated in the feces.<br/>
<br/>
The mean serum half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of pioglitazone and its metabolites (M-III and M-IV) range from three to seven hours and 16 to 24 hours, respectively. Pioglitazone has an apparent clearance, CL/F, calculated to be five to seven L/hr.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span><br/>
<br/>
 The serum elimination half-life of pioglitazone, M-III, and M-IV remains unchanged in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 30 to 50 mL/min) and severe (CLcr&lt; 30 mL/min) renal impairment when compared to subjects with normal renal function. Therefore, no dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is required.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Hepatic Impairment</span><br/>
<br/>
Compared with healthy controls, subjects with impaired hepatic function (Child-Turcotte-Pugh Grade B/C) have an approximate 45% reduction in pioglitazone and total pioglitazone (pioglitazone, M-III, and M-IV) mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> but no change in the mean AUC values. Therefore, no dose adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment is required.<br/>
<br/>
There are postmarketing reports of liver failure with pioglitazone and clinical trials have generally excluded patients with serum ALT &gt;2.5 times the upper limit of the reference range. Use caution in patients with liver disease <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Geriatric Patients</span><br/>
<br/>
In healthy elderly subjects, C<span class="Sub">max</span> of pioglitazone was not significantly different, but AUC values were approximately 21% higher than those achieved in younger subjects. The mean t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> of pioglitazone was also prolonged in elderly subjects (about ten hours) as compared to younger subjects (about seven hours). These changes were not of a magnitude that would be considered clinically relevant.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span><br/>
<br/>
Safety and efficacy of pioglitazone in pediatric patients have not been established. Pioglitazone is not recommended for use in pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Gender</span><br/>
<br/>
The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values of pioglitazone were increased 20% to 60% in women compared to men. In controlled clinical trials, HbA1c decreases from baseline were generally greater for females than for males (average mean difference in HbA1c 0.5%). Because therapy should be individualized for each patient to achieve glycemic control, no dose adjustment is recommended based on gender alone.<br/>

Drug-induced tumors were not observed in any organ except for the urinary bladder of male rats. Benign and/or malignant transitional cell neoplasms were observed in male rats at 4 mg/kg/day and above (approximately equal to the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). Urinary calculi with subsequent irritation and hyperplasia were postulated as the mechanism for bladder tumors observed in male rats. A two-year mechanistic study in male rats utilizing dietary acidification to reduce calculi formation was completed in 2009. Dietary acidification decreased but did not abolish the hyperplastic changes in the bladder. The presence of calculi exacerbated the hyperplastic response to pioglitazone but was not considered the primary cause of the hyperplastic changes.<br/>
<br/>
The relevance to humans of the bladder findings in the male rat cannot be excluded.<br/>
<br/>
A two-year carcinogenicity study was also conducted in male and female mice at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 11 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). No drug-induced tumors were observed in any organ.<br/>
<br/>
Pioglitazone hydrochloride was not mutagenic in a battery of genetic toxicology studies, including the Ames bacterial assay, a mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay (CHO/HPRT and AS52/XPRT), an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> cytogenetics assay using CHL cells, an unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus assay.<br/>
<br/>
No adverse effects upon fertility were observed in male and female rats at oral doses up to 40 mg/kg pioglitazone hydrochloride daily prior to and throughout mating and gestation (approximately nine times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Heart enlargement has been observed in mice (100 mg/kg), rats (4 mg/kg and above) and dogs (3 mg/kg) treated orally with pioglitazone hydrochloride (approximately 11, 1, and 2 times the maximum recommended human oral dose for mice, rats, and dogs, respectively, based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). In a one-year rat study, drug-related early death due to apparent heart dysfunction occurred at an oral dose of 160 mg/kg/day (approximately 35 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). Heart enlargement was seen in a 13-week study in monkeys at oral doses of 8.9 mg/kg and above (approximately four times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), but not in a 52-week study at oral doses up to 32 mg/kg (approximately 13 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Monotherapy</h3><p class="First">Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with durations from 16 to 26 weeks were conducted to evaluate the use of pioglitazone as monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. These trials examined pioglitazone at doses up to 45 mg or placebo once daily in a total of 865 patients.<br/>
<br/>
In a 26-week dose-ranging monotherapy trial, 408 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive 7.5 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg of pioglitazone, or placebo once daily. Therapy with any previous antidiabetic agent was discontinued eight weeks prior to the double-blind period. Treatment with 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg of pioglitazone produced statistically significant improvements in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at endpoint compared to placebo <span class="Italics">(see Figure 1, Table 17).</span><br/>
