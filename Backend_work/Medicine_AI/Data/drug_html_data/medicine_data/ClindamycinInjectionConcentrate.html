Its use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or other patients for whom, in the judgment of the physician, a penicillin is inappropriate. Because of the risk of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis, as described in the <span class="Bold">WARNING﻿ box, before selecting clindamycin the physician should considere the nature of the infection and the suitability of less toxic alternatives (e.g., erythromycin).</span></p><p>Bacteriologic studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to clindamycin.</p><p>Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.</p><p>Clindamycin Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the conditions listed below:</p><p>Lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess caused by anaerobes, <span><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae, ﻿other streptococci (except <span><span class="Italics">E. faecalis﻿), and <span><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Skin and skin structure infections caused by <span><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, ﻿and anaerobes.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Gynecological infections including endometritis, nongonococcal tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic cellulitis, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection caused by susceptible anaerobes.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Intra-abdominal infections including acute hematogenous osteomyelitis caused by <span><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus﻿ and as adjunctive therapy in the surgical treatment of chronic bone and joint infections due to susceptible organisms.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>Septicemia caused by <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus, ﻿streptococci (except <span class="Italics">Enterococcus faecalis﻿), and susceptible anaerobes.</span></span></p><p>Bone and joint infections including acute hematogenous osteomyelitis caused by <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus﻿ and as adjunctive therapy in the surgical treatment of chronic bone and joint infections due to susceptible organisms.</span></p><p>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of clindamycin and other antibacterial drugs, clindamycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This drug is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to preparations containing clindamycin or lincomycin.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">See <span class="Bold">WARNING ﻿box.</span></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><span>Clostridium difficile</span></span></span> <span class="Bold"><span><span>associated diarrhea</span></span></span></p><p><span class="Italics"><span><span><span>Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea</span></span> <span><span>(CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span><span class="Italics">C. difficile.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile ﻿produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile cause increased morbidity and morality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</span></span></p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile﻿ may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile, ﻿and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span><span><span>Severe Skin Reactions</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Severe skin reactions such as toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, some with fatal outcome, have been reported.

The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events, including the "Gasping Syndrome", and death in pediatric patients. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product ordinarily deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the "gasping syndrome", the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. The risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity depends on the quantity administered and the hepatic capacity to detoxify the chemical. Premature and low birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span>Usage in Meningitis</span></span></p><p><span><span>Since clindamycin does not diffuse adequately into the cerebrospinal fluid, the drug should not be used in the treatment of meningitis.</span></span></p><p><span><span>SERIOUS ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE. OXYGEN AND INTRAVENOUS CORTICOSTEROIDS SHOULD ALSO BE ADMINISTERED AS INDICATED.</span></span></p><h2>PRECAUTIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p><p>Review of experience to date suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate diarrhea less well. When clindamycin is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for change in bowel frequency.</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals.</p><p>Certain infections may require incision and drainage or other indicated surgical procedures in addition to antibiotic therapy.</p><p>The use of clindamycin phosphate may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms - particularly yeasts. Should superinfections occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation.</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate should not be injected intravenously undiluted as a bolus, but should be infused over at least 10 to 60 minutes as directed in the <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.</span></p><p>Clindamycin dosage modification may not be necessary in patients with renal disease. In patients with moderate to severe liver disease, prolongation of clindamycin half-life has been found. However, it was postulated from studies that when given every eight hours, accumulation should rarely occur. Therefore, dosage modification in patients with liver disease may not be necessary. However, periodic liver enzyme determinations should be made when treating patients with severe liver disease.</p><p>Prescribing clindamycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><p><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span></p><p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including clindamycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When clindamycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by clindamycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span></p><p>During prolonged therapy periodic liver and kidney function tests and blood counts should be performed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.</p><p>Antagonism has been demonstrated between clindamycin and erythromycin <span class="Italics">in vitro. Because of possible clinical significance, the two drugs should not be administered concurrently.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p><span>Long term studies in animals have not been performed with clindamycin to evaluate carcinogenic potential.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p>Reproduction studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg/kg/day (2.1 and 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2﻿, respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 250 mg/kg/day (0.9 and 0.5 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2, respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity.</span></span></p><p>Clindamycin contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol can cross the placenta (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS).</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span></p><p><span>Clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk in the range of 0.7 to 3.8 mcg/mL at dosages of 150 mg orally to 600 mg intravenously.
