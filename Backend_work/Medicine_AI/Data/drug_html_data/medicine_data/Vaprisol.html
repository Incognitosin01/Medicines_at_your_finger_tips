High levels of this hormone can cause an imbalance that results in low sodium levels and fluid retention.</p><p>Vaprisol is used to treat hyponatremia (low sodium levels).</p><p>Vaprisol improves urine flow without causing the body to lose too much sodium as you urinate.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive Vaprisol if you are allergic to corn products, or if you are unable to urinate.</p><p>Serious drug interactions can occur when certain medicines are used together.
