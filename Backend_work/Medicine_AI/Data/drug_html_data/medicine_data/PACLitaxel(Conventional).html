To monitor the occurrence of bone marrow suppression, primarily neutropenia, which may be severe and result in infection, perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>â¢ Bone marrow suppression: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia; may be severe or result in infection) may occur. Monitor blood counts frequently. Do not administer if baseline neutrophil count is &lt;1,500/mm<sup>3</sup> (for solid tumors) or &lt;1,000/mm<sup>3</sup> (for patients with AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma).</b> Bone marrow suppression (usually neutropenia) is dose-dependent and is the dose-limiting toxicity; neutrophil nadir is usually at a median of 11 days. Subsequent cycles should not be administered until neutrophils are &gt;1,500/mm<sup>3</sup> (for solid tumors) and 1,000/mm<sup>3</sup> (for Kaposi sarcoma); platelets should recover to 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>. Reduce future doses by 20% for severe neutropenia (&lt;500/mm<sup>3</sup> for 7 days or more) and consider the use of supportive therapy, including growth factor treatment.</p><p>â¢ Cardiovascular effects: Infusion-related hypotension, bradycardia, and/or hypertension may occur; frequent monitoring of vital signs is recommended, especially during the first hour of the infusion. Rare but severe conduction abnormalities have been reported; conduct continuous cardiac monitoring during subsequent infusions for these patients. In a scientific statement from the American Heart Association, conventional paclitaxel has been determined to be an agent that may either cause direct myocardial toxicity or exacerbate underlying myocardial dysfunction (magnitude: moderate) (AHA [Page 2016])</p><p>â¢ Extravasation: Paclitaxel is an irritant with vesicant-like properties; ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during infusion; avoid extravasation. Injection-site reactions are generally mild (skin discoloration, tenderness, erythema, or swelling) and occur more commonly with an extended infusion duration (eg, 24 hours); injection-site reactions may be delayed (7 to 10 days). More severe reactions (phlebitis, cellulitis, skin exfoliation, necrosis, fibrosis, and induration) have also been reported. Recall skin reactions may occur despite administering through a different IV site.</p><p>â¢ Hypersensitivity reactions: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions (dyspnea requiring bronchodilators, hypotension requiring treatment, angioedema, and/or generalized urticaria) have occurred in 2% to 4% of patients in clinical studies. Premedicate with corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, and H<sub>2</sub> antagonists prior to infusion. Some reactions have been fatal despite premedication. If severe hypersensitivity occurs, stop infusion and do not rechallenge. </b>Minor hypersensitivity reactions (flushing, skin reactions, dyspnea, hypotension, or tachycardia) do not require interruption of treatment.</p><p>â¢ Peripheral neuropathy: Peripheral neuropathy may commonly occur; patients with preexisting neuropathies from prior chemotherapy or coexisting conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus) may be at a higher risk; reduce dose by 20% for severe neuropathy.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>â¢ Hepatic impairment: Use with extreme caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction (myelotoxicity may be worsened in patients with total bilirubin &gt;2 times ULN); dose reductions are recommended.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>â¢ Elderly: Use with caution in the elderly; increased risk of toxicity (severe neutropenia, neuropathy, and cardiovascular events).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>â¢ Excipients: Conventional paclitaxel formulations contain polyoxyl 35/polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor EL), which is associated with hypersensitivity reactions.
