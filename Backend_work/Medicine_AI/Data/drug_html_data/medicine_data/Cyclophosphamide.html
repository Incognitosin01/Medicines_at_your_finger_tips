</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Cyclophosphamide</h2><h3>Malignant Diseases</h3><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide Tablets is indicated for the treatment of:</p><p>Cyclophosphamide, although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs.</p><h3>Minimal Change Nephrotic Syndrome in Pediatric Patients:</h3><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide Tablets is indicated for the treatment of biopsy proven minimal change nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients who failed to adequately respond to or are unable to tolerate adrenocorticosteroid therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use:</span></p><p>The safety and effectiveness of Cyclophosphamide Tablets for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome in adults or other renal disease has not been established.</p><h2>Cyclophosphamide Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Hydration and Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">During or immediately after the administration of Cyclophosphamide Tablets, adequate amounts of fluid should be ingested or infused to force diuresis in order to reduce the risk of urinary tract toxicity. Therefore,</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Cyclophosphamide Tablets should be taken in the morning.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Cyclophosphamide Tablets should be swallowed whole. The tablets should not be chewed or crushed.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Cyclophosphamide Tablets is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures.<span class="Sup">1</span> Exposure to broken tablets should be avoided. If contact with broken tablets occurs, wash hands immediately and thoroughly.</span></p><h3>Recommended Dosage for Malignant Diseases</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adults and Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>The recommended dose of Cyclophosphamide Tablets is in the range of 1 mg per kg to 5 mg per kg orally once daily for both initial and maintenance dosing.</p><p>Other regimens of oral Cyclophosphamide have been reported. Dosages should be adjusted based on evidence of antitumor activity, myelosuppression, or other severe adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5)].</span></p><p>When Cyclophosphamide is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose of Cyclophosphamide, as well as that of the other drugs.</p><h3>Recommended Dosage for Minimal Change Nephrotic Syndrome in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of Cyclophosphamide Tablets is 2 mg per kg once daily for 8 to 12 weeks (maximum cumulative dose 168 mg per kg). Treatment beyond 90 days increases the probability of sterility in males <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Tablets:</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide Tablets are contraindicated in patients with:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myelosuppression, Immunosuppression, Bone Marrow Failure and Infections</h3><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide can cause myelosuppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia), bone marrow failure, and severe immunosuppression which may lead to serious and sometimes fatal infections, including sepsis and septic shock. Latent infections can be reactivated <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><p>Antimicrobial prophylaxis may be indicated in certain cases of neutropenia at the discretion of the managing physician. In case of neutropenic fever, antibiotic therapy is indicated. Antimycotics and/or antivirals may also be indicated.</p><p>Monitoring of complete blood counts is essential during Cyclophosphamide treatment so that the dose can be adjusted, if needed. Cyclophosphamide should not be administered to patients with neutrophils ≤1,500/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> and platelets &lt; 50,000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop a serious infection. G-CSF may be administered to reduce the risks of neutropenia complications associated with Cyclophosphamide use. Primary and secondary prophylaxis with G-CSF should be considered in all patients considered to be at increased risk for neutropenia complications. The nadirs of the reduction in leukocyte count and thrombocyte count are usually reached in weeks 1 and 2 of treatment. Peripheral blood cell counts are expected to normalize after approximately 20 days. Bone marrow failure has been reported. Severe myelosuppression may be expected particularly in patients pretreated with and/or receiving concomitant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.</p><h3>Urinary Tract and Renal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Hemorrhagic cystitis, pyelitis, ureteritis, and hematuria have been reported with Cyclophosphamide. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Discontinue Cyclophosphamide therapy in case of severe hemorrhagic cystitis.</p><p>Urotoxicity (bladder ulceration, necrosis, fibrosis, contracture and secondary cancer) may require interruption of Cyclophosphamide treatment or cystectomy. Urotoxicity can be fatal. Urotoxicity can occur with short-term or long-term use of Cyclophosphamide.</p><p>Before starting treatment, exclude or correct any urinary tract obstructions <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span> Urinary sediment should be checked regularly for the presence of erythrocytes and other signs of urotoxicity and/or nephrotoxicity. Cyclophosphamide should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active urinary tract infections. Aggressive hydration with forced diuresis and frequent bladder emptying can reduce the frequency and severity of bladder toxicity. Mesna has been used to prevent severe bladder toxicity.</p><h3>Cardiotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Myocarditis, myopericarditis, pericardial effusion including cardiac tamponade, and congestive heart failure, which may be fatal, have been reported with Cyclophosphamide therapy</p><p>Supraventricular arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation and flutter) and ventricular arrhythmias (including severe QT prolongation associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmia) have been reported after treatment with regimens that included Cyclophosphamide.</p><p>The risk of cardiotoxicity may be increased with high doses of Cyclophosphamide, in patients with advanced age, and in patients with previous radiation treatment to the cardiac region and/or previous or concomitant treatment with other cardiotoxic agents.</p><p>Particular caution is necessary in patients with risk factors for cardiotoxicity and in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease.</p><p>Monitor patients with risk factors for cardiotoxicity and with pre-existing cardiac disease.</p><h3>Pulmonary Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and other forms of pulmonary toxicity leading to respiratory failure have been reported during and following treatment with Cyclophosphamide. Late onset pneumonitis (greater than 6 months after start of Cyclophosphamide) appears to be associated with increased mortality. Pneumonitis may develop years after treatment with Cyclophosphamide.</p><p>Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity.</p><h3>Secondary Malignancies</h3><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide is genotoxic <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>. Secondary malignancies (urinary tract cancer, myelodysplasia, acute leukemias, lymphomas, thyroid cancer, and sarcomas) have been reported in patients treated with Cyclophosphamide-containing regimens. The risk of bladder cancer may be reduced by prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis.</p><h3>Veno-occlusive Liver Disease</h3><p class="First">Veno-occlusive liver disease (VOD) including fatal outcome has been reported in patients receiving Cyclophosphamide-containing regimens. A cytoreductive regimen in preparation for bone marrow transplantation that consists of Cyclophosphamide in combination with whole-body irradiation, busulfan, or other agents has been identified as a major risk factor. VOD has also been reported to develop gradually in patients receiving long-term low-dose immunosuppressive doses of Cyclophosphamide. Other risk factors predisposing to the development of VOD include preexisting disturbances of hepatic function, previous radiation therapy of the abdomen, and a low performance status.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Based on its mechanism of action and published reports of effects in pregnant patients or animals, Cyclophosphamide Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see</span></span> <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span><span class="following_xmChange">,</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)</span><span class="following_xmChange">, and</span> <span class="Italics">Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)<span class="following_xmChange">].</span></span> <span class="following_xmChange">Exposure to Cyclophosphamide during pregnancy may cause birth defects, miscarriage, fetal growth retardation, and fetotoxic effects in the newborn. Cyclophosphamide is teratogenic and embryo-fetal toxic in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see</span></span> <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.1)<span class="following_xmChange">].</span></span> <span class="following_xmChange">Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of Cyclophosphamide Tablets. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Cyclophosphamide Tablets and for up to 1 year after completion of therapy. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Cyclophosphamide Tablets and for 4 months after completion of therapy <span class="Italics">[see</span></span> <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.1<span class="following_xmChange">,</span> 8.3)<span class="following_xmChange">].</span></span></p><h3>Infertility</h3><p class="First">Male and female reproductive function and fertility may be impaired in patients being treated with Cyclophosphamide Tablets. Cyclophosphamide interferes with oogenesis and spermatogenesis. It may cause sterility in both sexes. Development of sterility appears to depend on the dose of Cyclophosphamide, duration of therapy, and the state of gonadal function at the time of treatment. Cyclophosphamide-induced sterility may be irreversible in some patients. Advise patients on the potential risks for infertility <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.3, 8.4)].</span></p><h3>Impairment of Wound Healing</h3><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide may interfere with normal wound healing.</p><h3>Hyponatremia</h3><p class="First">Hyponatremia associated with increased total body water, acute water intoxication, and a syndrome resembling SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone), which may be fatal, has been reported.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling.</p><h3>Common Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Hematopoietic system:<br/></span> Neutropenia occurs in patients treated with Cyclophosphamide. The degree of neutropenia is particularly important because it correlates with a reduction in resistance to infections. Fever without documented infection has been reported in neutropenic patients.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal system:<br/></span> Nausea and vomiting occur with Cyclophosphamide therapy. Anorexia and, less frequently, abdominal discomfort or pain and diarrhea may occur. There are isolated reports of hemorrhagic colitis, oral mucosal ulceration and jaundice occurring during therapy.</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and its structures:<br/></span> Alopecia occurs in patients treated with Cyclophosphamide. Skin rash occurs occasionally in patients receiving the drug. Pigmentation of the skin and changes in nails can occur.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance.

This interaction may result in an increased incidence of graft-versus-host disease.</p><p>Depolarizing muscle relaxants: Cyclophosphamide treatment causes a marked and persistent inhibition of cholinesterase activity. Prolonged apnea may occur with concurrent depolarizing muscle relaxants (e.g., succinylcholine). If a patient has been treated with Cyclophosphamide within 10 days of general anesthesia, alert the anesthesiologist.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary<br/></span> Based on its mechanism of action and published reports of effects in pregnant patients or animals, Cyclophosphamide Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)</span> and <span class="Italics">Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span> Exposure to Cyclophosphamide during pregnancy may cause fetal malformations, miscarriage, fetal growth retardation, and toxic effects in the newborn [see Data]. Cyclophosphamide is teratogenic and embryo-fetal toxic in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2%-4% and of miscarriage is 15%-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data<br/></span> <span class="Italics">Human Data<br/></span> Malformations of the skeleton, palate, limbs and eyes as well as miscarriage have been reported after exposure to Cyclophosphamide in the first trimester. Fetal growth retardation and toxic effects manifesting in the newborn, including leukopenia, anemia, pancytopenia, severe bone marrow hypoplasia, and gastroenteritis have been reported after exposure to Cyclophosphamide.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span><br/>
Administration of Cyclophosphamide to pregnant mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses at or below the dose in patients based on body surface area resulted in various malformations, which included neural tube defects, limb and digit defects and other skeletal anomalies, cleft lip and palate, and reduced skeletal ossification.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary<br/></span> Cyclophosphamide is present in breast milk. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, low hemoglobin, and diarrhea have been reported in infants breastfed by women treated with Cyclophosphamide. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from Cyclophosphamide, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Testing<br/></span> Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Cyclophosphamide Tablets <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Contraception<br/></span> <span class="Italics">Females<br/></span> Cyclophosphamide can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Cyclophosphamide Tablets and for up to 1 year after completion of therapy <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Males</span><br/>
Based on findings in genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Cyclophosphamide Tablets and for at least 4 months after completion of therapy <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Infertility<br/></span> <span class="Italics">Females<br/></span> Amenorrhea, transient or permanent, associated with decreased estrogen and increased gonadotropin secretion develops in a proportion of women treated with Cyclophosphamide. Affected patients generally resume regular menses within a few months after cessation of therapy. The risk of premature menopause with Cyclophosphamide increases with age. Oligomenorrhea has also been reported in association with Cyclophosphamide treatment.</p><p>Animal data suggest an increased risk of failed pregnancy and malformations may persist after discontinuation of Cyclophosphamide as long as oocytes/follicles exist that were exposed to Cyclophosphamide during any of their maturation phases. The exact duration of follicular development in humans is not known, but may be longer than 12 months <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Males<br/></span> Men treated with Cyclophosphamide may develop oligospermia or azoospermia which are normally associated with increased gonadotropin but normal testosterone secretion.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Pre-pubescent girls treated with Cyclophosphamide generally develop secondary sexual characteristics normally and have regular menses. Ovarian fibrosis with apparently complete loss of germ cells after prolonged Cyclophosphamide treatment in late pre-pubescence has been reported. Girls treated with Cyclophosphamide who have retained ovarian function after completing treatment are at increased risk of developing premature menopause.</p><p>Pre-pubescent boys treated with Cyclophosphamide develop secondary sexual characteristics normally, but may have oligospermia or azoospermia and increased gonadotropin secretion. Some degree of testicular atrophy may occur. Cyclophosphamide-induced azoospermia is reversible in some patients, though the reversibility may not occur for several years after cessation of therapy.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">There is insufficient data from clinical studies of Cyclophosphamide available for patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac functioning, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Use in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with severe renal impairment, decreased renal excretion may result in increased plasma levels of Cyclophosphamide and its metabolites. This may result in increased toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> Monitor patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl =10 mL/min to 24 mL/min) for signs and symptoms of toxicity.</p><p>Cyclophosphamide and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dialysis system being used. In patients requiring dialysis, use of a consistent interval between Cyclophosphamide administration and dialysis should be considered.</p><h3>Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with severe hepatic impairment have reduced conversion of Cyclophosphamide to the active 4-hydroxyl metabolite, potentially reducing efficacy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">No specific antidote for Cyclophosphamide is known.</p><p>Overdosage should be managed with supportive measures, including appropriate treatment for any concurrent infection, myelosuppression, or cardiac toxicity should it occur.</p><p>Serious consequences of overdosage include manifestations of dose dependent toxicities such as myelosuppression, urotoxicity, cardiotoxicity (including cardiac failure), veno-occlusive hepatic disease, and stomatitis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.6)].</span></p><p>Patients who received an overdose should be closely monitored for the development of toxicities, and hematologic toxicity in particular.</p><p>Cyclophosphamide and its metabolites are dialyzable. Therefore, rapid hemodialysis is indicated when treating any suicidal or accidental overdose or intoxication.</p><p>Cystitis prophylaxis with mesna may be helpful in preventing or limiting urotoxic effects with Cyclophosphamide overdose.</p><h2>Cyclophosphamide Description</h2><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide is a synthetic antineoplastic drug chemically related to the nitrogen mustards. The chemical name for Cyclophosphamide is 2-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]tetrahydro-2H-1,3,2-oxazaphosphorine 2-oxide monohydrate, and has the following structural formula:</p><p>Cyclophosphamide has a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">7</span>H<span class="Sub">15</span>Cl<span class="Sub">2</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>P•H<span class="Sub">2</span>O and a molecular weight of 279.1. Cyclophosphamide is soluble in water, saline, or ethanol.</p><p>Cyclophosphamide Tablets, USP are for oral use and contain 25 mg or 50 mg Cyclophosphamide (anhydrous). Inactive ingredients in Cyclophosphamide Tablets are: acacia, FD&amp;C Blue No. 1, D&amp;C Yellow No. 10 Aluminum Lake, lactose, magnesium stearate, starch, stearic acid and talc.</p><h2>Cyclophosphamide - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action is thought to involve cross-linking of tumor cell DNA.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide is biotransformed principally in the liver to active alkylating metabolites by a mixed function microsomal oxidase system. These metabolites interfere with the growth of susceptible rapidly proliferating malignant cells.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span><br/>
After oral administration, peak concentrations of Cyclophosphamide occurred at one hour. Area under the curve ratio for the drug after oral and IV administration (AUC<span class="Sub">po</span> : AUC<span class="Sub">iv</span>) ranged from 0.87 to 0.96.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span><br/>
Approximately 20% of Cyclophosphamide is protein bound, with no dose dependent changes. Some metabolites are protein bound to an extent greater than 60%. Volume of distribution approximates total body water (30 to 50 L).</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span><br/>
The liver is the major site of Cyclophosphamide activation. Approximately 75% of the administered dose of Cyclophosphamide is activated by hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450s including CYP2A6, 2B6, 3A4, 3A5, 2C9, 2C18 and 2C19, with 2B6 displaying the highest 4-hydroxylase activity. Cyclophosphamide is activated to form 4-hydroxyCyclophosphamide, which is in equilibrium with its ring-open tautomer aldophosphamide. 4-hydroxyCyclophosphamide and aldophosphamide can undergo oxidation by aldehyde dehydrogenases to form the inactive metabolites 4-ketoCyclophosphamide and carboxyphosphamide, respectively. Aldophosphamide can undergo β-elimination to form active metabolites phosphoramide mustard and acrolein. This spontaneous conversion can be catalyzed by albumin and other proteins. Less than 5% of Cyclophosphamide may be directly detoxified by side chain oxidation, leading to the formation of inactive metabolites 2-dechloroethylCyclophosphamide. At high doses, the fraction of parent compound cleared by 4-hydroxylation is reduced resulting in non-linear elimination of Cyclophosphamide in patients. Cyclophosphamide appears to induce its own metabolism. Auto-induction results in an increase in the total clearance, increased formation of 4-hydroxyl metabolites and shortened t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> values following repeated administration at 12- to 24-hour interval.</p><p><span class="Italics">Elimination</span><br/>
Cyclophosphamide is primarily excreted as metabolites. 10 to 20% is excreted unchanged in the urine and 4% is excreted in the bile following IV administration.</p><p><span class="Italics">Special Populations</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment<br/></span> The pharmacokinetics of Cyclophosphamide were determined following one-hour intravenous infusion to renally impaired patients. The results demonstrated that the systemic exposure to Cyclophosphamide increased as the renal function decreased. Mean dose-corrected AUC increased by 38% in the moderate renal group, (Creatinine clearance (CrCl of 25 to 50 mL/min), by 64% in the severe renal group (CrCl of 10 to 24 mL/min) and by 23% in the hemodialysis group (CrCl of &lt; 10 mL/min) compared to the control group. The increase in exposure was significant in the severe group (p&gt;0.05); thus, patients with severe renal impairment should be closely monitored for toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</span></p><p>The dialyzability of Cyclophosphamide was investigated in four patients on long-term hemodialysis. Dialysis clearance calculated by arterial-venous difference and actual drug recovery in dialysate averaged 104 mL/min, which is in the range of the metabolic clearance of 95 mL/min for the drug. A mean of 37% of the administered dose of Cyclophosphamide was removed during hemodialysis. The elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) was 3.3 hours in patients during hemodialysis, a 49% reduction of the 6.5 hours to t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> reported in uremic patients. Reduction in t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>, larger dialysis clearance than metabolic clearance, high extraction efficiency, and significant drug removal during dialysis, suggest that Cyclophosphamide is dialyzable.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatic Impairment</span><br/>
Total body clearance (CL) of Cyclophosphamide is decreased by 40% in patients with severe hepatic impairment and elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) is prolonged by 64%. Mean CL and t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> were 45 ± 8.6 L/kg and 12.5 ± 1.0 hours respectively, in patients with severe hepatic impairment and 63 ± 7.6 L/kg and 7.6 ± 1.4 hours respectively in the control group <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].</span></p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide administered by different routes, including intravenous, subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection, or in drinking water, caused tumors in both mice and rats. In addition to leukemia and lymphoma, benign and malignant tumors were found at various tissue sites, including urinary bladder, mammary gland, lung, liver, and injection site <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].</span></p><p>Cyclophosphamide was mutagenic and clastogenic in multiple in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicology studies.</p><p>Cyclophosphamide is genotoxic in male and female germ cells. Animal data indicate that exposure of oocytes to Cyclophosphamide during follicular development may result in a decreased rate of implantations and viable pregnancies, and in an increased risk of malformations. Male mice and rats treated with Cyclophosphamide show alterations in male reproductive organs (e.g., decreased weights, atrophy, changes in spermatogenesis), and decreases in reproductive potential (e.g., decreased implantations and increased post-implantation loss) and increases in fetal malformations when mated with untreated females <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].</span></p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">1.
