Estradiol is a form of estrogen, a female sex hormone that regulates many processes in the body. Each spray delivers 90 mcL which contains 1.53 mg of estradiol.</p><p>Evamist is used to reduce moderate to severe hot flashes due to menopause.</p><p>Evamist may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Evamist if you have any of the following conditions: a history of heart attack, stroke, or blood clot, a bleeding or blood-clotting disorder, liver disease, abnormal vaginal bleeding, history of an allergic reaction to estradiol topical, or a hormone-related cancer such as breast or uterine cancer.</p><p><b>Do not use Evamist if you are pregnant.</b></p><p>Estradiol may increase your risk of developing a condition that may lead to uterine cancer. Call your doctor at once if you have any unusual vaginal bleeding while using this medicine.</p><p>Children should avoid coming into contact with skin areas where you have applied Evamist. <b>Topical estradiol is absorbed through the skin and can cause side effects in a child who comes into contact with this medicine or with skin where Evamist was applied.</b></p><p>Estradiol should not be used to prevent heart disease, stroke, or dementia, because this medicine may actually increase your risk of developing these conditions.
