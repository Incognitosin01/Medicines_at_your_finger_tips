</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tetrabenazine can increase the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts and</span> <span class="Bold">behavior (suicidality) in patients with Huntington’s disease. Anyone considering the use of tetrabenazine must balance the risks of depression and suicidality with the clinical need for control of chorea. Close observation of patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior should accompany therapy. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the risk of depression and suicidality and should be instructed to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician.</span> <span class="Bold">Particular caution should be exercised in treating patients with a history of depression or prior suicide attempts or ideation, which are increased in frequency in Huntington’s disease. Tetrabenazine is contraindicated in patients who are actively suicidal, and in patients with untreated or inadequately treated depression</span> <span class="Bold">[see Contraindications (</span><span class="Bold Italics">4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Tetrabenazine Tablets</h2><p class="First">Tetrabenazine Tablets are indicated for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease.</p><h2>Tetrabenazine Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Dosing Considerations</h3><p class="First">The chronic daily dose of Tetrabenazine Tablets used to treat chorea associated with Huntington's disease (HD) is determined individually for each patient. When first prescribed, tetrabenazine therapy should be titrated slowly over several weeks to identify a dose of Tetrabenazine Tablets that reduces chorea and is tolerated. Tetrabenazine Tablets can be administered without regard to food <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span><span class="None">.</span></p><h3>Individualization of Dose</h3><p class="First">The dose of Tetrabenazine Tablets should be individualized.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Dosing Recommendations Up to 50 mg per day  </span></p><p>The starting dose should be 12.5 mg per day given once in the morning. After one week, the dose should be increased to 25 mg per day given as 12.5 mg twice a day. Tetrabenazine Tablets should be titrated up slowly at weekly intervals by 12.5 mg daily, to allow the identification of a tolerated dose that reduces chorea. If a dose of 37.5 mg to 50 mg per day is needed, it should be given in a three times a day regimen. The maximum recommended single dose is 25 mg. If adverse reactions such as akathisia, restlessness, parkinsonism, depression, insomnia, anxiety or sedation occur, titration should be stopped and the dose should be reduced. If the adverse reaction does not resolve, consideration should be given to withdrawing tetrabenazine treatment or initiating other specific treatment (e.g., antidepressants) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Dosing Recommendations Above 50 mg per day</span> </p><p>Patients who require doses of Tetrabenazine Tablets greater than 50 mg per day should be first tested and genotyped to determine if they are poor metabolizers (PMs) or extensive metabolizers (EMs) by their ability to express the drug metabolizing enzyme, CYP2D6. The dose of tetrabenazine should then be individualized accordingly to their status as PMs or EMs <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.  </p><p><span class="Italics">Extensive and Intermediate CYP2D6 Metabolizers  </span></p><p>Genotyped patients who are identified as extensive (EMs) or intermediate metabolizers (IMs) of CYP2D6, who need doses of Tetrabenazine Tablets above 50 mg per day, should be titrated up slowly at weekly intervals by 12.5 mg daily, to allow the identification of a tolerated dose that reduces chorea. Doses above 50 mg per day should be given in a three times a day regimen. The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg and the maximum recommended single dose is 37.5 mg. If adverse reactions such as akathisia, parkinsonism, depression, insomnia, anxiety or sedation occur, titration should be stopped and the dose should be reduced. If the adverse reaction does not resolve, consideration should be given to withdrawing tetrabenazine treatment or initiating other specific treatment (e.g., antidepressants) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.  </p><p><span class="Italics">Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers</span> </p><p>In PMs, the initial dose and titration is similar to EMs except that the recommended maximum single dose is 25 mg, and the recommended daily dose should not exceed a maximum of 50 mg <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustment with CYP2D6 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors  </span></p><p>Medications that are strong CYP2D6 inhibitors such as quinidine or antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine) significantly increase the exposure to α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ; therefore, the total dose of Tetrabenazine Tablets should not exceed a maximum of 50 mg and the maximum single dose should not exceed 25 mg <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Discontinuation of Treatment</h3><p class="First">Treatment with tetrabenazine can be discontinued without tapering. Re-emergence of chorea may occur within 12 to 18 hours after the last dose of tetrabenazine <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Resumption of Treatment</h3><p class="First">Following treatment interruption of greater than five (5) days, tetrabenazine therapy should be re-titrated when resumed. For short-term treatment interruption of less than five (5) days, treatment can be resumed at the previous maintenance dose without titration.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Tetrabenazine Tablets are available in the following strengths:</p><p>Tetrabenazine Tablets 12.5 mg are available for oral administration as white to off-white, round, flat face, bevelled edge, unscored tablets, engraved “T12.5” on one side, “APO” on the other side.</p><p>Tetrabenazine Tablets 25 mg are available for oral administration as yellow, round, flat face, bevelled edge tablets with functional scoring on one side, engraved “APO” over “T25” on the other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Tetrabenazine Tablets are contraindicated in patients:</p><ul>

Tetrabenazine increases the risk for suicidality in patients with HD.  </p><p>In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with Huntington’s disease, 10 of 54 patients (19%) treated with tetrabenazine were reported to have an adverse event of depression or worsening depression compared to none of the 30 placebo-treated patients. In two open-label studies (in one study, 29 patients received tetrabenazine for up to 48 weeks; in the second study, 75 patients received tetrabenazine for up to 80 weeks), the rate of depression/worsening depression was 35%.  </p><p>In all of the HD chorea studies of tetrabenazine (n=187), one patient committed suicide, one attempted suicide, and six had suicidal ideation.   When considering the use of tetrabenazine, the risk of suicidality should be balanced against the need for treatment of chorea. All patients treated with tetrabenazine should be observed for new or worsening depression or suicidality. If depression or suicidality does not resolve, consider discontinuing treatment with tetrabenazine.</p><p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the risks of depression, worsening depression, and suicidality associated with tetrabenazine, and should be instructed to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician. Patients with HD who express suicidal ideation should be evaluated immediately.</p><h3>Clinical Worsening and Adverse Effects</h3><p class="First">Huntington’s disease is a progressive disorder characterized by changes in mood, cognition, chorea, rigidity, and functional capacity over time. In a 12-week controlled trial, tetrabenazine was also shown to cause slight worsening in mood, cognition, rigidity, and functional capacity. Whether these effects persist, resolve, or worsen with continued treatment is unknown.  </p><p>Prescribers  should periodically re-evaluate the need for tetrabenazine in their patients by assessing the effect on chorea and possible adverse effects, including depression and suicidality, cognitive decline, parkinsonism, dysphagia, sedation/somnolence, akathisia, restlessness, and disability. It may be difficult to distinguish between adverse reactions and progression of the underlying disease; decreasing the dose or stopping the drug may help the clinician distinguish between the two possibilities. In some patients, underlying chorea itself may improve over time, decreasing the need for tetrabenazine.  </p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Before prescribing a daily dose of tetrabenazine that is greater than 50 mg per day, patients should be genotyped to determine if they express the drug metabolizing enzyme, CYP2D6. CYP2D6 testing is necessary to determine whether patients are poor metabolizers (PMs), extensive (EMs) or intermediate metabolizers (IMs) of tetrabenazine.</p><p>Patients who are PMs of tetrabenazine will have substantially higher levels of the primary drug metabolites (about 3-fold for α-HTBZ and 9-fold for β-HTBZ) than patients who are EMs. The dosage should be adjusted according to a patient's CYP2D6 metabolizer status. In patients who are identified as CYP2D6 PMs, the maximum recommended total daily dose is 50 mg and the maximum recommended single dose is 25 mg <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)</h3><p class="First">A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with tetrabenazine and other drugs that reduce dopaminergic transmission <span class="Italics">[see  Drug Interactions (7.6)]</span>. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnosis of NMS can be complicated; other serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection), and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal disorders can present with similar signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.</p><p>The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of tetrabenazine; (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.</p><p>Recurrence of NMS has been reported with resumption of drug therapy. If treatment with tetrabenazine is needed after recovery from NMS, patients should be monitored for signs of recurrence.</p><h3>Akathisia, Restlessness, and Agitation</h3><p class="First">Tetrabenazine may increase the risk of akathisia, restlessness, and agitation.</p><p>In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with HD, akathisia was observed in 10 (19%) of tetrabenazine-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients. In an 80-week open-label study, akathisia was observed in 20% of tetrabenazine-treated patients.</p><p>Patients receiving tetrabenazine should be monitored for the presence of akathisia. Patients receiving tetrabenazine should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of restlessness and agitation, as these may be indicators of developing akathisia. If a patient develops akathisia, the tetrabenazine dose should be reduced; however, some patients may require discontinuation of therapy.</p><h3>Parkinsonism</h3><p class="First">Tetrabenazine can cause parkinsonism. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with HD, symptoms suggestive of parkinsonism (i.e., bradykinesia, hypertonia and rigidity) were observed in 15% of tetrabenazine-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. In 48-week and 80-week, open-label studies, symptoms suggestive of parkinsonism were observed in 10% and 3% of tetrabenazine-treated patients, respectively.</p><p>Because rigidity can develop as part of the underlying disease process in Huntington's disease, it may be difficult to distinguish between this drug-induced adverse reaction and progression of the underlying disease process. Drug-induced parkinsonism has the potential to cause more functional disability than untreated chorea for some patients with Huntington's disease. If a patient develops parkinsonism during treatment with tetrabenazine, dose reduction should be considered; in some patients, discontinuation of therapy may be necessary.</p><h3>Sedation and Somnolence</h3><p class="First">Sedation is the most common dose-limiting adverse reaction of tetrabenazine. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with chorea associated with HD, sedation/somnolence occurred in 17/54 (31%) of tetrabenazine-treated patients and in 1 (3%) of placebo-treated patient. Sedation was the reason upward titration of tetrabenazine was stopped and/or the dose of tetrabenazine was decreased in 15/54 (28%) patients. In all but one case, decreasing the dose of tetrabenazine resulted in decreased sedation. In 48-week and 80-week, open-label studies, sedation/somnolence occurred in 17% and 57% of tetrabenazine-treated patients, respectively. In some patients, sedation occurred at doses that were lower than recommended doses.</p><p>Patients should not perform activities requiring mental alertness to maintain the safety of themselves or others, such as operating a motor vehicle or operating hazardous machinery, until they are on a maintenance dose of tetrabenazine and know how the drug affects them.</p><h3>QTc Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Tetrabenazine causes a small increase (about 8 msec) in the corrected QT (QTc) interval. QT prolongation can lead to development of torsade de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia with the risk increasing as the degree of prolongation increases <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span> The use of Tetrabenazine Tablets should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc, including antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol, thioridazine, ziprasidone), antibiotics (e.g., moxifloxacin), Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications or any other medications known to prolong the QTc interval <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.5)]</span>.</p><p>Tetrabenazine should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including (1) bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypotension and Orthostatic Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Tetrabenazine induced postural dizziness in healthy volunteers receiving single doses of 25 or 50 mg. One subject had syncope, and one subject with postural dizziness had documented orthostasis. Dizziness occurred in 4% of tetrabenazine-treated patients (vs. none on placebo) in the 12-week, controlled trial; however, blood pressure was not measured during these events. Monitoring of vital signs on standing should be considered in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension.</p><h3>Hyperprolactinemia</h3><p class="First">Tetrabenazine elevates serum prolactin concentrations in humans. Following administration of 25 mg to healthy volunteers, peak plasma prolactin levels increased 4- to 5-fold. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, a factor of potential importance if tetrabenazine is being considered for a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although amenorrhea, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence can be caused by elevated serum prolactin concentrations, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin concentrations for most patients is unknown. Chronic increase in serum prolactin levels (although not evaluated in the tetrabenazine development program) has been associated with low levels of estrogen and increased risk of osteoporosis. If there is a clinical suspicion of symptomatic hyperprolactinemia, appropriate laboratory testing should be done and consideration should be given to discontinuation of tetrabenazine.</p><h3>Binding to Melanin-Containing Tissues</h3><p class="First">Since tetrabenazine or its metabolites bind to melanin-containing tissues, it could accumulate in these tissues over time. This raises the possibility that tetrabenazine may cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. Neither ophthalmologic nor microscopic examination of the eye has been conducted in the chronic toxicity studies in a pigmented species, such as dogs. Ophthalmologic monitoring in humans was inadequate to exclude the possibility of injury occurring after long-term exposure.  </p><p>The clinical relevance of tetrabenazine’s binding to melanin-containing tissues is unknown. Although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmologic monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul>

The conditions and duration of exposure to tetrabenazine varied greatly, and included single-dose and multiple-dose clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers (n=259) and open-label (n=529) and double-blind studies (n=84) in patients.  </p><p>In a randomized, 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trial of HD patients, adverse reactions were more common in the tetrabenazine group than in the placebo group. Forty-nine of 54 (91%) patients who received tetrabenazine experienced one or more adverse reactions at any time during the study. The most common adverse reactions (over 10%, and at least 5% greater than placebo) were sedation/somnolence, fatigue, insomnia, depression, akathisia, anxiety/anxiety aggravated, and nausea.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥4% of Patients</span> </p><p>The number and percentage of the most common adverse reactions that occurred at any time during the study in ≥4% of tetrabenazine-treated patients, and with a greater frequency than in placebo-treated patients, are presented in Table 1.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1</span>: <span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in a 12-Week, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial</span> <span class="Bold">in Patients with Huntington’s Disease</span></p><p>Dose escalation was discontinued or dosage of study drug was reduced because of one or more adverse reactions in 28 of 54 (52%) patients randomized to tetrabenazine. These adverse reactions consisted of sedation (15), akathisia (7), parkinsonism (4), depression (3), anxiety (2), fatigue (1) and diarrhea (1). Some patients had more than one AR and are, therefore, counted more than once.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Due to Extrapyramidal Symptoms  </span></p><p>Table 2 describes the incidence of events considered to be extrapyramidal adverse reactions which occurred at a greater frequency in tetrabenazine-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. <span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Adverse Reactions Due to Extrapyramidal Symptoms in a 12-Week, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial</span> <span class="Bold">in Patients with Huntington’s Disease</span></p><p><span class="Sup">1</span> Patients with the following adverse event preferred terms were counted in this category: akathisia, hyperkinesia, restlessness.</p><p><span class="Sup">2</span> Patients with the following adverse event preferred terms were counted in this category: bradykinesia, parkinsonism, extrapyramidal disorder, hypertonia.  </p><p>Patients may have had events in more than one category.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Dysphagia</span></p><p>Dysphagia is a component of HD. However, drugs that reduce dopaminergic transmission have been associated with esophageal dysmotility and dysphagia. Dysphagia may be associated with aspiration pneumonia. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with HD, dysphagia was observed in 4% of tetrabenazine-treated patients and 3% of placebo-treated patients. In 48-week and 80-week, open-label studies, dysphagia was observed in 10% and 8% of tetrabenazine-treated patients, respectively. Some of the cases of dysphagia were associated with aspiration pneumonia. Whether these events were related to treatment is unknown.  </p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Tetrabenazine Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Nervous system disorders: tremor</p><p>Psychiatric disorders: confusion, worsening aggression</p><p>Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: pneumonia</p><p>Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: hyperhidrosis, skin rash</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicate that α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ are substrates for CYP2D6. Strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine) markedly increase exposure to these metabolites. A reduction in tetrabenazine dose may be necessary when adding a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine) in patients maintained on a stable dose of tetrabenazine. The daily dose of tetrabenazine should not exceed 50 mg per day and the maximum single dose of tetrabenazine should not exceed 25 mg in patients taking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Reserpine</h3><p class="First">Reserpine binds irreversibly to VMAT2, and the duration of its effect is several days. Prescribers should wait for chorea to re-emerge before administering tetrabenazine to avoid overdosage and major depletion of serotonin and norepinephrine in the CNS. At least 20 days should elapse after stopping reserpine before starting tetrabenazine. Tetrabenazine and reserpine should not be used concomitantly <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)</h3><p class="First">Tetrabenazine is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs.

Administration of tetrabenazine to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in an increase in stillbirths and postnatal offspring mortality. Administration of a major human metabolite of tetrabenazine to rats during pregnancy or during pregnancy and lactation produced adverse effects on the developing fetus and offspring (increased mortality, decreased growth, and neurobehavioral and reproductive impairment).

The molecular weight of tetrabenazine is 317.43 g/mol; the pKa is 6.51. Tetrabenazine is a hexahydro-dimethoxy-benzoquinolizine derivative and has the following chemical name: cis rac –1,3,4,6,7,11b-hexahydro-9,10-dimethoxy-3-(2-methylpropyl)-2H-benzo[a]quinolizin-2-one.</p><p>The molecular formula C<span class="Sub">19</span>H<span class="Sub">27</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span> is represented by the following molecular structure:</p><p>Tetrabenazine is a white to almost white powder that is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol.</p><p>Each tetrabenazine tablet contains either 12.5 or 25 mg of tetrabenazine as the active ingredient.</p><p>Tetrabenazine Tablets contain tetrabenazine as the active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients: anhydrous lactose, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium and magnesium stearate.

Tetrabenazine reversibly inhibits the human vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) (K<span class="Sub">i</span> ≈ 100 nM), resulting in decreased uptake of monoamines into synaptic vesicles and depletion of monoamine stores. Human VMAT2 is also inhibited by dihydrotetrabenazine (HTBZ), a mixture of α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ. α- and β-HTBZ, major circulating metabolites in humans, exhibit high <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> binding affinity to bovine VMAT2. Tetrabenazine exhibits weak <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> binding affinity at the dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor (K<span class="Sub">i</span> = 2100 nM).</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">QTc Prolongation</span> </p><p>The effect of a single 25 or 50 mg dose of tetrabenazine on the QT interval was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in healthy male and female subjects with moxifloxacin as a positive control. At 50 mg, tetrabenazine caused an approximately 8 msec mean increase in QTc (90% CI: 5.0, 10.4 msec). Additional data suggest that inhibition of CYP2D6 in healthy subjects given a single 50 mg dose of tetrabenazine does not further increase the effect on the QTc interval. Effects at higher exposures to either tetrabenazine or its metabolites have not been evaluated <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Drug Interactions (7.5)].</span> </p><p><span class="Bold">Melanin Binding  </span></p><p>Tetrabenazine or its metabolites bind to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eye, skin, fur) in pigmented rats. After a single oral dose of radiolabeled tetrabenazine, radioactivity was still detected in eye and fur at 21 days post dosing <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following oral administration of tetrabenazine, the extent of absorption is at least 75%. After single oral doses ranging from 12.5 to 50 mg, plasma concentrations of tetrabenazine are generally below the limit of detection because of the rapid and extensive hepatic metabolism of tetrabenazine by carbonyl reductase to the active metabolites α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ. α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ are metabolized principally by CYP2D6. Peak plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ are reached within 1 to 1½ hours post-dosing. α-HTBZ is subsequently metabolized to a minor metabolite, 9-desmethyl-α-DHTBZ. β-HTBZ is subsequently metabolized to another major circulating metabolite, 9-desmethyl-β-DHTBZ, for which C<span class="Sub">max</span> is reached approximately 2 hours post-dosing.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Food Effects</span></p><p>The effects of food on the bioavailability of tetrabenazine were studied in subjects administered a single dose with and without food. Food had no effect on mean plasma concentrations, C<span class="Sub">max</span>, or the area under the concentration time course (AUC) of α-HTBZ or β-HTBZ [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].  </p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Results of PET-scan studies in humans show that radioactivity is rapidly distributed to the brain following intravenous injection of <span class="Sup">11</span>C-labeled tetrabenazine or α-HTBZ, with the highest binding in the striatum and lowest binding in the cortex.  </p><p>The in vitro protein binding of tetrabenazine, α-HTBZ, and β-HTBZ was examined in human plasma for concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 ng/mL. Tetrabenazine binding ranged from 82% to 85%, α-HTBZ binding ranged from 60% to 68%, and β-HTBZ binding ranged from 59% to 63%.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism  </span></p><p>After oral administration in humans, at least 19 metabolites of tetrabenazine have been identified. α-HTBZ, β-HTBZ and 9-desmethyl-β-DHTBZ are the major circulating metabolites and are subsequently metabolized to sulfate or glucuronide conjugates. α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ are formed by carbonyl reductase that occurs mainly in the liver. α-HTBZ is O­dealkylated by CYP450 enzymes, principally CYP2D6, with some contribution of CYP1A2 to form 9-desmethyl-α-DHTBZ, a minor metabolite. β-HTBZ is O-dealkylated principally by CYP2D6 to form 9-desmethyl-β-DHTBZ.  </p><p>The results of in vitro studies do not suggest that tetrabenazine, α-HTBZ, or β-HTBZ or 9­desmethyl-β-DHTBZ are likely to result in clinically significant inhibition of CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or CYP3A. In vitro studies suggest that neither tetrabenazine nor its α- or β-HTBZ or 9-desmethyl-β-DHTBZ metabolites are likely to result in clinically significant induction of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19.  </p><p>Neither tetrabenazine nor its α- or β-HTBZ or 9-desmethyl-β-DHTBZ metabolites are likely to be a substrates or inhibitors of P-glycoprotein at clinically relevant concentrations in vivo.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>After oral administration, tetrabenazine is extensively hepatically metabolized, and the metabolites are primarily renally eliminated. α-HTBZ, β-HTBZ and 9-desmethyl-β-DHTBZ have half-lives of 7 hours, 5 hours and 12 hours respectively. In a mass balance study in 6 healthy volunteers, approximately 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine, and fecal recovery accounted for approximately 7 to 16% of the dose. Unchanged tetrabenazine has not been found in human urine. Urinary excretion of α-HTBZ or β-HTBZ accounted for less than 10% of the administered dose. Circulating metabolites, including sulfate and glucuronide conjugates of HTBZ metabolites as well as products of oxidative metabolism, account for the majority of metabolites in the urine.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span> </p><p><span class="Italics">Gender</span> </p><p>There is no apparent effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of α-HTBZ or β-HTBZ.  </p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment  </span></p><p>The disposition of tetrabenazine was compared in 12 patients with mild to moderate chronic liver impairment (Child-Pugh scores of 5 to 9) and 12 age- and gender-matched subjects with normal hepatic function who received a single 25 mg dose of tetrabenazine. In patients with hepatic impairment, tetrabenazine plasma concentrations were similar to or higher than concentrations of α-HTBZ, reflecting the markedly decreased metabolism of tetrabenazine to α-HTBZ. The mean tetrabenazine C<span class="Sub">max</span> in subjects with hepatic impairment was approximately 7- to 190-fold higher than the detectable peak concentrations in healthy subjects. The elimination half-life of tetrabenazine in subjects with hepatic impairment was approximately 17.5 hours. The time to peak concentrations (t<span class="Sub">max</span>) of α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ was slightly delayed in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to age-matched controls (1.75 hrs vs. 1.0 hrs), and the elimination half-lives of the α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ were prolonged to approximately 10 and 8 hours, respectively. The exposure to α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ was approximately 30 to 39% greater in patients with liver impairment than in age-matched controls. The safety and efficacy of this increased exposure to tetrabenazine and other circulating metabolites are unknown so that it is not possible to adjust the dosage of tetrabenazine in hepatic impairment to ensure safe use. Therefore, tetrabenazine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.  </p><p><span class="Italics">Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers</span> </p><p>Although the pharmacokinetics of tetrabenazine and its metabolites in patients who do not express the drug metabolizing enzyme, CYP2D6, poor metabolizers, (PMs), have not been systematically evaluated, it is likely that the exposure to α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ would be increased similar to that observed in patients taking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (3- and 9-fold, respectively) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span>.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span> </p><p><span class="Italics">CYP2D6 Inhibitors</span> </p><p>In vitro studies indicate that α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ are substrates for CYP2D6.

There was an approximately 30% increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and an approximately 3-fold increase in AUC for α-HTBZ in subjects given paroxetine prior to tetrabenazine compared to tetrabenazine given alone. For β-HTBZ, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC were increased 2.4- and 9-fold, respectively, in subjects given paroxetine prior to tetrabenazine given alone. The elimination half-life of α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ was approximately 14 hours when tetrabenazine was given with paroxetine.  </p><p>Strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine) markedly increase exposure to these metabolites. The effect of moderate or weak CYP2D6 inhibitors such as duloxetine, terbinafine, amiodarone, or sertraline on the exposure to tetrabenazine and its metabolites has not been evaluated <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span>.  </p><p><span class="Italics">Digoxin</span> </p><p>Digoxin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein.
