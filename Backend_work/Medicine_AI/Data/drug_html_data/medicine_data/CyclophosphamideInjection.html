</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Cyclophosphamide Injection</h2><h3>Malignant Diseases</h3><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide is indicated for the treatment of:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma</li>
<li>multiple myeloma</li>
<li>leukemias: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia (cyclophosphamide given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration)</li>
<li>mycosis fungoides (advanced disease)</li>
<li>neuroblastoma (disseminated disease)</li>
<li>adenocarcinoma of the ovary</li>
<li>retinoblastoma</li>
<li>carcinoma of the breast</li>
</ul><p>Cyclophosphamide, although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially with other antineoplastic drugs.</p><h2>Cyclophosphamide Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">During or immediately after the administration, adequate amounts of fluid should be ingested or infused to force diuresis in order to reduce the risk of urinary tract toxicity. Therefore, cyclophosphamide should be administered in the morning.</p><h3>Dosing for Malignant Diseases</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adults and Pediatric Patients</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Intravenous</span></p><p>When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of cyclophosphamide for patients with no hematologic deficiency usually consists of 40 mg per kg to 50 mg per kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens include 10 mg per kg to 15 mg per kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 mg per kg to 5 mg per kg twice weekly.</p><p>When cyclophosphamide is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose of cyclophosphamide as well as that of the other drugs.</p><h3>Preparation, Handling and Administration</h3><p class="First">Handle and dispose of cyclophosphamide in a manner consistent with other cytotoxic drugs.<span class="Sup">1</span> Caution should be exercised when handling and preparing Cyclophosphamide Injection. To minimize the risk of dermal exposure, always wear gloves when handling vials containing Cyclophosphamide Injection.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cyclophosphamide Injection</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Intravenous Administration</span></p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p><p>Cyclophosphamide does not contain any antimicrobial preservative and thus care must be taken to assure the sterility of prepared solutions. Use aseptic technique.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">For Direct Intravenous Injection</span></p><p>Aseptically withdraw the prescribed dose from the vial. Dilute the prescribed dose of Cyclophosphamide Injection to a minimum concentration of 20 mg per mL by using any of the following diluents:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP</li>
<li>0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP</li>
<li>5% Dextrose Injection, USP</li>
<li>5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP</li>
</ul><p>Do not use Sterile Water for Injection, USP because it results in a hypotonic solution and should not be injected directly.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">For Intravenous Infusion</span></p><p>Aseptically withdraw the prescribed dose from the vial. Dilute the prescribed dose of Cyclophosphamide Injection to a minimum concentration of 2 mg per mL by using any of the following diluents.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP</li>
<li>0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP</li>
<li>5% Dextrose Injection, USP</li>
<li>5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP</li>
</ul><p>To reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions that appear to be administration rate-dependent (e.g., facial swelling, headache, nasal congestion, scalp burning), cyclophosphamide should be injected or infused very slowly. Duration of the infusion also should be appropriate for the volume and type of carrier fluid to be infused.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Storage of Diluted Cyclophosphamide Solution:</span></p><p>If not used immediately, for microbiological integrity, cyclophosphamide solutions should be stored as described in Table 1:</p><p>After first use, the partially used vial should be stored in the refrigerator in the original carton at 2°C to 8°C (36ºF to 46°F). Should be used within 28 days and rest of the content need to be discarded.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide Injection is a 200 mg per mL sterile clear colorless ready to dilute solution in a multiple-dose vial available in the following presentations:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>500 mg per 2.5 mL</li>
<li>1 gram per 5 mL</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>Hypersensitivity
<p class="First">Cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to it, any of its metabolites, or to other components of the product. Anaphylactic reactions including death have been reported with cyclophosphamide. Possible cross-sensitivity with other alkylating agents can occur.</p>
</li>
<li>Urinary Outflow Obstruction
<p class="First">Cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in patients with urinary outflow obstruction <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p>

</ul><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to it, any of its metabolites, or to other components of the product. Anaphylactic reactions including death have been reported with cyclophosphamide. Possible cross-sensitivity with other alkylating agents can occur.</p><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in patients with urinary outflow obstruction <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myelosuppression, Immunosuppression, Bone Marrow Failure and Infections</h3><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide can cause myelosuppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia), bone marrow failure, and severe immunosuppression which may lead to serious and sometimes fatal infections, including sepsis and septic shock. Latent infections can be reactivated <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><p>Antimicrobial prophylaxis may be indicated in certain cases of neutropenia at the discretion of the managing physician. In case of neutropenic fever, antibiotic therapy is indicated. Antimycotics and/or antivirals may also be indicated.</p><p>Monitoring of complete blood counts is essential during cyclophosphamide treatment so that the dose can be adjusted, if needed. Cyclophosphamide should not be administered to patients with neutrophils ≤1,500/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> and platelets &lt; 50,000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop a serious infection. G-CSF may be administered to reduce the risks of neutropenia complications associated with cyclophosphamide use. Primary and secondary prophylaxis with G-CSF should be considered in all patients considered to be at increased risk for neutropenia complications. The nadirs of the reduction in leukocyte count and thrombocyte count are usually reached in weeks 1 and 2 of treatment. Peripheral blood cell counts are expected to normalize after approximately 20 days. Bone marrow failure has been reported. Severe myelosuppression may be expected particularly in patients pretreated with and/or receiving concomitant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.</p><h3>Urinary Tract and Renal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Hemorrhagic cystitis, pyelitis, ureteritis, and hematuria have been reported with cyclophosphamide. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in case of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Urotoxicity (bladder ulceration, necrosis, fibrosis, contracture and secondary cancer) may require interruption of cyclophosphamide treatment or cystectomy. Urotoxicity can be fatal. Urotoxicity can occur with short-term or long-term use of cyclophosphamide.</p><p>Before starting treatment, exclude or correct any urinary tract obstructions <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Urinary sediment should be checked regularly for the presence of erythrocytes and other signs of urotoxicity and/or nephrotoxicity. Cyclophosphamide should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active urinary tract infections. Aggressive hydration with forced diuresis and frequent bladder emptying can reduce the frequency and severity of bladder toxicity. Mesna has been used to prevent severe bladder toxicity.</p><h3>Cardiotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Myocarditis, myopericarditis, pericardial effusion including cardiac tamponade, and congestive heart failure, which may be fatal, have been reported with cyclophosphamide therapy.</p><p>Supraventricular arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation and flutter) and ventricular arrhythmias (including severe QT prolongation associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmia) have been reported after treatment with regimens that included cyclophosphamide.</p><p>The risk of cardiotoxicity may be increased with high doses of cyclophosphamide, in patients with advanced age, and in patients with previous radiation treatment to the cardiac region and/or previous or concomitant treatment with other cardiotoxic agents.</p><p>Particular caution is necessary in patients with risk factors for cardiotoxicity and in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease.</p><p>Monitor patients with risk factors for cardiotoxicity and with pre-existing cardiac disease.</p><h3>Pulmonary Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and other forms of pulmonary toxicity leading to respiratory failure have been reported during and following treatment with cyclophosphamide. Late onset pneumonitis (greater than 6 months after start of cyclophosphamide) appears to be associated with increased mortality. Pneumonitis may develop years after treatment with cyclophosphamide.</p><p>Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity.</p><h3>Secondary Malignancies</h3><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide is genotoxic <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span> Secondary malignancies (urinary tract cancer, myelodysplasia, acute leukemias, lymphomas, thyroid cancer, and sarcomas) have been reported in patients treated with cyclophosphamide-containing regimens. The risk of bladder cancer may be reduced by prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis.</p><h3>Veno-occlusive Liver Disease</h3><p class="First">Veno-occlusive liver disease (VOD) including fatal outcome has been reported in patients receiving cyclophosphamide-containing regimens. A cytoreductive regimen in preparation for bone marrow transplantation that consists of cyclophosphamide in combination with whole-body irradiation, busulfan, or other agents has been identified as a major risk factor. VOD has also been reported to develop gradually in patients receiving long-term low-dose immunosuppressive doses of cyclophosphamide. Other risk factors predisposing to the development of VOD include preexisting disturbances of hepatic function, previous radiation therapy of the abdomen, and a low performance status.</p><h3>Alcohol Content</h3><p class="First">The alcohol content in a dose of Cyclophosphamide Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in Cyclophosphamide Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. Each administration of Cyclophosphamide Injection at 50 mg per kg delivers 0.155 g/kg of ethanol. For a 75 kg patient this would deliver 11.625 grams of ethanol <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)].</span> Other cyclophosphamide products may have a different amount of alcohol or no alcohol.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on its mechanism of action and published reports of effects in pregnant patients or animals, Cyclophosphamide Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>. Exposure to cyclophosphamide during pregnancy may cause birth defects, miscarriage, fetal growth retardation, and fetotoxic effects in the newborn. Cyclophosphamide is teratogenic and embryo-fetal toxic in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys.</p><p>Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of Cyclophosphamide Injection. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Cyclophosphamide Injection and for up to 1 year after completion of therapy. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Cyclophosphamide Injection and for 4 months after completion of therapy <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].</span></p><h3>Infertility</h3><p class="First">Male and female reproductive function and fertility may be impaired in patients being treated with Cyclophosphamide Injection. Cyclophosphamide interferes with oogenesis and spermatogenesis. It may cause sterility in both sexes. Development of sterility appears to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide, duration of therapy, and the state of gonadal function at the time of treatment. Cyclophosphamide-induced sterility may be irreversible in some patients. Advise patients on the potential risks for infertility <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.3 and 8.4)].</span></p><h3>Impairment of Wound Healing</h3><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide may interfere with normal wound healing.</p><h3>Hyponatremia</h3><p class="First">Hyponatremia associated with increased total body water, acute water intoxication, and a syndrome resembling SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone), which may be fatal, has been reported.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling.</p><ul class="Disc">

Cyclophosphamide is soluble in water, saline, or ethanol.</p><p>Cyclophosphamide Injection is a 200 mg per mL sterile clear colorless solution available as 500 mg and 1 gram strength vials.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>500 mg vial contains 534.5 mg cyclophosphamide monohydrate equivalent to 500 mg cyclophosphamide, 1.55 g Ethanol, 0.085 g Propylene Glycol, 0.085 g Polyethylene glycol 400 and 0.345 mg Monothioglycerol.</li>
<li>1 gram vial contains 1069.0 mg cyclophosphamide monohydrate equivalent to 1 g cyclophosphamide, 3.1 g Ethanol, 0.17 g Propylene Glycol, 0.17 g Polyethylene glycol 400 and 0.69 mg Monothioglycerol.</li>
</ul><h2>Cyclophosphamide Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action is thought to involve cross-linking of tumor cell DNA.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide is biotransformed principally in the liver to active alkylating metabolites by a mixed function microsomal oxidase system. These metabolites interfere with the growth of susceptible rapidly proliferating malignant cells.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Following IV administration, elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) ranges from 3 to 12 hours with total body clearance (CL) values of 4 to 5.6 L/h. Pharmacokinetics are linear over the dose range used clinically. When cyclophosphamide was administered at 4.0 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span> over a 90 minutes infusion, saturable elimination in parallel with first-order renal elimination describe the kinetics of the drug.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>Approximately 20% of cyclophosphamide is protein bound, with no dose dependent changes. Some metabolites are protein bound to an extent greater than 60%. Volume of distribution approximates total body water (30 to 50 L).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>The liver is the major site of cyclophosphamide activation. Approximately 75% of the administered dose of cyclophosphamide is activated by hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450s including CYP2A6, 2B6, 3A4, 3A5, 2C9, 2C18 and 2C19, with 2B6 displaying the highest 4-hydroxylase activity. Cyclophosphamide is activated to form 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, which is in equilibrium with its ring-open tautomer aldophosphamide. 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and aldophosphamide can undergo oxidation by aldehyde dehydrogenases to form the inactive metabolites 4-ketocyclophosphamide and carboxyphosphamide, respectively. Aldophosphamide can undergo β-elimination to form active metabolites phosphoramide mustard and acrolein. This spontaneous conversion can be catalyzed by albumin and other proteins. Less than 5% of cyclophosphamide may be directly detoxified by side chain oxidation, leading to the formation of inactive metabolites 2-dechloroethylcyclophosphamide. At high doses, the fraction of parent compound cleared by 4-hydroxylation is reduced resulting in non-linear elimination of cyclophosphamide in patients. Cyclophosphamide appears to induce its own metabolism. Auto-induction results in an increase in the total clearance, increased formation of 4-hydroxyl metabolites and shortened t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> values following repeated administration at 12- to 24-hour interval.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Elimination</span></p><p>Cyclophosphamide is primarily excreted as metabolites. 10 to 20% is excreted unchanged in the urine and 4% is excreted in the bile following IV administration.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Special Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide were determined following one-hour intravenous infusion to renally impaired patients. The results demonstrated that the systemic exposure to cyclophosphamide increased as the renal function decreased. Mean dose-corrected AUC increased by 38% in the moderate renal group, (Creatinine clearance (CrCl of 25 to 50 mL/min), by 64% in the severe renal group (CrCl of 10 to 24 mL/min) and by 23% in the hemodialysis group (CrCl of &lt; 10 mL/min) compared to the control group. The increase in exposure was significant in the severe group (p&gt;0.05); thus, patients with severe renal impairment should be closely monitored for toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><p>The dialyzability of cyclophosphamide was investigated in four patients on long-term hemodialysis. Dialysis clearance calculated by arterial-venous difference and actual drug recovery in dialysate averaged 104 mL/min, which is in the range of the metabolic clearance of 95 mL/min for the drug. A mean of 37% of the administered dose of cyclophosphamide was removed during hemodialysis. The elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) was 3.3 hours in patients during hemodialysis, a 49% reduction of the 6.5 hours to t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> reported in uremic patients. Reduction in t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>, larger dialysis clearance than metabolic clearance, high extraction efficiency, and significant drug removal during dialysis, suggest that cyclophosphamide is dialyzable.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Total body clearance (CL) of cyclophosphamide is decreased by 40% in patients with severe hepatic impairment and elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) is prolonged by 64%. Mean CL and t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> were 45 ± 8.6 L/kg and 12.5 ± 1.0 hours respectively, in patients with severe hepatic impairment and 63 ± 7.6 L/kg and 7.6 ± 1.4 hours respectively in the control group <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span>.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Cyclophosphamide administered by different routes, including intravenous, subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection, or in drinking water, caused tumors in both mice and rats.
