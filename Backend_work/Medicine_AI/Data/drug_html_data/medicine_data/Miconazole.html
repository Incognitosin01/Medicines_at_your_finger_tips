</ul><h2>Miconazole Description</h2><p class="First">Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories USP, 200 mg are white to off-white suppositories, each containing the antifungal agent, Miconazole nitrate, USP 1-[2,4-Dichloro-β-[(2,4- dichlorobenzyl)oxy] phenethyl]-imidazole mononitrate, 200 mg, in a hydrogenated vegetable oil base. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">14</span>Cl<span class="Sub">4</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O•HNO<span class="Sub">3</span>; the molecular weight is 479.14 and the structural formula may be represented as follows:</p><h2>Miconazole - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Miconazole nitrate exhibits fungicidal activity <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> against species of the genus <span class="Italics">Candida.</span> The pharmacologic mode of action is unknown. Following intravaginal administration of Miconazole nitrate, small amounts are absorbed. Administration of a single dose of Miconazole nitrate vaginal suppositories (100 mg) to healthy subjects resulted in total recovery from the urine and feces of 0<span class="Bold">.</span>85% (±0<span class="Bold">.</span>43%) of the administered dose.</p><p>Animal studies indicate that the drug crossed the placenta and doses above those used in humans result in embryo and fetotoxicity (80 mg/kg, orally), although this has not been reported in human subjects (See PRECAUTIONS).</p><p>In multi-center clinical trials in 440 women with vulvovaginal candidiasis, the efficacy of treatment with the Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories USP, 200 mg for 3 days was compared with treatment for 7 days with Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream 2%. The clinical cure rates (free of microbiological evidence and clinical signs and symptoms of candidiasis at 8 to 10 days and 30 to 35 days post therapy) were numerically lower, although not statistically different, with the 3-Day Suppository when compared with the 7-Day Cream.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Miconazole</h2><p class="First">Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories USP, 200 mg are indicated for the local treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (moniliasis). Effectiveness in pregnancy has not been established. As Miconazole nitrate is effective only for candidal vulvovaginitis, the diagnosis should be confirmed by KOH smear and/or cultures. Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis (<span class="Italics">Trichomonas</span> and <span class="Italics">Haemophilus vaginalis [Gardnerella]</span>) should be ruled out by appropriate laboratory methods.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Patients known to be hypersensitive to this drug.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Discontinue drug if sensitization or irritation is reported during use. The base contained in the suppository formulation may interact with certain latex products, such as that used in vaginal contraceptive diaphragms. Concurrent use is not recommended. Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream USP, 2% may be considered for use under these conditions.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">If there is a lack of response to Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories, appropriate microbiological studies (standard KOH smear and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies to determine carcinogenic potential have not been performed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Fertility (Reproduction):</span> Oral administration of Miconazole nitrate in rats has been reported to produce prolonged gestation. However, this effect was not observed in oral rabbit studies. In addition, signs of fetal and embryo toxicity were reported in rat and rabbit studies, and dystocia was reported in rat studies after oral doses at and above 80 mg per kg. Intravaginal administration did not produce these effects in rats.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Since imidazoles are absorbed in small amounts from the human vagina, they should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient.</p><p>Clinical studies, during which Miconazole nitrate vaginal cream and suppositories were used for up to 14 days, were reported to include 541 pregnant patients. Follow-up reports available in 471 of these patients reveal no adverse effects or complications attributable to Miconazole nitrate therapy in infants born to these women.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether Miconazole is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Miconazole nitrate is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">During clinical studies with Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories USP, 200 mg, 301 patients were treated. The incidence of vulvovaginal burning, itching or irritation was 2%. Complaints of cramping (2%) and headaches (1<span class="Bold">.</span>3%) were also reported. Other complaints (hives, skin rash) occurred with less than a 0<span class="Bold">.</span>5% incidence. The therapy-related dropout rate was 0<span class="Bold">.</span>3%.</p><p><span class="Bold">To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/ for voluntary reporting of adverse reactions.</span></p><h2>​OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">Overdosage of Miconazole nitrate in humans has not been reported to date. In mice, rats, guinea pigs and dogs, the oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> values were found to be 578<span class="Bold">.</span>1, greater than 640, 275<span class="Bold">.</span>9 and greater than 160 mg/kg, respectively.</p><h2>Miconazole Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories USP, 200 mg:</span> One suppository (Miconazole nitrate, 200 mg) is inserted intravaginally once daily at bedtime for three consecutive days.

It may be present in small and harmless amounts in the mouth, digestive track, and vagina. Sometimes the natural balance of the vagina becomes upset. This may lead to rapid growth of <span class="Italics">Candida,</span> which results in a yeast infection. Symptoms of yeast infection include itching, burning, redness, and an abnormal discharge. Your doctor can make the diagnosis of a yeast infection by evaluating your symptoms and looking at a sample of the discharge under the microscope.</p><p><span class="Bold">How can I prevent yeast infections?</span></p><p>Certain factors may increase your chance of developing a yeast infection. These factors don’t actually cause the problem, but they may create a situation that allows the yeast to grow rapidly.</p><p>Clothing: Tight jeans, nylon underwear, pantyhose, and wet bathing suits can hold in heat and moisture (two conditions in which yeast organisms thrive). Looser pants or skirts, 100% cotton underwear, and stockings may help avoid this problem.</p><p>Diet: Cutting down on sweets, milk products, and artificial sweeteners reduce the risk of yeast infections.</p><p>Antibiotics: Antibiotics work by eliminating disease-causing organisms. While they are helpful in curing other problems, antibiotics may lead to an overgrowth of <span class="Italics">Candida</span> in the vagina.</p><p>Pregnancy: Hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy encourage the growth of yeast. This is a very common time for an infection to occur. Until the baby is born, it may be hard to completely eliminate yeast infections. If you believe you are pregnant, tell your doctor.</p><p>Menstruation: Sometimes, monthly changes in hormone levels may lead to yeast infections.</p><p>Diabetes: In addition to heat and moisture, yeast thrives on sugar. Because diabetics often have sugar in their urine, their vaginas are rich in this substance. Careful control of diabetes may help prevent yeast infection.</p><p>Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back.</p><p><span class="Bold">Some other helpful tips:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION<br/></span> Contact Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. at 1-888-838-2872 or call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.
