</ul><p>Pharmacologic Class: Diuretic</p><p>Chemical Class: Thiazide</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Timolide</h2><p>Timolol and hydrochlorothiazide combination is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled .</p><p>Timolol is a beta-blocker. It works by affecting the response to some nerve impulses in certain parts of the body, like the heart. As a result, the heart beats slower and decreases the blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen is increased to the heart .</p><p>Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic (water pill). It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure .</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription .</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Timolide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of timolol and hydrochlorothiazide combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established .</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatrics-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of timolol and hydrochlorothiazide combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require an adjustment of dosage in patients receiving timolol and hydrochlorothiazide combination .</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.
