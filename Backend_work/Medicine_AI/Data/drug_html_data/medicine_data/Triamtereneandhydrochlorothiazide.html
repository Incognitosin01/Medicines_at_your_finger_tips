High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.</p><p>Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide are both diuretic medicines (water pills). They reduce the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure. Triamterene helps prevent your body from absorbing too much salt and keeps your potassium levels from getting too low.</p><p>Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide combination in geriatric patients. However, elderly patients are more likely to have kidney problems and high blood potassium (hyperkalemia), which may require caution in patients receiving triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide</h2><p><i>Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should not be the first medicine you use to treat your condition</i>. It is meant to be used only after you have tried other medicines that have not worked or have caused unwanted side effects.</p><p>In addition to the use of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide, treatment for your high blood pressure may include weight control and changes in the types of foods you eat, especially foods high in sodium (salt). Your doctor will tell you which of these are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet.</p><p>Many patients who have high blood pressure will not notice any signs of the problem. In fact, many may feel normal.

You must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. <i>You may have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life</i>. If high blood pressure is not treated, it can cause serious problems such as heart failure, blood vessel disease, stroke, or kidney disease.</p><p>Swallow the capsule whole. Do not break, crush, or chew it.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide will be different for different patients.

Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Make sure your doctor knows if you are also taking potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium, or certain diuretics such as amiloride (Midamor®, Moduretic®), spironolactone (Aldactazide®, Aldactone®), or other products containing triamterene. Using these medicines together may cause serious problems.</p><p>Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may increase the amount of potassium in your blood (hyperkalemia). Check with your doctor right away if you have stomach pain, confusion, irregular heartbeat, nausea or vomiting, nervousness, numbness or tingling in the hands, feet, or lips, trouble breathing, or weakness or heaviness of the legs.</p><p>Check with your doctor immediately if blurred vision, difficulty in reading, eye pain, or any other change in vision occurs during or after treatment. Your doctor may want you to have your eyes checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).</p><p>Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may affect blood sugar levels. Check with your doctor if you notice a change in the results of your blood or urine sugar tests.</p><p>Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may make you dizzy or drowsy. <i>Avoid driving, using machines, or doing anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert</i>. Dizziness may be worse if you lose too much water from your body. You can lose water by sweating, having diarrhea, or vomiting. Tell your doctor if triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide makes you feel lightheaded or dizzy after you have been vomiting or had diarrhea.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you experience drowsiness, fainting, confusion, muscle pain, weakness, and/or a fast heartbeat. Use extra care if you exercise or if the weather is hot. Heavy sweating can cause dehydration (loss of too much water) or electrolyte imbalances (loss of sodium, potassium, or magnesium in the body).</p><p>Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may increase your risk of getting skin cancer (eg, non-melanoma skin cancer). Avoid sun exposure. Use a sunscreen when you are outdoors. Avoid sunlamps and tanning beds. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.</p><p>Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may cause serious kidney problems, including kidney stones. Check with your doctor right away if you have lower back or side pain, decreased frequency or amount of urine, bloody urine, increased thirst, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, unusual tiredness or weakness, swelling of the face, fingers, or lower legs, weight gain, or trouble breathing.</p><p>Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide. You may need to stop using triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide several days before having surgery or medical tests. The results of some tests may be affected by triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes over-the-counter (nonprescription) medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems, since they may tend to increase your blood pressure.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
