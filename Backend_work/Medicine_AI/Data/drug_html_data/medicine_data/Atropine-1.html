This widens (dilates) your pupil so that it will not respond to light.</p><p>Atropine-1 (for the eye) is used to dilate your pupils when you have an inflammatory condition or in postsurgery situations in which this effect may be helpful.</p><p>Atropine-1 is also used in people with a condition called amblyopia (sometimes called "lazy eye"). This medicine can be placed into the stronger eye to temporarily blur the vision in that eye. This helps strengthen the weaker eye because the brain will force that eye to work harder to focus.</p><p>Atropine-1 may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use  Atropine-1 if you are allergic to atropine.
