</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Gastric Acid Secretion Inhibitor</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Esomeprazole</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Nexium</h2><p>Esomeprazole is used to treat conditions where there is too much acid in the stomach. It is used to treat duodenal and gastric ulcers, erosive esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a condition wherein the stomach produces too much acid. Esomeprazole is also used with antibiotics (eg, amoxicillin, clarithromycin) to treat ulcers that are caused by the H. pylori bacteria. This medicine is also used to prevent stomach ulcers and stomach irritation in patients taking NSAIDs (eg, aspirin, ibuprofen) for long periods of time.</p><p>Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by decreasing the amount of acid that is produced by the stomach.</p><p>This medicine is available both over-the-counter (OTC) and with your doctor’s prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Nexium</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

However, safety and efficacy have not been established for children younger than 1 month of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of esomeprazole in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding.
