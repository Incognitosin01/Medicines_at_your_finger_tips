Dystrophin is a protein that helps stabilize the structure of muscle tissue and is necessary for proper muscle development and function. Without dystrophin, muscle fibers can become weak and easily damaged. This can affect voluntary movement such as walking.</p><p>Children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy have a mutation of a gene that would normally cause the body to produce dystrophin.</p><p>Exondys 51 is used in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This medicine is not a cure for DMD, but  Exondys 51 may lessen muscle weakness and muscle wasting caused by this disease.</p><p>Exondys 51 was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on an "accelerated" basis.
