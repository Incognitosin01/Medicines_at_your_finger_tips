Daunomycin intercalates at points of local uncoiling of the double helix. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, it appears that direct binding to DNA (intercalation) and inhibition of DNA repair (topoisomerase II inhibition) result in blockade of DNA and RNA synthesis and fragmentation of DNA.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Distributes widely into tissues, particularly the liver, kidneys, lung, spleen, and heart; does not distribute into the CNS</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Primarily hepatic to daunorubicinol (active), then to inactive aglycones, conjugated sulfates, and glucuronides</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Feces (40%); urine (~25% as unchanged drug and metabolites)</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Initial: 45 minutes; Terminal: 18.5 hours; Daunorubicinol plasma half-life: ~27 hours</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Acute lymphocytic leukemia:</b> Treatment (remission induction) of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in children and adults (in combination with other chemotherapy)</p><p><b>Acute myeloid leukemia:</b> Treatment (remission induction) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults (in combination with other chemotherapy)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to daunorubicin or any component of the formulation</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Patients who exhibit myocardial lesions or those ≥75 years of age</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Cumulative doses above 550 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in adults without risk factors for cardiotoxicity and above 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in adults receiving chest irradiation are associated with an increased risk of cardiomyopathy.

Patients with preexisting heart disease, hypertension, concurrent administration of other antineoplastic agents, prior or concurrent chest irradiation, advanced age; and infants and children are at increased risk. Monitor left ventricular (LV) function (baseline and periodic) with ECHO or MUGA scan; monitor ECG.</p><p>ASCO has developed guidelines for prevention and monitoring of cardiac dysfunction in adult survivors of cancer (ASCO [Armenian 2017]). According to the guidelines, the risk of cardiac dysfunction is increased with the following:</p><p>• High-dose anthracycline therapy (eg, doxorubicin ≥250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, epirubicin ≥600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</p><p>• High-dose radiotherapy (≥30 Gy) with the heart in the treatment field</p><p>• Lower-dose anthracycline (eg, doxorubicin &lt;250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, epirubicin &lt;600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) in combination with lower-dose radiotherapy (&lt;30 Gy) with the heart in the treatment field</p><p>• Lower-dose anthracycline (eg, doxorubicin &lt;250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, epirubicin &lt;600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) or trastuzumab alone AND any of the following risk factors: Multiple cardiovascular risk factors (≥2 risk factors), including smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity (during or after completion of therapy), or older age (≥60 years of age) at cancer treatment, or compromised cardiac function (eg, borderline low LVEF [50% to 55%], history of MI, moderate or higher valvular heart disease) before or during treatment</p><p>• Treatment with lower-dose anthracycline (eg, doxorubicin &lt;250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, epirubicin &lt;600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) followed by trastuzumab (sequential therapy)</p><p>• Other risk factors for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity include ≥60 years of age at time of treatment and ≥2 cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, or obesity) during or after treatment.</p><p>The ASCO guidelines recommend a comprehensive assessment in patients with cancer that includes a history and physical examination, screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking. An echocardiogram should be obtained prior to initiating potentially cardiotoxic therapies. Modifiable risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity) should be actively managed before initiating potentially cardiotoxic therapies. Consider cardioprotectants (eg, dexrazoxane) or continuous infusions in patients who are likely to receive high-dose anthracycline therapy. In patients who develop signs/symptoms of cardiac dysfunction during therapy, an echocardiogram is recommended for diagnostic workup; if echocardiogram is not available or feasible, a cardiac MRI (preferred) or MUGA scan may be utilized. Serum cardiac biomarkers are recommended, along with referral to a cardiologist if indicated.</p><p>• Secondary malignancy: Secondary leukemias may occur when used with combination chemotherapy or radiation therapy.</p><p>• Tumor lysis syndrome: May cause tumor lysis syndrome and hyperuricemia. Urinary alkalinization and prophylaxis with an antihyperuricemic agent may be necessary. Monitor electrolytes, renal function, and hydration status.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Hepatic impairment:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Dosage reductions are recommended in patients with hepatic impairment;</b> significant hepatic impairment may result in increased toxicities.</p><p>• Renal impairment:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Dosage reductions are recommended in patients with renal impairment;</b> significant renal impairment may result in increased toxicities.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Elderly: Cardiotoxicity may occur more frequently in elderly patients. Use with caution in patients with impaired renal function and/or poor marrow reserve due to advanced age; dosage adjustment may be necessary.</p><p>• Pediatric: Infants and children are at increased risk for developing delayed cardiotoxicity; long-term periodic cardiac function monitoring is recommended. A panel from the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (ASPHO) and International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) recommends in favor of an anthracycline infusion duration of at least 1 hour in pediatric patients to reduce the potential for cardiotoxicity (ASPHO/SIOP [Loeffen 2018]). However, extravasation risks should also be minimized and the protocol infusion duration specified in a protocol should be followed, particularly if the patient is receiving dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant.</p><p>• Radiation recipients: Use with caution in patients who have received radiation therapy; reduce dosage in patients who are receiving radiation therapy simultaneously.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Formulations (conventional vs liposomal): Use caution when selecting product for preparation and dispensing; indications, dosages, and adverse event profiles differ between conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride solution and daunorubicin liposomal.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Experienced physician: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Should be administered under the supervision of an experienced cancer chemotherapy physician.</b></p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential and platelet count, liver function test, ECG, left ventricular ejection function (echocardiography [ECHO] or multigated radionuclide angiography [MUGA] scan), renal function test, signs/symptoms of extravasation</p><p><i>Cardiovascular monitoring (ASCO [Armenian 2017]):</i> Comprehensive assessment prior to treatment including a history and physical examination, screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking. Echocardiogram (prior to treatment). In patients who develop signs/symptoms of cardiac dysfunction during therapy, an echocardiogram is recommended for diagnostic workup; if echocardiogram is not available or feasible, a cardiac MRI (preferred) or MUGA scan may be utilized; obtain serum cardiac biomarkers.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Women of reproductive potential should avoid pregnancy.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Daunorubicin crosses the placenta.
