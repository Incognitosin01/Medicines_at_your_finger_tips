To mimic real life, the pediatric and adult patients and the caregivers were given minimal training, which included participants performing a supervised reconstitution and later performing a single unaided reconstitution. Healthcare providers were untrained in this study and could learn the procedure from the provided Instructions for Use. All participants were able to successfully and safely use the vial adapter device for reconstitution.</p><p><span class="Bold">Reconstitution</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Pooling</span></p><p>If the dose requires more than one vial, reconstitute each vial as described above with the diluent syringe provided. Use a larger plastic syringe (not provided) to combine the content of the vials into the syringe.</p><h3>Administration</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For intravenous use only.</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Kovaltry is available as a lyophilized powder in single-use glass vials containing nominally 250, 500, 1000, 2000, or 3000 IU of recombinant Factor VIII per vial.</p><p>Each vial of Kovaltry is labeled with actual Factor VIII potency expressed in IU determined using a chromogenic substrate assay. This potency assignment employs a Factor VIII concentrate standard that is referenced to the current WHO International Standard for Factor VIII concentrate, and is evaluated by appropriate methodology to ensure accuracy of the results.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Kovaltry is contraindicated in patients who have a history of hypersensitivity reactions to the active substance, to any of the excipients, or to mouse or hamster proteins <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible with Kovaltry. Early signs of hypersensitivity reactions, which can progress to anaphylaxis, may include chest or throat tightness, dizziness, mild hypotension and nausea. Discontinue Kovaltry if symptoms occur and seek immediate emergency treatment.</p><p>Kovaltry may contain trace amounts of mouse and hamster proteins <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)]</span>. Patients treated with this product may develop hypersensitivity to these non-human mammalian proteins.</p><h3>Neutralizing Antibodies</h3><p class="First">Neutralizing antibody (inhibitor) formation can occur following administration of Kovaltry. Previously untreated patients (PUPs) are at greatest risk for inhibitor development with all Factor VIII products <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Carefully monitor patients for the development of Factor VIII inhibitors, using appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If expected plasma Factor VIII activity levels are not attained or if bleeding is not controlled as expected with administered dose, suspect the presence of an inhibitor (neutralizing antibody) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Cardiovascular Risk Factors</h3><p class="First">Hemophilic patients with cardiovascular risk factors or diseases may be at the same risk to develop cardiovascular events as non-hemophilic patients when clotting has been normalized by treatment with Factor VIII.</p><h3>Catheter-related Infections</h3><p class="First">Catheter-related infections may be observed when Kovaltry is administered via central venous access devices (CVADs). These infections have not been associated with the product itself.</p><h3>Monitoring Laboratory Tests</h3><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical trials (≥3%) were headache, pyrexia, and pruritus (see Table 3).</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The safety profile of Kovaltry was evaluated in 193 previously treated patients (PTPs) (inclusive of 51 pediatric patients &lt;12 years of age) with at least three months of exposure to Kovaltry. The safety analysis was done using a pooled database from three multi-center, prospective, open-label clinical studies. The median time on study for patients ≥12 years of age was 372 days with a median of 159 exposure days (EDs). The median time on study for patients &lt;12 years of age was 182 days with a median of 73 EDs. Subjects who received Kovaltry for perioperative management (n=5) with treatment period of 2 to 3 weeks and those who received single doses of Kovaltry for PK studies (n=6) were excluded from safety analysis. Table 3 lists the adverse reactions reported during clinical studies. The frequency, type, and severity of adverse reactions in children are similar to those in adults.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Blood and the Lymphatic System Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Lymphadenopathy</p><p class="First">2 (1.0%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Palpitation</p><p>Sinus tachycardia</p><p class="First">2 (1.0%)</p><p>2 (1.0%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Abdominal pain</p><p>Abdominal discomfort</p><p>Dyspepsia</p><p class="First">4 (2.1%)</p><p>3 (1.6%)</p><p>4 (2.1%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions</span></p><p class="First">Pyrexia</p><p>Chest discomfort</p><p>Injection site reactions*</p><p class="First">8 (4.1%)</p><p>2 (1.0%)</p><p>5 (2.6%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Immune System Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Hypersensitivity</p><p class="First">1 (0.5%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nervous System Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Dizziness</p><p>Dysgeusia</p><p>Headache</p><p class="First">2 (1.0%)</p><p>1 (0.5%)</p><p>14 (7.3%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Psychiatric Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Insomnia</p><p class="First">5 (2.6%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Dermatitis allergic</p><p>Pruritus</p><p>Rash†</p><p>Urticaria</p><p class="First">2 (1.0%)</p><p>6 (3.1%)</p><p>5 (2.6%)</p><p>1 (0.5%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vascular disorders</span></p><p class="First">Flushing</p><p class="First">1 (0.5%)</p><p><span class="Bold">Immunogenicity</span></p><p>All clinical trial subjects were monitored for neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to Factor VIII by the modified Bethesda assay using blood samples obtained prior to the first infusion of Kovaltry, at defined intervals during the studies and at the completion visit.</p><p>Clinical trials (Phases 1 through 3) with Kovaltry evaluated a total of 204 pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with severe hemophilia A (Factor VIII &lt;1%) with previous exposure to Factor VIII concentrates ≥50 EDs, and no history of inhibitors.</p><p>In the completed studies, no PTP developed neutralizing antibodies to Factor VIII. In an ongoing extension study, a 13 year old PTP had a titer of 0.6 BU after 550 EDs concurrent with an acute infection and positive IgG anticardiolipin antibodies. The Factor VIII recovery was 2.2 IU/dL per IU/kg, annualized bleeding rate (ABR) was zero, and no change in therapy was required.</p><p>In an actively enrolling clinical trial in PUPs, 6 of 14 treated subjects (42.9% with a 95% Confidence Interval of 17.7-71.1%) developed an inhibitor. Of these, 3 subjects (21.4%) had high titer inhibitors, and 3 subjects (21.4%) had transient low titer inhibitors for which no change in therapy was required.</p><p>The detection of antibody formation is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, it may be misleading to compare the incidence of antibodies to Kovaltry with the incidence of antibodies to other products.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There are no data with Kovaltry use in pregnant women to inform on drug-associated risk. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted using Kovaltry. It is not known whether Kovaltry can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Kovaltry should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">There is no information regarding the presence of Kovaltry in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Kovaltry and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Kovaltry or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy studies with Kovaltry have been performed in pediatric PTPs. Body weight adjusted clearance of Factor VIII in children ≤12 years of age is higher than in adults and adolescents. Consider higher or more frequent dosing in children to account for this difference in clearance <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies with Kovaltry did not include patients aged 65 and over to determine whether or not they respond differently from younger patients. However, clinical experience with other Factor VIII products has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients. As with any patient receiving recombinant Factor VIII, dose selection for an elderly patient should be individualized.</p><h2>Kovaltry Description</h2><p class="First">Kovaltry, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, white to slightly yellow powder for reconstitution contained in a single-use vial. The final product does not contain any preservative. The reconstituted product is indicated for intravenous administration. The product is available in 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU, or 3000 IU nominal potencies; however, for each dosage strength the actual, assayed Factor VIII potency is directly printed on each vial label. The container closure system consists of a 10 mL, Type I glass vial sealed with a bromobutyl grey stopper and an aluminum crimp seal with plastic flip-off cap plus vial adapter. The vial adapter was designed to connect with the sterile water for injection (sWFI), prefilled diluent syringe. Kovaltry is formulated with the following excipients: 2.2% glycine, 1% sucrose, 30 mM sodium chloride, 2.5 mM calcium chloride, 20 mM histidine and 80 ppm polysorbate 80. The pH of the reconstituted product is 6.6 to 7.0. Intravenous administration of sucrose contained in Kovaltry will not affect blood glucose level.</p><p>The active substance in Kovaltry is the unmodified full length recombinant Factor VIII glycoprotein comprising the human derived amino acid sequence. Post-translational modifications are similar to those of endogenous Factor VIII including glycosylation sites and sulfation of tyrosine sites. Manufacturing and quality controls ensure that both galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-Gal) and N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (NGNA) content are below the 1% limit of detection established for each analytical method.</p><p>Kovaltry is produced by a genetically engineered Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cell line into which the human Factor VIII gene was introduced together with the human heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) gene. HSP 70 is an intracellular protein that improves proper folding of the Factor VIII protein. While Kovaltry and Kogenate FS have the same protein backbone, human- and animal-derived raw materials are not added to the cell culture, purification, or formulation processes for Kovaltry. In the manufacturing process for Kovaltry, recombinant Factor VIII is secreted into cell culture medium and is purified from process- and product-related impurities using a series of chromatography and filtration steps. The production process incorporates two dedicated viral clearance steps: (1) a detergent treatment step for inactivation and (2) a 20 nanometer filtration step for removal of viruses and potential protein aggregates.</p><h2>Kovaltry - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Kovaltry temporarily replaces the missing clotting Factor VIII that is needed for effective hemostasis.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Plasma clotting time as measured by the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is prolonged in patients with hemophilia A. Treatment with Kovaltry normalizes the aPTT.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics (PK) of Kovaltry were investigated in PTPs (0 to 61 years of age) with severe Hemophilia A following administration of 50 IU/kg of Kovaltry. The PK parameters of Kovaltry are presented in Table 4 (one-stage clotting assay) and Table 5 (chromogenic substrate assay). The PK of Kovaltry were similar between single and repeat dosing (in 19 subjects following 6 to 12 months of prophylaxis).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Parameter [unit]</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">12 to 17 yrs (N=5)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">≥18 yrs<br/>

Immunocompetent subjects with severe hemophilia A (Factor VIII activity ≤1%) and no history of Factor VIII inhibitors were eligible for the trials.</p><p>Study 1: a multi-center, open-label, cross-over, uncontrolled, study in adolescent and adult (age ≥12 years to &lt;65 years) PTPs (≥150 EDs) evaluated the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of routine prophylaxis, and perioperative management of bleeding of Kovaltry (see Table 7). The primary efficacy variable was ABR. The prophylactic regimen was 20 to 50 IU/kg two or three times per week in which the dosing frequency was assigned by the investigator based on the subject’s individual requirements.</p><p>Study 2: a multi-center, open-label, cross-over, uncontrolled, randomized study in adolescent and adult (age ≥12 years to &lt;65 years) PTPs (≥150 EDs) evaluated the superiority of prophylaxis over on-demand treatment with Kovaltry over a one-year treatment period (see Table 7). The primary efficacy variable was ABR. The prophylactic regimen was 20 to 30 IU/kg two times per week or 30 to 40 IU/kg three times per week and the treatment group was assigned by randomization.</p><p>Study 3: a multi-center, open-label, uncontrolled study in pediatric (age ≤12 years) PTPs (≥50 EDs) evaluated the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of routine prophylaxis, and perioperative management of bleeding of Kovaltry (see Table 8). The primary efficacy variable was annualized number of total bleeds during routine prophylaxis that occurred within 48 hours following previous prophylaxis infusion. ABR during prophylaxis, independent of time of infusion, was also analyzed. The prophylactic regimen was 25 to 50 IU/kg at frequencies of either 2 times per week, 3 times per week or every other day and could be adapted to individual subject’s need by the investigator.</p><p>In all studies, treatments of breakthrough bleeds and perioperative management were at the investigator’s discretion based on standard of care.</p><p>A total of 204 subjects were enrolled in the completed clinical trials, 153 subjects ≥12 years of age and 51 subjects &lt;12 years of age.

Hemophilia A is an inherited bleeding disorder that prevents blood from clotting normally.</p><p>Kovaltry is used to treat and control bleeding in adults and children with hemophilia A. Your healthcare provider may give you Kovaltry when you have surgery. Kovaltry can reduce the number of bleeding episodes in adults and children with hemophilia A when used regularly (prophylaxis).</p><p>Kovaltry is not used to treat von Willebrand Disease.</p><p><span class="Bold">Who should not use Kovaltry?</span></p><p>You should not use Kovaltry if you</p><p><span class="Bold">What should I tell my healthcare provider before I use Kovaltry?</span></p><p><span class="Bold">What are the possible side effects of Kovaltry?</span></p><p>The common side effects of Kovaltry are headache, fever and itchy rash.</p><p>Allergic reactions may occur with Kovaltry. Call your healthcare provider right away and stop treatment if you get tightness of the chest or throat, dizziness, decrease in blood pressure, and nausea.</p><p>Your body can also make antibodies, called “inhibitors,” against Kovaltry, which may stop Kovaltry from working properly. Consult with your healthcare provider to make sure you are carefully monitored with blood tests for the development of inhibitors to Factor VIII.</p><p>These are not all the possible side effects with Kovaltry. You can ask your healthcare provider for information that is written for healthcare professionals.</p><p>Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.</p><p><span class="Bold">What are the Kovaltry dosage strengths?</span></p><p>Kovaltry with 2.5 mL or 5 mL Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) comes in five different dosage strengths labeled as International Units (IU): 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU, and 3000 IU.

Within this period, Kovaltry may be stored for a period of up to 12 months at temperatures up to +25°C or 77°F.</p><p>Record the starting date of room temperature storage clearly on the unopened product carton. Once stored at room temperature, do not return the product to the refrigerator. The product then expires after storage at room temperature for 12 months, or after the expiration date on the product vial, whichever is earlier. Store vials in their original carton and protect them from extreme exposure to light.</p><p>Administer reconstituted Kovaltry as soon as possible. If not, store at room temperature for no longer than 3 hours.</p><p>Throw away any unused Kovaltry after the expiration date.</p><p>Do not use reconstituted Kovaltry if it is not clear.</p><p><span class="Bold">What else should I know about Kovaltry and hemophilia A?</span></p><p>Finding veins for injections may be difficult in young children. When frequent injections are required, your healthcare provider may propose to have a device surgically placed under the skin to facilitate access to the bloodstream. These devices may result in infections.</p><p>Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed here. Do not use Kovaltry for a condition for which it is not prescribed. Do not share Kovaltry with other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have.</p><p>This leaflet summarizes the most important information about Kovaltry.
