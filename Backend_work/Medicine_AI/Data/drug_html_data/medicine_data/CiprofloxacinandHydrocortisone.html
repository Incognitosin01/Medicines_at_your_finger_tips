Prompt discontinuation of drug should occur if skin rash or other symptoms of hypersensitivity arise.</p><p>• Infection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including <i>C. difficile</i>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed &gt;2 months postantibiotic treatment. If superinfection occurs, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.</p><p>• Tendon inflammation/rupture: There have been reports of tendon inflammation and/or rupture with systemic fluoroquinolones. Exposure following otic administration is substantially lower than with systemic therapy. Discontinue at first sign of tendon inflammation or pain.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension and cardiovascular collapse (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; CDC, 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors, 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol with caution in neonates. See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For otic use only; not intended for injection or ophthalmic use.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this combination.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat ear infections.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
