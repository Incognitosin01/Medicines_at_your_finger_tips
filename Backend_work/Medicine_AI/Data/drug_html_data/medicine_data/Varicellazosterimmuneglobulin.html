Chickenpox is usually mild, but it can be serious or even fatal in young infants, in adults, and in people who have a weak immune system. It can lead to severe skin infection, breathing problems, brain damage, or death.</p><p>When varicella zoster virus becomes active again in an adult, it can cause herpes zoster (also called shingles) which causes painful blisters, skin infections, severe nerve pain, and hearing or vision problems that can last for months or years.</p><p>Chickenpox is spread from person to person through the air, or by coming into contact with the fluid from a chickenpox blister.</p><p>Varicella zoster immune globulin is used in adults, children, and babies (including newborn or premature infants) who could become severely ill from exposure to varicella zoster virus.  varicella zoster immune globulin is also for use in pregnant women.</p><p>Varicella zoster immune globulin is used after exposure in people who have already come into contact with varicella virus. This medicine can help keep symptoms of the virus from becoming severe or life-threatening.</p><p>This medicine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>Varicella zoster immune globulin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package.
