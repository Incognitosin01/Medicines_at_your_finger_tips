Use 2 forms of birth control, including a barrier form (condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, or contraceptive sponge) to prevent pregnancy while you are using  efavirenz and for at least 12 weeks after your last dose. <b>Tell your doctor if you become pregnant during treatment.</b></p><p><b>Hormonal contraception</b> (birth control pills, injections, implants, skin patches, and vaginal rings) <b>may not be effective enough to prevent pregnancy while you are taking efavirenz.</b></p><p>HIV can be passed to your baby if the virus is not controlled during pregnancy. Your name may be listed on a registry to track any effects of antiviral medicine on the baby.</p><p>Women with HIV or AIDS should not breast-feed a baby. Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk.</p><h2>How should I take efavirenz?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p><b>Efavirenz must be given in combination with other antiviral medications and it should not be used alone.</b> Your disease may become resistant to efavirenz if you do not take it in combination with other HIV medicines your doctor has prescribed.</p><p>Take efavirenz on an empty stomach at bedtime.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Swallow the <b>tablet</b> whole and do not crush, chew, or break it.</p><p>If you cannot swallow a capsule whole, open it and sprinkle the medicine into a spoonful of applesauce, yogurt, grape jelly, or infant formula (if you are giving the medicine to a baby). Swallow the mixture right away. Do not save it for later use.</p><p>After taking efavirenz using the sprinkle method, do not eat for the next 2 hours. If you give efavirenz mixed with infant formula to a baby, do not feed more formula for at least 2 hours afterward.</p><p>Efavirenz doses are based on weight in children. Your child's dose needs may change if the child gains or loses weight.</p><p>You will need frequent medical tests.</p><p>Take efavirenz regularly to get the most benefit. Skipping doses may increase the risk of your virus becoming resistant to antiviral medicine.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>This medicine may affect a drug-screening urine test and you may have false results. Tell the laboratory staff that you use efavirenz.</p><p>Use all HIV medications as directed and read all medication guides you receive. Do not change your dose or dosing schedule without your doctor's advice. Every person with HIV should remain under the care of a doctor.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at one time.</p><p>Get your prescriptions refilled before you run out of medicine completely.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking efavirenz?</h2><p>Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how  efavirenz will affect you. Your reactions could be impaired.</p><p>Drinking alcohol can increase certain side effects of efavirenz.</p><p>Using this medicine will not prevent your disease from spreading. Do not have unprotected sex or share razors or toothbrushes. Talk with your doctor about safe ways to prevent HIV transmission during sex.
