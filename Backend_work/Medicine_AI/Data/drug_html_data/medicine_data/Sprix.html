This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use. Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. NSAIDS cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

Recommended doses should not be exceeded, and the patient should be carefully monitored during treatment.

An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using this medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.
