</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span>: Sodium sulfacetamide is a sulfacetamide with antibacterial activity while sulfur acts as a keratolytic agent. Chemically sodium sulfacetamide is N-[(4-aminophenyl) sulfonyl]-acetamide, monosodium salt, monohydrate.</p><p>Each pad of <span class="Bold">Sulfatol<span class="Sup">TM</span> 10-4 (sodium sulfacetamide 10% and sulfur 4%) Cleansing Pads</span> is coated with a cleanser-based formulation contains 100mg of Sodium Sulfacetamide and 40mg of Sulfur. The cleanser base consists of: aloe, butylated hydroxytoluene, cetyl alcohol, disodium oleamido MEA sulfosuccinate, edetate disodium, fragrance, glycerin, glyceryl steartate/PEG-100 stearate, green tea, methylparaben, propylparaben, purified water, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, sodium thiosulfate, stearyl alcohol.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>: The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods-Fildes theory, which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth. While absorption through intact skin has not been determined, sodium sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine, largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours. The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown, but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of <span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes</span> and the formation of free fatty acids.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS:</span><span class="Bold">Sulfatol<span class="Sup">TM</span> 10-4 (sodium sulfacetamide 10% and sulfur 4%) Cleansing Pads</span> are indicated in the topical control of acne vulgaris, acne rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS: Sulfatol<span class="Sup">TM</span> 10-4 (sodium sulfacetamide 10% and sulfur 4%)</span><span class="Bold">Cleansing Pads</span> are contraindicated for the use by patients having known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, sulfur or any other component of this preparation. <span class="Bold">Sulfatol<span class="Sup">TM</span> 10-4 (sodium sulfacetamide 10% and sulfur 4%) Cleansing Pads</span> are not used by patients with kidney disease.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span> Although rare, sensitivity to sodium sulfacetamide may occur. Therefore, caution and careful supervision should be observed when prescribing this drug for patients who may be prone to hypersensitivity to topical sulfonamides. Systemic toxic reactions such as agranulocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, purpura hermorrhagica, drug fever, jaundice, and contact dermatitis indicate hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Particular caution should be employed if areas of denuded or abraded skin are involved.</p><p><span class="Bold">FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.</span> Keep away from eyes. Keep out of reach of children. Keep container tightly closed.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> General - If irritation develops, use of the product should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Patients should be carefully observed for possible local irritation or sensitization during long-term therapy. The object of this therapy is to achieve desquamation without irritation, but sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur can cause reddening and scaling of the epidermis. These side effects are not unusual in the treatment of acne vulgaris, but patients should be cautioned about the possibility.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span> - Avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, lips and mucous membranes. If accidental contact occurs, rinse with water. If excessive irritation develops, discontinue use and consult your physician.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</span> - Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PREGNANCY</span>: Category C - Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with <span class="Bold">Sulfatol<span class="Sup">TM</span> 10-4 (sodium sulfacetamide 10% and sulfur 4%) Cleansing Pads</span>.

However, small amounts of orally adminstered sulfonamides have been reported to be eliminated in human milk.
