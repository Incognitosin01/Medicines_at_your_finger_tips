Other HPV vaccines (Gardasil and Gardasil 9) are used in both females and males. This medication guide provides information only for Cervarix.</p><p>You may receive Cervarix even if you have already had a positive HPV test or abnormal pap smear in the past. However, this vaccine <b>will not treat</b> HPV-related cancers, and it <b>will not cure</b> HPV infection.</p><p>Cervarix only prevents diseases caused by HPV types 16 and 18. It will not prevent diseases caused by other types of HPV.</p><p>Cervarix is for use only in females, but other available HPV vaccines can be used in males. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends HPV vaccine for all boys and girls ages 11 or 12 years old. The vaccine is also recommended in teenage boys and girls who have not already received the vaccine or have not completed all booster shots.</p><p>Like any vaccine, the Cervarix may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive a booster vaccine if you have had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.</p><p>You may feel faint after receiving Cervarix. Some people have had seizure-like reactions after receiving this vaccine.</p><h2>Before receiving this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive a booster vaccine if you have had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.</p><p>To make sure Cervarix is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a weak immune system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an allergic to latex rubber; or</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul><p>a weak immune system;</p><p>an allergic to latex rubber; or</p><p>if you are being treated with cancer medicine, steroids, or other drugs that can weaken your immune system.</p><p>Cervarix is not expected to harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p>It is not known whether human papillomavirus vaccine passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><p>Cervarix will not protect against sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, HIV, syphilis, and trichomoniasis.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is Cervarix vaccine given?</h2><p>Cervarix is given as an injection (shot) into a muscle in your upper arm. You will receive this injection in a doctor's office or other clinic setting.</p><p>Cervarix is given in a series of 3 shots. You may have the first shot at any time as long as you are between the ages of 9 and 25 years old. Then you will need to receive a second dose 1 month after your first shot, and a third dose 6 months after your first shot.</p><p>Be sure you receive all recommended doses. If you do not receive the full series of vaccines, you may not be fully protected against the disease.</p><p>Cervarix should not be used in place of having a routine pelvic exam and Pap smear to screen for cervical cancer.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Contact your doctor if you will miss an Cervarix booster dose or if you get behind schedule. The next dose should be given as soon as possible. There is no need to start over.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of Cervarix is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while receiving Cervarix vaccine?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Human papillomavirus vaccine side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Cervarix:</b> hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving Cervarix. When you receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects.</p><p>You may feel faint after receiving Cervarix. Some people have had seizure-like reactions after receiving a human papilloma virus vaccine. Your doctor may want you to remain under observation during the first 15 minutes after the injection.</p><p>Developing cancer from HPV is much more dangerous to your health than receiving the vaccine to protect against it. However, like any medicine, Cervarix can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.</p><p>Common Cervarix side effects may include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>pain, swelling, or redness where the shot was given;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>headache, tired feeling;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>joint or muscle pain;</p>
</li>
