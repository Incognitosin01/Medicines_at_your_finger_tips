This medicine slows the activity of your brain and nervous system.</p><p>Nembutal Sodium is used short-term as a sedative to treat insomnia, or to cause you to fall asleep for surgery. This medicine is also used as an emergency treatment for seizures.</p><p>Nembutal Sodium may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use  Nembutal Sodium if you have a history of porphyria (a genetic enzyme disorder that causes symptoms affecting the skin or nervous system).</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use this medicine if you are allergic to Nembutal Sodium or other barbiturates (butabarbital, phenobarbital, Luminal, Seconal, and others), or if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a history of porphyria (a genetic enzyme disorder that causes symptoms affecting the skin or nervous system).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>a history of porphyria (a genetic enzyme disorder that causes symptoms affecting the skin or nervous system).</p><p>To make sure Nembutal Sodium is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>liver disease;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kidney disease;</p>
</li>

</ul><p>liver disease;</p><p>kidney disease;</p><p>temporary or chronic pain;</p><p>a history of addiction to phenobarbital or similar medicines (Valium, Xanax, Ativan, and others).</p><p>Using Nembutal Sodium during pregnancy could harm the unborn baby. <b>If you use this medicine while you are pregnant, your baby could become dependent on the drug.</b> This can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the baby after it is born. Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p>Nembutal Sodium can make birth control pills less effective. Ask your doctor about using a non-hormonal birth control (condom, diaphragm with spermicide) to prevent pregnancy.</p><p><b>Sedatives used during surgery may affect brain development in a child under 3, or an unborn baby whose mother receives this medicine during late pregnancy.</b> These effects may be more likely when the medicine is used for 3 hours or longer, or used for repeated procedures. Effects on brain development could cause learning or behavior problems later in life.</p><p>Negative brain effects from anesthesia have been seen in animal studies. However, studies in human children receiving single short uses of anesthesia have not shown a likely effect on behavior or learning. More research is needed.</p><p>In some cases, your doctor may decide to postpone a surgery based on these risks. Treatment may not be delayed in the case of life-threatening conditions, medical emergencies, or surgery needed to correct certain birth defects.</p><p>Ask your doctor for information about all medicines that will be used during your surgery, and how long the surgery will last.</p><p>Pentobarbital can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is  Nembutal Sodium given?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not use  Nembutal Sodium in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Nembutal Sodium may be habit-forming. <b>Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law.</p><p>Nembutal Sodium is injected into a muscle, or into a vein through an IV. A healthcare provider will usually give you this injection.</p><p>You may be shown how to use Nembutal Sodium at home. Do not give yourself this medicine if you do not understand how to use the injection and properly dispose of needles, IV tubing, and other items used.</p><p>When injected into a vein, Nembutal Sodium must be given slowly.</p><p>Your breathing, blood pressure, oxygen levels, kidney function, and other vital signs will be watched closely after you receive Nembutal Sodium in a hospital setting.</p><p>Do not use Nembutal Sodium if it has changed colors or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medication.</p><p>Use a disposable needle and syringe only once. Follow any state or local laws about throwing away used needles and syringes.

Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention if you think you have used too much of  Nembutal Sodium. <b>An overdose of pentobarbital can be fatal.</b></p><p>Overdose symptoms may include extreme drowsiness, weak or limp feeling, slow or shallow breathing, weak pulse, rapid heart rate, little or no urination, pinpoint or dilated pupils, feeling cold, or fainting.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking  Nembutal Sodium?</h2><p>Nembutal Sodium can cause side effects that may impair your thinking or reactions.
