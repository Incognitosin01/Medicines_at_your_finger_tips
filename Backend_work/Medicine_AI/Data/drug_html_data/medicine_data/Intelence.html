HIV causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</p><p>Intelence is not a cure for HIV or AIDS.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>In rare cases, Intelence can cause a condition that results in the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, leading to kidney failure. Call your doctor right away if you have unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness especially if you also have fever, unusual tiredness, and dark colored urine.</p><p>Intelence must be taken in combination with other HIV medications. However, some drugs can raise or lower your blood levels of etravirine. Intelence can also affect blood levels of certain other drugs. This can make your medicines less effective or increase side effects. TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT ALL OTHER MEDICINES YOU USE.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not take Intelence if you are allergic to etravirine.</p><p>To make sure you can safely take Intelence, tell your doctor if you have any liver disease, including hepatitis B or C.</p><p>Intelence must be taken in combination with other HIV medications.
