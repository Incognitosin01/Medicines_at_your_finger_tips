Polio is a life threatening condition because it can paralyze the muscles that help you breathe.</p><p>The polio vaccine is used to help prevent these diseases in children and adults.</p><p>This vaccine works by exposing you to a small dose of the virus, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>Polio vaccine is for use in adults and children who are at least 6 weeks old.</p><p>Like any vaccine, the polio vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive this vaccine if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any vaccine containing live or inactivated polio virus, or if you are allergic to 2-phenoxyethanol, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin, or polymyxin B.</p><p>You should not receive this vaccine if you have moderate or severe illness with a fever.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive this vaccine if:</p><ul>

You will receive this injection in a doctor's office or other clinic setting.</p><p>Polio vaccine is recommended for all children. It is also recommended for adults in the following situations:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>people who have never been vaccinated against polio;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people who travel to areas where polio is common;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people who handle polio virus in a laboratory or other setting; or</p>

</ul><p>people who have never been vaccinated against polio;</p><p>people who travel to areas where polio is common;</p><p>people who handle polio virus in a laboratory or other setting; or</p><p>people who treat patients who have polio.</p><p>Polio vaccine is given in a series of shots. Children should receive a total of 4 shots. The first shot is usually given when the child is 2 months old. The booster shots are then given at 4 months, 6 to 18 months, and then at 4 to 6 years of age.</p><p>Adults who have never been vaccinated against polio should receive a total of 3 shots. Booster shots should be given 1 to 2 months after the first shot, and then 6 to 12 months after the second shot.</p><p>Adults who may have received prior polio vaccine(s) should receive 1 or 2 shots, no matter how long it has been since the first vaccination(s).</p><p>Your individual booster schedule may be different from these guidelines. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by the health department of the state you live in.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Contact your doctor if you miss a booster dose or if you get behind schedule. The next dose should be given as soon as possible. There is no need to start over.</p><p>Be sure you receive all recommended doses of this vaccine. You may not be fully protected against disease if you do not receive the full series.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of this vaccine is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid before or after getting polio vaccine?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Polio vaccine side effects</h2><p>You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.</p><p>Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving this vaccine. When you receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shots caused any side effects.</p><p>Becoming infected with poliovirus is much more dangerous to your health than receiving the vaccine to protect against it.
