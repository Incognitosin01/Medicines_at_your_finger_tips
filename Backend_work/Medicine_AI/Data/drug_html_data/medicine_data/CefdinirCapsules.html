</ul><h2>Cefdinir Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Cefdinir Capsules, USP contain the active ingredient cefdinir, an extended-spectrum, semisynthetic cephalosporin, for oral administration. Chemically, cefdinir is [6R-[6α,7β (Z)]]-7-[[(2-amino-4  thiazolyl)(hydroxyimino)acetyl]amino]-3-ethenyl-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2- carboxylic acid. Cefdinir is a white to slightly brownish-yellow solid. It is slightly soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid and sparingly soluble in 0.1 M pH 7.0 phosphate buffer.The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">13</span>N<span class="Sub">5</span>O<span class="Sub">5</span>S<span class="Sub">2</span> and the molecular weight is 395.42. Cefdinir has the structural formula shown below:<br/>
</p><p>Cefdinir Capsules, USP contain 300 mg cefdinir and the following inactive ingredients:</p><p>carboxymethylcellulose calcium, polyoxyl 40 stearate, colloidal silicone dioxide and magnesium stearate.</p><p>The capsule shells contain FD&amp;C Blue #2; gelatin, titanium dioxide, gelatin and water. Imprinting ink components shellac, Black Iron Oxide and potassium hydroxide.</p><h2>Cefdinir Capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism</h3><p class="First">Absorption</p><p><span class="Italics">Oral Bioavailability</span> </p><p>Maximal plasma cefdinir concentrations occur 2 to 4 hours postdose following capsule or suspension administration. Plasma cefdinir concentrations increase with dose, but the increases are less than dose-proportional from 300 mg (7 mg/kg) to 600 mg (14 mg/kg). Following administration of suspension to healthy adults, cefdinir bioavailability is 120% relative to capsules. Estimated bioavailability of Cefdinir Capsules is 21% following administration of a 300 mg capsule dose, and 16% following administration of a 600 mg capsule dose. Estimated absolute bioavailability of cefdinir suspension is 25%.<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Food</span><br/>
<br/></p><p>The C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of cefdinir from the capsules are reduced by 16% and 10%, respectively, when given with a high-fat meal. In adults given the 250 mg/5 mL oral suspension with a high-fat meal, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of cefdinir are reduced by 44% and 33%, respectively. The magnitude of these reductions is not likely to be clinically significant. Therefore, cefdinir may be taken without regard to food</p><p><span class="Italics">Cefdinir Capsules</span><br/>
<br/></p><p>Cefdinir plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameter values following administration of single 300 and 600 mg oral doses of cefdinir to adult subjects are presented in the following table:<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Mean (±SD) Plasma Cefdinir </span><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetic Parameter Values </span>Following Administration of Capsules to Adult Subjects</p><p><span class="Italics">Multiple Dosing</span></p><p>Cefdinir does not accumulate in plasma following once- or twice-daily administration to subjects with normal renal function.<br/>
<br/></p><p>Distribution<br/>
<br/></p><p>The mean volume of distribution (Vd<span class="Sub">area</span> ) of cefdinir in adult subjects is 0.35 L/kg (±0.29); in pediatric subjects (age 6 months to 12 years), cefdinir Vd<span class="Sub">area</span> is 0.67 L/kg (±0.38). Cefdinir is 60% to 70% bound to plasma proteins in both adult and pediatric subjects; binding is independent of concentration.<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Skin Blister</span><br/>
<br/></p><p>In adult subjects, median (range) maximal blister fluid cefdinir concentrations of 0.65 (0.33 to 1.1) and 1.1 (0.49 to 1.9) mcg/mL were observed 4 to 5 hours following administration of 300 and 600 mg doses, respectively. Mean (±SD) blister C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC (0-∞) values were 48% (±13) and 91% (±18) of corresponding plasma values.<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Tonsil Tissue<br/>
<br/></span></p><p>In adult patients undergoing elective tonsillectomy, respective median tonsil tissue cefdinir concentrations 4 hours after administration of single 300 and 600 mg doses were 0.25 (0.22 to 0.46) and 0.36 (0.22 to 0.80) mcg/g. Mean tonsil tissue concentrations were 24% (±8) of corresponding plasma concentrations.<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Sinus Tissue<br/>
<br/></span></p><p>In adult patients undergoing elective maxillary and ethmoid sinus surgery, respective median sinus tissue cefdinir concentrations 4 hours after administration of single 300 and 600 mg doses were &lt; 0.12 (&lt; 0.12 to 0.46) and 0.21 (&lt; 0.12 to 2.0) mcg/g. Mean sinus tissue concentrations were 16% (±20) of corresponding plasma concentrations.<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Lung Tissue<br/>
<br/></span></p><p>In adult patients undergoing diagnostic bronchoscopy, respective median bronchial mucosa cefdinir concentrations 4 hours after administration of single 300 and 600 mg doses were 0.78 (&lt; 0.06 to 1.33) and 1.14 (&lt; 0.06 to 1.92) mcg/mL, and were 31% (±18) of corresponding plasma concentrations. Respective median epithelial lining fluid concentrations were 0.29 (&lt; 0.3 to 4.73) and 0.49 (&lt; 0.3 to 0.59) mcg/mL, and were 35% (±83) of corresponding plasma concentrations.<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Middle Ear Fluid</span><br/>
<br/></p><p>In 14 pediatric patients with acute bacterial otitis media, respective median middle ear fluid cefdinir concentrations 3 hours after administration of single 7 and 14 mg/kg doses were 0.21 (&lt; 0.09 to 0.94) and 0.72 (0.14 to 1.42) mcg/mL. Mean middle ear fluid concentrations were 15% (±15) of corresponding plasma concentrations.<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">CSF<br/>
<br/></span></p><p>Data on cefdinir penetration into human cerebrospinal fluid are not available.<br/>
<br/></p><p>Metabolism and Excretion<br/>
<br/></p><p>Cefdinir is not appreciably metabolized. Activity is primarily due to parent drug. Cefdinir is eliminated principally via renal excretion with a mean plasma elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> ) of 1.7 (±0.6) hours. In healthy subjects with normal renal function, renal clearance is 2.0 (±1.0) mL/min/kg, and apparent oral clearance is 11.6 (±6.0) and 15.5 (±5.4) mL/min/kg following doses of 300 and 600 mg, respectively. Mean percent of dose recovered unchanged in the urine following 300 and 600 mg doses is 18.4% (±6.4) and 11.6% (±4.6), respectively. Cefdinir clearance is reduced in patients with renal dysfunction (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Special Populations:</span></span> Patients with Renal Insufficiency).<br/>
<br/></p><p>Because renal excretion is the predominant pathway of elimination, dosage should be adjusted in patients with markedly compromised renal function or who are undergoing hemodialysis (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).<br/>
<br/></span></p><p>Special Populations<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Insufficiency<br/>
<br/></span></p><p>Cefdinir pharmacokinetics were investigated in 21 adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Decreases in cefdinir elimination rate, apparent oral clearance (CL/F), and renal clearance were approximately proportional to the reduction in creatinine clearance (CL<span class="Sub">cr</span> ). As a result, plasma cefdinir concentrations were higher and persisted longer in subjects with renal impairment than in those without renal impairment. In subjects with CL<span class="Sub">cr</span> between 30 and 60 mL/min, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> increased by approximately 2-fold and AUC by approximately 3-fold. In subjects with CL<span class="Sub">cr</span>&lt;30 mL/min, C<span class="Sub">max</span> increased by approximately 2-fold, t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> by approximately 5-fold, and AUC by approximately 6-fold. Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with markedly compromised renal function (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min; see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).<br/>
<br/></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Hemodialysis</span><br/>
<br/></p><p>Cefdinir pharmacokinetics were studied in 8 adult subjects undergoing hemodialysis. Dialysis (4 hours duration) removed 63% of cefdinir from the body and reduced apparent elimination t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> from 16 (±3.5) to 3.2 (±1.2) hours. Dosage adjustment is recommended in this patient population (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</span><br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Disease<br/>
<br/></span></p><p>Because cefdinir is predominantly renally eliminated and not appreciably metabolized, studies in patients with hepatic impairment were not conducted. It is not expected that dosage adjustment will be required in this population.<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Geriatric Patients<br/>
<br/></span></p><p>The effect of age on cefdinir pharmacokinetics after a single 300 mg dose was evaluated in 32 subjects 19 to 91 years of age. Systemic exposure to cefdinir was substantially increased in older subjects (N=16), C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 44% and AUC by 86%. This increase was due to a reduction in cefdinir clearance. The apparent volume of distribution was also reduced, thus no appreciable alterations in apparent elimination t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> were observed (elderly: 2.2 ± 0.6 hours vs young: 1.8 ± 0.4 hours). Since cefdinir clearance has been shown to be primarily related to changes in renal function rather than age, elderly patients do not require dosage adjustment unless they have markedly compromised renal function (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min, see <span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Insufficiency</span>, above).<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Gender and Race<br/>
<br/></span></p><p>The results of a meta-analysis of clinical pharmacokinetics (N=217) indicated no significant impact of either gender or race on cefdinir pharmacokinetics.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">Mechanism of Action</p><p>As with other cephalosporins, bactericidal activity of cefdinir results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Cefdinir is stable in the presence of some, but not all, β-lactamase enzymes. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalosporins are susceptible to cefdinir.</p><p>Mechanism of Resistance</p><p>Resistance to cefdinir is primarily through hydrolysis by some β-lactamases, alteration of penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) and decreased permeability. Cefdinir is inactive against most strains of <span class="Italics">Enterobacter</span> spp., <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas</span> spp., <span class="Italics">Enterococcus</span> spp., penicillin-resistant streptococci, and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. β-lactamase negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) <span class="Italics">H. influenza</span> strains are typically non-susceptible to cefdinir. </p><p>Antimicrobial Activity</p><p>Cefdinir has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections as described in</p><p><span class="Bold"> INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Gram-Po</span><span class="Bold">sitive Bacteria</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (methicillin-susceptible strains only) <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> (penicillin-susceptible strains only) <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Gram-Neg</span><span class="Bold">ative Bacteria</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus parainfluenza</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</span></p><p>The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.</p><p>Cefdinir exhibits <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 1 mcg/mL or less against (≥ 90%) strains of the following microorganisms; however, the safety and effectiveness of cefdinir in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gram-Po</span><span class="Bold">sitive Bacteria</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> (methicillin-susceptible strains only) </p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus agalactiae</span> </p><p>  Viridans group streptococci</p><p><span class="Bold">Gram-Neg</span><span class="Bold">ative Bacteria</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Citrobacter koseri</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span> </p><p> <span class="Italics">Proteus mirabilis<br/></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Susceptibility Testing</span></p><p>For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC.</p><h2>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h2><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefdinir Capsules and other antibacterial drugs, Cefdinir Capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

IF CEFDINIR IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS-HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG β-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFDINIR OCCURS, THE DRUG SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, INTRAVENOUS ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefdinir, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>GENERAL PRECAUTIONS</h3><p class="First">Prescribing cefdinir in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><p>As with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged treatment may result in the possible emergence and over growth of resistant organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate alternative therapy should be administered.</p><p>Cefdinir, as with other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (antibiotics), should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of colitis.</p><p>In patients with transient or persistent renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min), the total daily dose of cefdinir should be reduced because high and prolonged plasma concentrations of cefdinir can result following recommended doses (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h3>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</h3><p class="First">Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including cefdinir should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When cefdinir is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cefdinir or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Antacids containing magnesium or aluminum interfere with the absorption of cefdinir. If this type of antacid is required during cefdinir therapy, cefdinir should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the antacid.</p><p>Iron supplements, including multivitamins that contain iron, interfere with the absorption of cefdinir. If iron supplements are required during cefdinir therapy, cefdinir should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the supplement.</p><p>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><h3>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h3><p class="First">Antacids (Aluminum- or Magnesium-Containing)</p><p>Concomitant administration of 300 mg Cefdinir Capsules with 30 mL Maalox<span class="Sup">®</span> TC suspension reduces the rate (C<span class="Sub">max</span> ) and extent (AUC) of absorption by approximately 40%. Time to reach C<span class="Sub">max</span> is also prolonged by 1 hour. There are no significant effects on cefdinir pharmacokinetics if the antacid is administered 2 hours before or 2 hours after cefdinir. If antacids are required during cefdinir capsule therapy, cefdinir should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the antacid.</p><p>Probenecid</p><p>As with other β-lactam antibiotics, probenecid inhibits the renal excretion of cefdinir, resulting in an approximate doubling in AUC, a 54% increase in peak cefdinir plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> .</p><p>Iron Supplements and Foods Fortified With Iron</p><p>Concomitant administration of cefdinir with a therapeutic iron supplement containing 60 mg of elemental iron (as FeSO<span class="Sub">4</span> ) or vitamins supplemented with 10 mg of elemental iron reduced extent of absorption by 80% and 31%, respectively. If iron supplements are required during cefdinir therapy, cefdinir should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the supplement.</p><p>The effect of foods highly fortified with elemental iron (primarily iron-fortified breakfast cereals) on cefdinir absorption has not been studied.</p><p>There have been reports of reddish stools in patients receiving cefdinir. In many cases, patients were also receiving iron-containing products. The reddish color is due to the formation of a non absorbable complex between cefdinir or its breakdown products and iron in the gastrointestinal tract.</p><h3>DRUG &amp; OR LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS</h3><p class="First">A false-positive reaction for ketones in the urine may occur with tests using nitroprusside, but not with those using nitroferricyanide. The administration of cefdinir may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in urine using Clinitest®, Benedict’s solution, or Fehling’s solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix® or Tes-Tape®) be used. Cephalosporins are known to occasionally induce a positive direct Coombs’ test.</p><h3>CARCINOGENESIS &amp; MUTAGENESIS &amp; IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY</h3><p class="First">The carcinogenic potential of cefdinir has not been evaluated. No mutagenic effects were seen in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames) or point mutation assay at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase locus (HGPRT) in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells. No clastogenic effects were observed <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in the structural chromosome aberration assay in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells or <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>in the micronucleus assay in mouse bone marrow. In rats, fertility and reproductive performance were not affected by cefdinir at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (70 times the human dose based on mg/kg/day, 11 times based on mg/m2 /day).</p><h3>PREGNANCY</h3><p class="First">Teratogenic Effects</p><p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category B</span></p><p>Cefdinir was not teratogenic in rats at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (70 times the human dose based on mg/kg/day, 11 times based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> /day) or in rabbits at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (0.7 times the human dose based on mg/kg/day, 0.23 times based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> /day). Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain) was observed in rabbits at the maximum tolerated dose of 10 mg/kg/day without adverse effects on offspring. Decreased body weight occurred in rat fetuses at ≥ 100 mg/kg/day, and in rat offspring at ≥ 32 mg/kg/day. No effects were observed on maternal reproductive parameters or offspring survival, development, behavior, or reproductive function.</p><p>There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>LABOR &amp; DELIVERY</h3><p class="First">Cefdinir has not been studied for use during labor and delivery.</p><h3>NURSING MOTHERS</h3><p class="First">Following administration of single 600 mg doses, cefdinir was not detected in human breast milk.</p><h3>PEDIATRIC USE</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy in neonates and infants less than 6 months of age have not been established. Use of cefdinir for the treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis in pediatric patients (age 6 months through 12 years) is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults and adolescents, the similar pathophysiology of acute sinusitis in adult and pediatric patients, and comparative pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population.</p><h3>GERIATRIC USE</h3><p class="First">Efficacy is comparable in geriatric patients and younger adults. While cefdinir has been well-tolerated in all age groups, in clinical trials geriatric patients experienced a lower rate of adverse events, including diarrhea, than younger adults. Dose adjustment in elderly patients is not necessary unless renal function is markedly compromised (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Clinical Trials</p><p><span class="Italics">Cefdinir Capsules (Adult and Adolescent Patients)</span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>In clinical trials, 5093 adult and adolescent patients (3841 U.S. and 1252 non-U.S.) were treated with the recommended dose of Cefdinir Capsules (600 mg/day). Most adverse events were mild and self-limiting. No deaths or permanent disabilities were attributed to cefdinir. One hundred forty-seven of 5093 (3%) patients discontinued medication due to adverse events thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or definitely associated with cefdinir therapy. The discontinuations were primarily for gastrointestinal disturbances, usually diarrhea or nausea. Nineteen of 5093 (0.4%) patients were discontinued due to rash thought related to cefdinir administration.</p><p>In the U.S., the following adverse events were thought by investigators to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to Cefdinir Capsules in multiple-dose clinical trials (N=3841 cefdinir-treated patients):<br/>

Pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may begin during or after antibiotic treatment (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).<br/>
Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>and <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span>). If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued.</p><p>Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Information on cefdinir overdosage in humans is not available. In acute rodent toxicity studies, a single oral 5600 mg/kg dose produced no adverse effects. Toxic signs and symptoms following overdosage with other β-lactam antibiotics have included nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, diarrhea, and convulsions. Hemodialysis removes cefdinir from the body. This may be useful in the event of a serious toxic reaction from overdosage, particularly if renal function is compromised.</p><h2>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">(see <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span> for Indicated Pathogens)<br/>
 The recommended dosage and duration of treatment for infections in adults and adolescents are described in the following chart; the total daily dose for all infections is 600 mg. Once-daily dosing for 10 days is as effective as b.i.d. dosing. Once-daily dosing has not been studied in pneumonia or skin infections; therefore, Cefdinir Capsules should be administered twice daily in these infections. Cefdinir Capsules may be taken without regard to meals.<br/>
 Adults and Adolescents (Age 13 Years and Older)<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Renal Insufficiency<br/></span> For adult patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min, the dose of cefdinir should be 300 mg given once daily.<br/>
Creatinine clearance is difficult to measure in outpatients. However, the following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance (CL<span class="Sub">cr</span> ) in adult patients. For estimates to be valid, serum creatinine levels should reflect steady-state levels of renal function.<br/>
<br/></p><p> The following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance in pediatric patients:<br/>
<br/></p><p> In the above equation, creatinine clearance is in mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>, body length or height is in centimeters, and serum creatinine is in mg/dL.</p><p> For pediatric patients with a creatinine clearance of &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>, the dose of cefdinir should be 7 mg/kg (up to 300 mg) given once daily.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Patients on Hemodialysis<br/></span> Hemodialysis removes cefdinir from the body. In patients maintained on chronic hemodialysis, the recommended initial dosage regimen is a 300 mg or 7 mg/kg dose every other day. At the conclusion of each hemodialysis session, 300 mg (or 7 mg/kg) should be given. Subsequent doses (300 mg or 7 mg/kg) are then administered every other day.</p><h2>How is Cefdinir Capsules Supplied</h2><p class="First">Cefdinir Capsules USP, containing 300 mg cefdinir, having off white to light yellow colour granular powder filled in size “0” hard gelatin capsules, blue opaque cap imprinted “A041” with black ink and blue opaque body imprinted “300” with black ink and are supplied as follows:</p><p>NDC 67877-543-60 in bottles of 60 capsules</p><p>NDC 67877-543-01 in bottles of 100 capsules</p><p>NDC 67877-543-38 in unit dose cartons of 100 (10 x 10) capsule-blisters – 10 blisters packed in 1 carton.</p><p><span class="Bold">Store at 20 <span class="Sup">°</span> to 25<span class="Sup">°</span>C (68 <span class="Sup">°</span> to 77 <span class="Sup">°</span>F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].</span></p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumo nia</span> </p><p>In a controlled, double-blind study in adults and adolescents conducted in the U.S., cefdinir b.i.d. was compared with cefaclor 500 mg t.i.d..
