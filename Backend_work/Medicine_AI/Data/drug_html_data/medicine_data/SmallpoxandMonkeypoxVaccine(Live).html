Smallpox and monkeypox vaccine is a live, third-generation smallpox vaccine containing Modified Vaccinia Ankara, which is replication deficient and cannot cause disease in humans or reproduce in human cells.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Smallpox and monkeypox, prevention:</b> Prevention of smallpox and monkeypox disease in adults determined to be at high risk for smallpox or monkeypox infection.</p><p><b>Note: </b>Existing guidance for routine and postevent vaccination against smallpox are mostly specific to ACAM2000, a live vaccine containing replication-competent poxvirus strains. Consider the following Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) relevant guidance for the use of the live, replication-deficient vaccine (Jynneos) for routine vaccination of the following individuals (CDC [Petersen 2015]; CDC/ACIP [Petersen 2016]):</p><p>• Laboratory workers who directly handle cultures or animals that are contaminated or infected with replication-competent vaccinia virus, recombinant vaccinia viruses derived from replication-competent vaccinia strains, or related orthopoxviruses capable of causing infections in humans (eg, monkeypox, cowpox, variola) and are immunosuppressed (eg, atopic dermatitis, HIV infection with CD4 cell counts between 50 to 199 cells/mm<sup>3</sup><sub>,</sub> other immunocompromised state [solid organ transplantation within last 3 months, bone marrow transplant within the last 4 to 24 months, transplant recipients with active graft-versus-host disease, or current immunosuppressive therapy).</p><p>• Consideration may also be given for vaccination of health care personnel with allergy to the ACAM2000 vaccine or vaccine component who currently treat or anticipate treating patients with vaccinia virus infections or whose contact is limited to contaminated materials or administering ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine; adherence to appropriate infection prevention measures is also necessary.</p><p>For postevent smallpox vaccination, consider previous ACIP guidelines that recommend vaccination with a live, nonreplicating vaccine (eg, Jynneos) to patients exposed to smallpox virus and who are severely immunodeficient (eg, bone marrow transplant within the last 4 months, HIV with CD4 cell counts &lt;50 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, severe combined immunodeficiency, complete DiGeorge syndrome, other severely immunocompromised states requiring isolation). All other patients should receive postevent vaccination with a live, replication-competent vaccine (ACAM2000) (CDC [Petersen 2015]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>There are no contraindications listed in the manufacturer's labeling.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Smallpox and monkeypox, prevention (primary immunization):</b> SubQ: Two doses (0.5 mL per <b>dose</b>) separated by 4 weeks.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Allow to thaw and reach room temperature before use. Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is present (vaccine is a milky, light yellow to pale white suspension). Swirl gently for ≥30 seconds prior to use. Withdraw a 0.5 mL dose into a sterile syringe for injection.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>For SubQ administration only, preferably into the upper arm. Do not mix with other vaccines or injections; separate needles and syringes should be used for each injection. To prevent syncope-related injuries, patients should be vaccinated while seated or lying down (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2017]). US law requires that the date of administration, the vaccine manufacturer, lot number of vaccine, and the administering person's name, title, and address be entered into the patient's permanent medical record.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store intact vials frozen at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F) and in the original package to protect from light. Once thawed, the vaccine is stable for 12 hours when stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F); do not refreeze.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Atoltivimab, Maftivimab, and Odesivimab: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Live).

Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2017]).</p><p><i><b>Concurrent drug therapy issues: </b></i></p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) generally recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist. The ACIP prefers each dose of a specific vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer when possible (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2017]).</p><p>- For smallpox vaccine: May be given simultaneously with any inactive and most live vaccines. Varicella vaccine should be administered at least 4 weeks before or after smallpox vaccine, to help interpret any postvaccination rashes that may arise. Tuberculosis screening (purified protein derivative skin test) should be administered ≥1 month after smallpox vaccination, to avoid temporary false-negative test results.</p><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: For management of postexposure to smallpox virus, vaccination with the live, nonreplicating vaccine (eg, Jynneos) is recommended in patients who are severely immunodeficient (including HIV infection with CD4 cell counts between 50 to 199 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>)(CDC/ACIP [Petersen 2015]). However, for routine immunization in applicable individuals, consider deferring immunization during periods of severe immunosuppression (eg, patients receiving chemo/radiation therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy [including high-dose corticosteroids]); may have a reduced response to vaccination. In general, household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive all age-appropriate vaccines (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2017]; IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p><i><b>Dosage form specific issues:</b></i></p><p>• Gentamicin: Manufactured with gentamicin.</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2017]).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor for anaphylaxis and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2017]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Adverse events were not observed in animal reproduction studies following vaccine administration. Maternal smallpox or monkeypox infection is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes (Mbala 2017).</p><p>In general, live virus vaccines should not be used in pregnancy (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2017]). Refer to current guidelines for vaccinating pregnant females in pre-exposure and postevent settings.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to prevent smallpox and monkeypox disease.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
