Cabotegravir and rilpivirine are to be used without any other antiviral medicines to treat HIV.</p><p>Cabotegravir and rilpivirine are given as a daily "lead-in dose" to help determine that you can safely use a combination form of these medicines given as a monthly injection.</p><p>Cabotegravir and rilpivirine may also be given short-term in place of the monthly injectable combination if you plan to miss an injection by more than 7 days.</p><p>Cabotegravir and rilpivirine is for use in adults who have already used other antiviral HIV medications that have controlled their viral load. These medicines are not a cure for HIV or AIDS.</p><p>Cabotegravir may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Tell your doctor about all your current medicines and any you start or stop using.
