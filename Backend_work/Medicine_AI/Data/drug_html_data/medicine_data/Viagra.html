Another brand of sildenafil is Revatio, which is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension and improve exercise capacity in men and women. This page contains specific information for Viagra, not Revatio.</p><p>Do not take Viagra while also taking Revatio, unless your doctor tells you to.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Some medicines can cause unwanted or dangerous effects when used with Viagra. Tell your doctor about all your current medicines, especially riociguat (Adempas) and nitrates.</p><p>Do not take Viagra if you are also using a nitrate drug for chest pain or heart problems, including nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide mononitrate, and some recreational drugs such as "poppers". <b>Taking sildenafil with a nitrate medicine can cause a sudden and serious decrease in blood pressure.</b></p><p>Contact your doctor or seek emergency medical attention if your erection is painful or lasts longer than 4 hours. A prolonged erection (priapism) can damage the penis.</p><p>Stop using Viagra and get emergency medical help if you have sudden vision loss.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Viagra if you are allergic to sildenafil, or:</p><ul>

This has occurred in a small number of people taking sildenafil, most of whom also had heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or certain pre-existing eye problems, and in those who smoked or were over 50 years old. It is not clear whether sildenafil is the actual cause of vision loss.</p><p>Viagra is not expected to harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p>It is not known whether sildenafil passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><p>Do not give this medicine to anyone under 18 years old without medical advice.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take Viagra?</h2><p>Take Viagra exactly as it was prescribed for you. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Viagra is usually taken only when needed, 30 minutes to 1 hour before sexual activity. You may take it up to 4 hours before sexual activity. Do not take Viagra more than once per day.</p><p>Viagra can help you have an erection when sexual stimulation occurs. An erection will not occur just by taking a pill. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>During sexual activity, if you become dizzy or nauseated, or have pain, numbness, or tingling in your chest, arms, neck, or jaw, stop and call your doctor right away. You could be having a serious side effect of sildenafil.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Viagra is used as needed, you are not likely to miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What to avoid</h2><p>Drinking alcohol with this medicine can cause side effects.</p><p>Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may interact with sildenafil and lead to unwanted side effects.
