For children receiving their first dose at 12 to 47 months of age, either the MMRV combination vaccine or separate MMR and varicella vaccines can be used. The ACIP prefers administration of separate MMR and varicella vaccines as the first dose in this age group unless the parent or caregiver expresses preference for the MMRV combination. For children receiving the first dose at ≥48 months or their second dose at any age, use of MMRV is preferred. For children with a personal or family history of seizures, the ACIP recommends vaccination with separate MMR and varicella vaccines, as opposed to the MMRV combination vaccine (CDC/ACIP [Marin 2010]).</p><p><i>Canadian labeling (not in US labeling):</i> MMRV combination vaccine is approved for use in healthy children (Priorix-Tetra: 9 months to 6 years; ProQuad: 12 months to 6 years); may consider use in healthy children ≤12 years of age based upon prior experience with the separate component (live-attenuated MMR or live-attenuated varicella [OKA-strain]) vaccines.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p><i>US labeling:</i> Hypersensitivity to this vaccine, measles-, mumps-, rubella-, and/or varicella-containing vaccines, or any component of the formulation, including gelatin; history of anaphylactic reactions to neomycin; individuals with blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic systems; those receiving immunosuppressive therapy (including high-dose systemic corticosteroids); primary and acquired immunodeficiency states (including AIDs or symptomatic HIV; cellular immune deficiencies; hypogammaglobulinemic and dysgammaglobulinemic states); family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency (until immune competence in the vaccine recipient is demonstrated); active untreated tuberculosis; current febrile illness with fever &gt;38.5°C (&gt;101.3°F); pregnancy</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Priorix-Tetra: Hypersensitivity to this vaccine, measles-, mumps-, rubella-, and/or varicella-containing vaccines, or any component of the formulation, including neomycin; pregnancy; severe humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Note: Immunization during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: </b>Routine vaccination should NOT be delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic (CDC 2020; WHO 2020). In general, simultaneous administration of all vaccines for which a patient is eligible (according to current immunization schedules/guidelines) is recommended (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). However, outpatient visits solely for vaccination should be delayed in persons in quarantine due to close contact with COVID-19 or persons who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection (regardless of symptoms); refer to the CDC's "Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic" for current recommendations (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html).

According to ACIP, doses administered ≤4 days before minimum interval or age are considered valid; however, local or state mandates may supersede this timeframe (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b>Primary immunization:</b> Children 12 months to 12 years: ProQuad: SubQ: 0.5 mL per dose. A complete immunization series for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella requires 2 doses of all components, administered as either the combination product (MMRV-ProQuad) or as separate MMR and varicella vaccines. The first dose is usually administered at 12 to 15 months of age. The second dose is administered at 4 to 6 years of age; second dose may be administered before age 4 if needed, as long as ≥3 months have elapsed since the first dose.</p><p>CDC (ACIP) recommendations: For children receiving their first dose at 12 to 47 months of age, either the MMRV combination vaccine or separate MMR and varicella vaccines can be used; however, the ACIP prefers administration of separate MMR and varicella vaccines as the first dose in this age group unless the parent or caregiver expresses preference for the MMRV combination.

Cases are often associated with preceding or concurrent herpes zoster rash.</p><p>• Febrile seizures: Children 12 to 23 months of age have been reported to have a higher risk of developing febrile seizures with the use of the combination product (MMRV) compared to administration of MMR and varicella separately. Because it is uncommon for a child to have their first febrile seizure after 4 years of age, the ACIP recommends the use of the combination MMRV vaccine for children receiving their first dose at ≥48 months or their second dose at any age. The ACIP recommends that children with a personal or family history of seizures be vaccinated with separate MMR and varicella vaccines, as opposed to the MMRV combination vaccine. For children receiving their first dose at 12 to 47 months of age, either the MMRV combination vaccine or separate MMR and varicella vaccines can be used. The ACIP prefers administration of separate MMR and varicella vaccines as the first dose in this age group unless the parent or caregiver expresses preference for the MMRV combination. Parents and caregivers should be provided with the benefits and risks of both options (CDC/ACIP [Marin 2010]).</p><p>• Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration: Vaccine administration that is too high on the upper arm may cause shoulder injury (eg, shoulder bursitis, tendinopathy) resulting in shoulder pain and reduced range of motion following injection. Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever); vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). Use is contraindicated with fever &gt;38.5°C (&gt;101.3°F).</p><p>• CNS disorders: Use with caution in patients with history of cerebral injury, seizures, or other conditions where stress due to fever should be avoided. Children with a personal or family history of seizures should be vaccinated with separate MMR and varicella vaccines, as opposed to the MMRV combination vaccine (CDC/ACIP [Marin 2010]).</p><p>• HIV: Safety and efficacy of this combination vaccine have not been established in patients with HIV infection. Use is contraindicated in patients with AIDS or symptomatic HIV.</p><p>• Thrombocytopenia: Use with caution in patients with thrombocytopenia and those who develop thrombocytopenia after first dose; thrombocytopenia may worsen.</p><p>• Tuberculosis: Defer vaccination in patients with active untreated tuberculosis. Use is contraindicated in patients with active untreated tuberculosis.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Immune globulins: Recent administration of immune globulins may interfere with immune response. Guidelines with suggested administration intervals are available (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Salicylates: Avoid use of salicylates for 6 weeks following vaccination; varicella may increase the risk of Reye's syndrome.</p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist. The use of combination vaccines is generally preferred over separate injections, taking into consideration provider assessment, patient preference, and potential adverse events. When using combination vaccines, the minimum age for administration is the oldest minimum age for any individual component; the minimum interval between dosing is the greatest minimum interval between any individual components. The ACIP prefers each dose of a specific vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer when possible (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Special populations: </i></b></p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Use is contraindicated in patients with immunosuppression, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy (including high-dose systemic corticosteroids). In general, live vaccines should be administered ≥4 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression and avoided within 2 weeks of immunosuppression when feasible; live vaccines should not be administered for at least 3 months after immunosuppressive therapy (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Albumin: Some products may contain albumin; products containing human albumin may carry a remote risk of viral transmission, including a theoretical risk of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease transmission.</p><p>• Egg allergy: Vaccine contains trace amounts of chick embryo antigen. Use caution in patients with history of immediate hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions following egg ingestion. Generally, the vaccine can be safely administered to persons with an egg allergy (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Gelatin: Some products may contain gelatin. Use is contraindicated in patients with a history of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction to gelatin.</p><p>• Neomycin: Manufactured with neomycin. Use is contraindicated in patients with history of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions to neomycin. Contact dermatitis due to neomycin is not a contraindication to the vaccine.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Antipyretics: Antipyretics have not been shown to prevent febrile seizures; antipyretics may be used to treat fever or discomfort following vaccination (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). One study reported that routine prophylactic administration of acetaminophen prior to vaccination to prevent fever decreased the immune response of some vaccines; the clinical significance of this reduction in immune response has not been established (Prymula 2009).</p><p>• Appropriate use: The safety and efficacy of this combination vaccine has not been established for postexposure prophylaxis.</p><p>• Appropriate use: Use of this vaccine for specific medical and/or other indications (eg, immunocompromising conditions, hepatic or kidney disease, diabetes) is also addressed in the annual ACIP Recommended Immunization Schedules (refer to CDC schedule for detailed information).</p><p>• Blood products: Recent administration of blood or blood products may interfere with immune response. Guidelines with suggested administration intervals are available (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Transmission of virus: Transmission of varicella vaccine virus resulting in varicella infection may occur (rare) between vaccine recipients (with or without varicella-like rash) and contacts susceptible to varicella (including healthy and high-risk individuals). Vaccinated individuals should not have close association with susceptible high-risk individuals for up to 6 weeks following vaccination. High-risk individuals susceptible to the varicella virus include immunocompromised persons, pregnant women without evidence of immunity to varicella, newborns of mothers without evidence of varicella immunity, and infants born &lt;28 weeks' gestation (regardless of maternal immunity).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Rash, fever; monitor for anaphylaxis and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Pregnancy should be avoided for 3 months following vaccination (per manufacturer labeling).</p><p>Refer to the Varicella Virus Vaccine monograph and the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine monograph for additional information.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Use is contraindicated in pregnant females.</p><p>Refer to the Varicella Virus Vaccine monograph and the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine monograph for additional information.</p><h2>More about measles virus vaccine / mumps virus vaccine / rubella virus vaccine / varicella virus vaccine</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
