<html><head></head><body><h1>Diskets Dispersible (Oral)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> methadone (METH-a-done) (Oral route)</p><p>Deaths due to too-rapid titration, drug interactions, or cardiac and respiratory side effects have occurred with methadone use for opioid dependence. Respiratory depression is the main hazard associated with methadone administration. QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmias (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. Only approved hospitals and pharmacies can dispense oral methadone for the treatment of narcotic addiction .</p><p>Warning: Addiction, Abuse And Misuse; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression; Accidental Ingestion; Life-Threatening QT Prolongation; Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome; Interactions With Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes; Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants; And Treatment For Opioid AddictionAddiction, Abuse, and Misuse: Methadone hydrochloride tablets expose patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient’s risk prior to prescribing methadone hydrochloride tablets, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions .Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression: Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of methadone hydrochloride tablets. The peak respiratory depressant effect of methadone occurs later, and persists longer than the peak analgesic effect, especially during the initial dosing period or following a dose increase. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of methadone hydrochloride tablets or following a dose increase. Proper dosing and titration are essential and methadone hydrochloride should only be prescribed by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of methadone for toxification and maintenance treatment of opioid addiction .Accidental Ingestion: Accidental ingestion of even one dose of methadone hydrochloride tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of methadone .Life-Threatening QT Prolongation: QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have occurred during treatment with methadone. Most cases involve patients being treated for pain with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. Closely monitor patients with risk factors for development of prolonged QT interval, a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, and those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction for changes in cardiac rhythm during initiation and titration of methadone hydrochloride tablets Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome: Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of use of methadone hydrochloride tablets during pregnancy. NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. The balance between the risks of NOWS and the benefits of maternal methadone hydrochloride use may differ based on the risks associated with the mother’s underlying condition, pain, or addiction. Advise the patient of the risk of NOWS so that appropriate planning for management of the neonate can occur .Cytochrome P450 InteractionThe concomitant use of methadone hydrochloride tablets with all cytochrome P450 3A4, 2B6, 2C19, 2C9 or 2D6 inhibitors may result in an increase in methadone plasma concentrations, which could cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4, 2B6, 2C19, or 2C9 inducers may also result in an increase in methadone plasma concentration. Follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation, and consider dosage reduction with any changes of concomitant medications that can result in an increase in methadone levels .Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants: Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.Reserve concomitant prescribing of methadone and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate .Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required .Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If the patient is visibly sedated, evaluate the cause of sedation, and consider delaying or omitting the daily methadone dose .Conditions For Distribution And Use Of Methadone Products For The Treatment Of Opioid Addiction:For detoxification and maintenance of opioid dependence, methadone should be administered in accordance with the treatment standards cited in 42 CFR Section 8, including limitations on unsupervised administration .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

This medicine should not be used to treat pain that you only have once in a while or "as needed". Methadone is also used together with medical supervision and counseling to treat opioid addiction (eg, heroin or other morphine-like drugs).</p><p>Methadone is an opioid (narcotic) analgesic (pain medicine). It acts on the nervous system to relieve pain.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Diskets Dispersible</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of methadone in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of methadone in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related heart, kidney, liver, or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving methadone.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
