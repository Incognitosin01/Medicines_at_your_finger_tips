Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5)</span>].</p><p>After observing the response to initial therapy with Qmiiz ODT, adjust the dose to suit an individual patient's needs.</p><p>In adults, the maximum recommended daily oral dose of Qmiiz ODT is 15 mg regardless of formulation. In patients with hemodialysis, a maximum daily dosage of 7.5 mg is recommended [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p>With Qmiiz ODT, administration with liquid is not necessary. Qmiiz ODT may be taken without regard to timing of meals.</p><p>Qmiiz ODT should be taken as follows:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Leave Qmiiz ODT in the original package until the time of administration.</li>
<li>Be sure that hands are dry when handling an orally disintegrating tablet.</li>
<li>Open the carton and peel back the foil on the blister. Do not push the tablet through the foil as this could damage the tablet.</li>
<li>Gently remove the tablet from the blister and place it in the mouth, or onto the tongue, immediately after removing from the blister.</li>
<li>The tablet will disintegrate quickly in saliva and can be easily swallowed with or without drinking liquid.</li>
</ul><h3>Osteoarthritis</h3><p class="First">For the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, the recommended starting and maintenance oral dose of Qmiiz ODT is 7.5 mg once daily. Some patients may receive additional benefit by increasing the dose to 15 mg once daily.</p><h3>Rheumatoid Arthritis</h3><p class="First">For the relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended starting and maintenance oral dose of Qmiiz ODT is 7.5 mg once daily. Some patients may receive additional benefit by increasing the dose to 15 mg once daily.</p><h3>Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA) Pauciarticular and Polyarticular Course</h3><p class="First">For the treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended oral dose of Qmiiz ODT is 7.5 mg once daily in children who weigh greater than or equal to 60 kg. There was no additional benefit demonstrated by increasing the dose above 7.5 mg in clinical trials.</p><p>Only use Qmiiz ODT tablets in children who weigh greater than or equal to 60 kg.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The use of Qmiiz ODT in subjects with severe renal impairment is not recommended.</p><p>In patients on hemodialysis, the maximum dosage of Qmiiz ODT is 7.5 mg per day [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Non-Interchangeability with Other Formulations of Meloxicam</h3><p class="First">Qmiiz ODT (meloxicam) orally disintegrating tablets have not shown equivalent systemic exposure with a comparable pharmacokinetic profile to other approved formulations of oral meloxicam. Therefore, Qmiiz ODT tablets are not interchangeable with other formulations of oral meloxicam product even if the total milligram strength is the same. Do not substitute similar dose strengths of Qmiiz ODT with other formulations of oral meloxicam products.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Qmiiz ODT (meloxicam) orally disintegrating tablet is a freeze-dried orally administered formulation containing 7.5 mg or 15 mg meloxicam and is designed to rapidly disintegrate in the mouth. Both strengths are orange-flavored, yellow, circular tablets and are debossed with an identifying marking: either 7.5 or 15 (see images below).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Qmiiz ODT is contraindicated in the following patients:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions) to meloxicam or any components of the drug product [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.9)</span>]</li>
<li>History of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, sometimes fatal, anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8)</span>]</li>
<li>In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Patients with phenylketonuria</span> [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p><p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as meloxicam, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Status Post-Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</span></p><p>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Post-MI Patients</span></p><p>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</p><p>Avoid the use of Qmiiz ODT in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If Qmiiz ODT is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</span></p><p>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients</span>:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.</li>
<li>Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.</li>
<li>Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.</li>
<li>Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.</li>
<li>If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue Qmiiz ODT until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.</li>
<li>In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</li>
</ul><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.</p><p>Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including meloxicam.</p><p>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue Qmiiz ODT immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including Qmiiz ODT, can lead to new onset or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><h3>Heart Failure and Edema</h3><p class="First">The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</p><p>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of meloxicam may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>Avoid the use of Qmiiz ODT in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If Qmiiz ODT is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Toxicity</span></p><p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs, including Qmiiz ODT, has resulted in renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, and other renal injury.</p><p>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>The renal effects of Qmiiz ODT may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. Because some Qmiiz ODT metabolites are excreted by the kidney, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</p><p>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating Qmiiz ODT. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of Qmiiz ODT [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of Qmiiz ODT in patients with advanced renal disease. Avoid the use of Qmiiz ODT in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If Qmiiz ODT is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Meloxicam has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to meloxicam and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>].</p><p>Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin- sensitive patients, Qmiiz ODT is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>]. When Qmiiz ODT is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of Qmiiz ODT at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Qmiiz ODT is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><h3>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">Meloxicam may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including Qmiiz ODT, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>].</p><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with Qmiiz ODT has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.</p><p>NSAIDs, including Qmiiz ODT, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><h3>Patients with Phenylketonuria</h3><p class="First">Qmiiz ODT contains phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). The 7.5 mg and 15 mg orally disintegrating tablets contain 0.30 mg and 0.59 mg of phenylalanine, respectively. Qmiiz ODT is contraindicated in patients with phenylketonuria [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><h3>Masking of Inflammation and Fever</h3><p class="First">The pharmacological activity of Qmiiz ODT in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><h3>Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)</span>].</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

Meloxicam at these doses was administered to 661 patients for at least 6 months and to 312 patients for at least one year. Approximately 10,500 of these patients were treated in ten placebo- and/or active-controlled osteoarthritis trials and 2363 of these patients were treated in ten placebo- and/or active-controlled rheumatoid arthritis trials.

These studies consisted of two 12-week multicenter, double-blind, randomized trials (one with a 12-week open-label extension and one with a 40-week extension) and one 1-year open-label PK study. The adverse events observed in these pediatric studies with meloxicam were similar in nature to the adult clinical trial experience, although there were differences in frequency. In particular, the following most common adverse events, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and pyrexia, were more common in the pediatric than in the adult trials. Rash was reported in seven (&lt;2%) patients receiving meloxicam. No unexpected adverse events were identified during the course of the trials. The adverse events did not demonstrate an age or gender-specific subgroup effect.</p><p>The following is a list of adverse drug reactions occurring in &lt;2% of patients receiving meloxicam in clinical trials involving approximately 16,200 patients.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of meloxicam. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions about whether to include an adverse event from spontaneous reports in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the event, (2) number of reports, or (3) strength of causal relationship to the drug.</p><p>Adverse reactions reported in worldwide post marketing experience or the literature include: acute urinary retention; agranulocytosis; alterations in mood (such as mood elevation); anaphylactoid reactions including shock; erythema multiforme; exfoliative dermatitis; interstitial nephritis; jaundice; liver failure; Stevens-Johnson syndrome; toxic epidermal necrolysis, and infertility female.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">See Table 5 for clinically significant drug interactions with meloxicam [<span class="Italics">see</span> Warnings <span class="Italics">and Precautions (5.2, 5.6, 5.11) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Meloxicam and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of meloxicam and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.</li>
<li>Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.</li>

Avoid use of NSAIDs including Qmiiz ODT, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of pregnancy (third trimester) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].</span> There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Qmiiz ODT in pregnant women. Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, embryofetal death was observed in rats and rabbits treated during the period of organogenesis with meloxicam at oral doses equivalent to 0.65- and 6.5- times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of Qmiiz ODT. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats and rabbits treated with meloxicam during organogenesis at an oral dose equivalent to 2.6- and 26-times the MRHD. An increased incidence of septal heart defects were observed in rabbits treated throughout embryogenesis with meloxicam at an oral dose equivalent to 78-times the MRHD. In pre- and post-natal reproduction studies, there was an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased offspring survival at 0.08-times the MRHD of meloxicam [see Data].</p><p>Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, such as meloxicam, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2-4% for major malformations, and 15-20% for pregnancy loss.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Premature Closure of the Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Avoid use of NSAID's in pregnant women after 30 weeks gestation because NSAIDs, including Qmiiz ODT, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Meloxicam was not teratogenic when administered to pregnant rats during fetal organogenesis at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (2.6-fold greater than the MRHD of 15 mg of Qmiiz ODT based on BSA comparison). Administration of meloxicam to pregnant rabbits throughout embryogenesis produced an increased incidence of septal defects of the heart at an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (78-fold greater than the MRHD based on BSA comparison). The no effect level in this study was 20 mg/kg/day (26-fold greater than the MRHD based on BSA conversion). In rats and rabbits, embryo-lethality occurred at oral meloxicam doses of 1 mg/kg/day and 5 mg/kg/day, respectively (0.65- and 6.5-fold greater, respectively, than the MRHD based on BSA comparison) when administered throughout organogenesis.</p><p>Oral administration of meloxicam to pregnant rats during late gestation through lactation increased the incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased offspring survival at meloxicam doses of 0.125 mg/kg/day or greater (0.08-times MRHD based on BSA comparison).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no human data available on whether meloxicam is present in human milk, or on the effects on breastfed infants, or on milk production. Meloxicam is present in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations higher than those in plasma. The concentration of the drug in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. However, when a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Qmiiz ODT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Qmiiz ODT or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Females</span></p><p>Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including Qmiiz ODT, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including Qmiiz ODT, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Males</span></p><p>Qmiiz ODT may compromise fertility in males of reproductive potential. In a published study, oral administration of meloxicam to male rats for 35 days resulted in decreased sperm count and motility and histopathological evidence of testicular degeneration at 0.6-times the MRHD based on BSA comparison <span class="Italics">[See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span> It is not known if these effects on fertility are reversible.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of meloxicam in pediatric JRA patients from 2 to 17 years of age has been evaluated in three clinical trials [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)</span>].</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.13)</span>].</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been adequately studied. Since meloxicam is significantly metabolized in the liver and hepatotoxicity may occur, use meloxicam with caution in patients with hepatic impairment [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment have not been studied. The use of Qmiiz ODT in subjects with severe renal impairment is not recommended. In patients on hemodialysis, meloxicam should not exceed 7.5 mg per day. Meloxicam is not dialyzable [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates</h3><p class="First">In patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin or phenytoin), consider dose reduction, as these patients may have abnormally high plasma levels of meloxicam due to reduced metabolic clearance. Monitor these patients for adverse effects.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6)</span>].</p><p>Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</p><p>There is limited experience with meloxicam overdosage. Cholestyramine is known to accelerate the clearance of meloxicam. Accelerated removal of meloxicam by 4 g oral doses of cholestyramine given three times a day was demonstrated in a clinical trial. Administration of cholestyramine may be useful following an overdosage.</p><p>For additional information about overdosage treatment, call a poison control center (1-800-222-1222).</p><h2>Qmiiz ODT Description</h2><p class="First">Qmiiz ODT (meloxicam) orally disintegrating tablet is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug available as orally disintegrating tablets containing 7.5 mg or 15 mg meloxicam and is designed to rapidly disintegrate in the mouth upon oral administration. Both strengths are orange-flavored, yellow, circular tablets and debossed with either 7.5 or 15.</p><p>Meloxicam is chemically designated as 4-hydroxy-2-methyl-N-(5-methyl-2-thiazolyl)-2H-1,2-benzothiazine-3-carboxamide-1,1-dioxide. The molecular weight is 351.4. Its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">13</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>S<span class="Sub">2</span> and it has the following structural formula:</p><p></p><p>The inactive ingredients in Qmiiz ODT tablet include gelatin, mannitol, citric acid, aspartame, and orange flavoring agent.</p><p>Qmiiz ODT is packaged in aluminum blister packs composed of a multi-layered (5 layers) laminated blister film and a lidding foil. The lidding foil is designed to be peeled open to allow the removal of the lidding foil over each tablet and removal of the tablet. The tablet begins disintegrating in the mouth within seconds, allowing its contents to be subsequently swallowed with or without liquid or chewing.</p><h2>Qmiiz ODT - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Meloxicam has analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of Qmiiz ODT, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</p><p>Meloxicam is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Meloxicam concentrations reached during therapy have produced <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because meloxicam is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>The absolute bioavailability of meloxicam tablets was 89% following a single oral dose of 30 mg compared with 30 mg IV bolus injection. Following single intravenous doses, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were shown in the range of 5 mg to 60 mg. After multiple oral doses, the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam tablets were dose-proportional over the range of 7.5 mg to 15 mg. Mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> was achieved within four to five hours after a 7.5 mg meloxicam tablet was taken under fasted conditions, indicating a prolonged drug absorption. With multiple dosing, steady-state concentrations were reached by Day 5. A second meloxicam concentration peak occurs around 12 to 14 hours post-dose suggesting biliary recycling.</p><p>Qmiiz ODT has been shown to meet bioequivalence criteria for both C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC as compared to MOBIC tablets.</p><p>Table 6 shows single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for meloxicam 7.5 and 15 mg tablets.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">1</span></span> The parameter values in the table are from various studies</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">2</span></span> Not under high-fat conditions</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">3</span></span> Meloxicam tablets</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">4</span></span> Vz/F <span class="Bold">=</span>Dose/(AUC•K<span class="Sub">el</span>)</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Food and Antacid Effects</span></p><p>Administration of meloxicam tablets following a high fat breakfast (75 g of fat) resulted in mean peak drug levels (i.e., C<span class="Sub">max</span>) being increased by approximately 22% while the extent of absorption (AUC) was unchanged. The time to maximum concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) was achieved between 5 and 6 hours. In comparison, neither the AUC nor the C<span class="Sub">max</span> values for meloxicam suspension were affected following a similar high fat meal, while mean T<span class="Sub">max</span> values were increased to approximately 7 hours. No pharmacokinetic interaction was detected with concomitant administration of antacids.</p><p>Administration of Qmiiz ODT with a high-fat breakfast (150 calories from protein, 250 calories from carbohydrates, and 500 calories from fat) did not affect the C<span class="Sub">max</span> or AUC of meloxicam, while the median T<span class="Sub">max</span> was increased from 4 to 12 hours. Qmiiz ODT can be administered without regard to timing of meals or concomitant administration of antacids.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The mean volume of distribution (V<span class="Sub">ss</span>) of meloxicam is approximately 10 L. Meloxicam is ~99.4% bound to human plasma proteins (primarily albumin) within the therapeutic dose range. The fraction of protein binding is independent of drug concentration, over the clinically relevant concentration range, but decreases to ~99% in patients with renal disease. Meloxicam penetration into human red blood cells, after oral dosing, is less than 10%. Following a radiolabeled dose, over 90% of the radioactivity detected in the plasma was present as unchanged meloxicam.</p><p>Meloxicam concentrations in synovial fluid, after a single oral dose, range from 40% to 50% of those in plasma. The free fraction in synovial fluid is 2.5 times higher than in plasma, due to the lower albumin content in synovial fluid as compared to plasma. The significance of this penetration is unknown.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Meloxicam is extensively metabolized in the liver. Meloxicam metabolites include 5'-carboxy meloxicam (60% of dose), from P-450 mediated metabolism formed by oxidation of an intermediate metabolite 5'-hydroxymethyl meloxicam which is also excreted to a lesser extent (9% of dose). <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicate that CYP2C9 (cytochrome P450 metabolizing enzyme) plays an important role in this metabolic pathway with a minor contribution of the CYP3A4 isozyme. Patients' peroxidase activity is probably responsible for the other two metabolites which account for 16% and 4% of the administered dose, respectively. All the four metabolites are not known to have any <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> pharmacological activity.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Meloxicam excretion is predominantly in the form of metabolites, and occurs to equal extents in the urine and feces. Only traces of the unchanged parent compound are excreted in the urine (0.2%) and feces (1.6%). The extent of the urinary excretion was confirmed for unlabeled multiple 7.5 mg doses: 0.5%, 6%, and 13% of the dose were found in urine in the form of meloxicam, and the 5'-hydroxymethyl and 5'-carboxy metabolites, respectively. There is significant biliary and/or enteral secretion of the drug. This was demonstrated when oral administration of cholestyramine following a single IV dose of meloxicam decreased the AUC of meloxicam by 50%.</p><p>The mean elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) ranges from 15 hours to 20 hours. The elimination half-life is constant across dose levels indicating linear metabolism within the therapeutic dose range. Plasma clearance ranges from 7 to 9 mL/min.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatric</span></p><p>After single (0.25 mg/kg) dose administration and after achieving steady state (0.375 mg/kg/day), there was a general trend of approximately 30% lower exposure in younger patients (2 to 6 years old) as compared to the older patients (7 to 16 years old). The older patients had meloxicam exposures similar (single dose) or slightly reduced (steady state) to those in the adult patients, when using AUC values normalized to a dose of 0.25 mg/kg [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span>]. The meloxicam mean (SD) elimination half-life was 15.2 (10.1) and 13.0 hours (3.0) for the 2- to 6-year-old patients, and 7- to 16-year-old patients, respectively.</p><p>In a covariate analysis, utilizing population pharmacokinetics body-weight, but not age, was the single predictive covariate for differences in the meloxicam apparent oral plasma clearance. The body-weight normalized apparent oral clearance values were adequate predictors of meloxicam exposure in pediatric patients.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of Qmiiz ODT in pediatric patients under 2 years of age have not been investigated.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Geriatric</span></p><p>Elderly males (≥65 years of age) exhibited meloxicam plasma concentrations and steady-state pharmacokinetics similar to young males. Elderly females (≥65 years of age) had a 47% higher AUC<span class="Sub">ss</span> and 32% higher C<span class="Sub">max ss</span> as compared to younger females (≤55 years of age) after body weight normalization. Despite the increased total concentrations in the elderly females, the adverse event profile was comparable for both elderly patient populations. A smaller free fraction was found in elderly female patients in comparison to elderly male patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Sex</span></p><p>Young females exhibited slightly lower plasma concentrations relative to young males. After single doses of 7.5 mg meloxicam, the mean elimination half-life was 19.5 hours for the female group as compared to 23.4 hours for the male group. At steady state, the data were similar (17.9 hours vs 21.4 hours). This pharmacokinetic difference due to gender is likely to be of little clinical importance. There was linearity of pharmacokinetics and no appreciable difference in the C<span class="Sub">max</span> or T<span class="Sub">max</span> across genders.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Following a single 15 mg dose of meloxicam there was no marked difference in plasma concentrations in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class I) or moderate (Child- Pugh Class II) hepatic impairment compared to healthy volunteers. Protein binding of meloxicam was not affected by hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class III) have not been adequately studied [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Meloxicam pharmacokinetics have been investigated in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment. Total drug plasma concentrations of meloxicam decreased and total clearance of meloxicam increased with the degree of renal impairment while free AUC values were similar in all groups. The higher meloxicam clearance in subjects with renal impairment may be due to increased fraction of unbound meloxicam which is available for hepatic metabolism and subsequent excretion. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment have not been adequately studied. The use of Qmiiz ODT in subjects with severe renal impairment is not recommended [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Hemodialysis</span></p><p>Following a single dose of meloxicam, the free C<span class="Sub">max</span> plasma concentrations were higher in patients with renal failure on chronic hemodialysis (1% free fraction) in comparison to healthy volunteers (0.3% free fraction).

When meloxicam is administered with aspirin (1000 mg three times daily) to healthy volunteers, it tended to increase the AUC (10%) and C<span class="Sub">max</span> (24%) of meloxicam. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 5 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Cholestyramine:</span> Pretreatment for four days with cholestyramine significantly increased the clearance of meloxicam by 50%. This resulted in a decrease in t<span class="Sub">1/2,</span> from 19.2 hours to 12.5 hours, and a 35% reduction in AUC.

In these subjects, meloxicam did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics and the average anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time. However, one subject showed an increase in INR from 1.5 to 2.1. Caution should be used when administering Qmiiz ODT with warfarin since patients on warfarin may experience changes in INR and an increased risk of bleeding complications when a new medication is introduced [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><h3>Pharmacogenomics</h3><p class="First">CYP2C9 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic variants such as CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 polymorphisms.
