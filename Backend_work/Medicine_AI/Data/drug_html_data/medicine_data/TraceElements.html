Must be diluted prior to use and infused as component of parenteral nutrition or parenteral solutions. Do not administer undiluted solutions by direct injection into a peripheral vein.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• GI malfunction: Consider reduction in dosage or deletion of selenium in patients with GI malfunction.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Copper and manganese may accumulate in severe hepatic impairment and/or biliary obstruction; consider reduction in dosage or deletion of copper and manganese in patients with severe hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; metals may accumulate in renal failure. Consider reduction in dosage or deletion of selenium in patients with renal impairment.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol with caution in neonates. See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><p><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></p><p>• Aluminum toxicity: Contains aluminum; toxic aluminum concentrations may be seen with high doses, prolonged use, or in patients with renal impairment. Premature neonates are at higher risk due to immature renal function and aluminum intake from other parenteral sources. Parenteral aluminum exposure of &gt;4 to 5 mcg/kg/day is associated with CNS and bone toxicity; tissue loading may occur at lower doses.</p><p>• Manganese toxicity: Basal ganglia accumulation (detected on MRI) and clinical symptoms (eg, neuropsychiatric, seizures, parkinsonian-like tremor, dysarthria, mask-face, halting gate, dystonic movements) of manganese toxicity have been reported in adult and pediatric patients, including patients receiving manganese at or below recommended doses and with normal blood manganese levels. Risk may be increased in patients receiving higher than recommended doses and with cholestatic liver disease. Symptoms and MRI findings generally improve over weeks to months following discontinuation of manganese but may not completely resolve. Monitor manganese blood levels and for neurologic toxicity in patients receiving manganese long-term as a component of parenteral nutrition therapy. If manganese toxicity is suspected, temporarily discontinue and further evaluate.</p><p>• Overdose potential: Multiple trace metal solutions present a risk of overdosage when the need for one trace element is appreciably higher than for others in the formulation; utilization of individual trace metal solutions may be needed.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Periodically monitor plasma zinc, copper, manganese, chromium and selenium, with more frequent monitoring in patients receiving more than the usual dose or long-term therapy.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Refer to individual elements for requirements in pregnancy.</p><h2>More about trace elements</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
