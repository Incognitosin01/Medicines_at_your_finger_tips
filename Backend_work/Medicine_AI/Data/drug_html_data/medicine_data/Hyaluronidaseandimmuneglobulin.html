Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of using this medication.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is hyaluronidase and immune globulin given?</h2><p>Hyaluronidase and immune globulin is usually given once every 4 weeks. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results. Do not take  hyaluronidase and immune globulin in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Hyaluronidase and immune globulin is injected under the skin using an infusion pump.

Do not give yourself an injection if you do not understand these instructions. Call your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist for help.</p><p>If you use this medicine at home, keep a diary of the days and times you gave the injection and where you injected it on your body.</p><p>Hyaluronidase and immune globulin comes in a kit that contains a "dual vial" unit. The small vial contains hyaluronidase and the large vial contains immune globulin. <b>Do not mix these two medicines together. They should be given one after the other.</b> You will inject hyaluronidase first, and then inject immune globulin within 10 minutes. Do not mix any other medicines in the same infusion.</p><p>The hyaluronidase and immune globulin kit comes with patient instructions for preparing and injecting your dose. Follow these directions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>Do not shake the vials or you may ruin the medicine. Prepare your dose only when you are ready to give an injection. The medicines should look clear and have no color, but the immune globulin may appear a pale yellow. Do not use if either medicine looks cloudy or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p>Each single-use vial (bottle) of hyaluronidase or immune globulin is for one use only. Throw away after one use, even if there is still some medicine left in it after injecting your dose.</p><p>Use disposable injection items (syringe, needle, catheter, tubing) only once. Follow any state or local laws about throwing away used needles and syringes. Use a puncture-proof "sharps" disposal container (ask your pharmacist where to get one and how to throw it away). Keep this container out of the reach of children and pets.</p><p>While using hyaluronidase and immune globulin, you may need frequent blood tests.</p><p>This medicine can cause unusual results with certain medical tests.

Do not freeze and protect from light.</p><p>Take a vial out of the refrigerator up to 60 minutes before preparing your dose, to allow the medicine to reach room temperature. Once a vial has reached room temperature, do not return it to the refrigerator.</p><p>You may also store the medicine at room temperature for up to 3 months, away from moisture, heat, and light. Throw away any hyaluronidase and immune globulin not used before the expiration date on the medicine label.</p><p>Do not heat the medicine before using.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss a dose of this medicine.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using hyaluronidase and immune globulin?</h2><p><b>Do not inject  hyaluronidase and immune globulin into any skin that is red or swollen.</b> Injecting hyaluronidase and immune globulin into infected skin could cause the infection to spread to other parts of your body.</p><p>Do not receive a "live" vaccine while using hyaluronidase and immune globulin.
