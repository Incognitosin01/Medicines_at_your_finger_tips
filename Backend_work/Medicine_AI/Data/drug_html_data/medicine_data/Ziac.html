Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill) that helps prevent your body from absorbing too much salt, which can cause fluid retention.</p><p>Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker. Beta-blockers affect the heart and circulation (blood flow through arteries and veins).</p><p>Ziac is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).</p><p>Ziac may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Ziac if you are unable to urinate. <b>You should not use this medicine if you have a serious heart condition</b> such as "sick sinus syndrome" or "AV block," severe heart failure, or slow heartbeats that have caused you to faint.</p><p>Before using Ziac, tell your doctor if you have congestive heart failure, circulation problems, kidney or liver disease, cirrhosis, glaucoma, asthma, bronchospastic lung disease, a thyroid disorder, lupus, gout, diabetes, or a penicillin allergy.</p><p>If you are diabetic, check your blood sugar carefully. Using bisoprolol can make it harder for you to tell when you have low blood sugar. Your insulin or diabetic medication needs may change while you are taking Ziac. Talk with your doctor before changing any doses.</p><p>Avoid becoming overheated or dehydrated during exercise and in hot weather. Follow your doctor's instructions about the type and amount of liquids you should drink. In some cases, drinking too much liquid can be as unsafe as not drinking enough.</p><p>Keep using Ziac even if you feel fine. High blood pressure often has no symptoms.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Ziac if you are allergic to hydrochlorothiazide or bisoprolol, or if you have:</p><ul>

Follow all directions on your prescription label. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results. Do not use Ziac in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>You may have very low blood pressure while taking Ziac. Call your doctor if you are sick with vomiting or diarrhea, or if you are sweating more than usual. Prolonged illness can lead to a serious electrolyte imbalance, making it dangerous for you to use Ziac.</p><p>Your blood pressure will need to be checked often. Your blood and urine may both be tested if you have been vomiting or are dehydrated.</p><p>If you are diabetic, check your blood sugar carefully. Taking bisoprolol may make it harder for you to tell when you have low blood sugar. Your insulin or diabetes medication needs may change while you are taking Ziac. Do not change your medication dose or schedule without your doctor's advice.</p><p>If you need surgery or medical tests, tell the doctor ahead of time that you are taking medication that contains hydrochlorothiazide. You may need to stop using the medicine for a short time.</p><p><b>Do not skip doses or stop using Ziac suddenly.</b> Stopping suddenly may make your condition worse. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.</p><p>Keep using Ziac as directed, even if you feel well. High blood pressure often has no symptoms. You may need to use blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life.</p><p>Store at room temperature, away from heat and moisture. Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Hypertension:</b></p><p>Initial dose: Bisoprolol 2.5 mg-Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg orally once a day<br/>
