Edurant is for use in adults and children at least 12 years old who weigh at least 77 pounds (35 kilograms) and have never before taken an HIV medicine. <b>Edurant is not a cure for HIV or AIDS.</b></p><p>Edurant is sometimes used with a medicine called cabotegravir as a daily "lead-in dose" to help determine that you can safely use a combination form of these medicines given as a monthly injection. Edurant and cabotegravir may also be given short-term in place of the monthly injectable combination for up to 2 months. When used with cabotegravir for these purposes, Edurant is only for adults with HIV who have already used other antiviral medicines that have controlled their viral load.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before you take Edurant, tell your doctor if you have liver disease (including hepatitis B or C), kidney disease, a history of depression or mental illness, or if you have ever taken any HIV medication in the past.</p><p>Some medicines can interact with rilpivirine and should not be used at the same time.
