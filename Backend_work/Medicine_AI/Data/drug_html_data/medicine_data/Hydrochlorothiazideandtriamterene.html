Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene is usually taken once per day.</p><p>You may need frequent medical tests. Even if you have no symptoms, tests can help your doctor determine if this medicine is effective.</p><p>Your heart function may also need to be checked using an electrocardiograph or ECG (sometimes called an EKG).</p><p>Severe illness can affect your potassium levels. Call your doctor if you have a serious illness, injury, or medical emergency.</p><p>If you need surgery or medical tests, tell the doctor you currently use this medicine. You may need to stop for a short time.</p><p>If you have high blood pressure, keep using this medicine even if you feel well. High blood pressure often has no symptoms. You may need to use blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose.

Too much salt will cause your body to retain water and can make  hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene less effective.</p><p>Hydrochlorothiazide may increase your risk of skin cancer. Avoid sunlight or tanning beds. Wear protective clothing and use sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) when you are outdoors. Your doctor may want you to have skin examinations on a regular basis.</p><p>Avoid becoming overheated or dehydrated during exercise, in hot weather, or by not drinking enough fluids.
