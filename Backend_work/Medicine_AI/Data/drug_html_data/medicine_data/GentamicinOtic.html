Gentamicin otic preparations are used to treat infections of the ear canal.</p><p>Gentamicin is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using gentamicin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For gentamicin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to gentamicin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>There is no specific information comparing use of gentamicin otic solution in children up to 6 years of age with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of gentamicin in the elderly with use in other age groups, gentamicin is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of gentamicin. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Any other ear infection or problem (including punctured or absent eardrum)—Use of gentamicin otic preparations in persons with this condition may lead to systemic absorption, and increase the chance of side effects.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of gentamicin</h2><p>To use:</p><ul>
<li>Lie down or tilt the head so that the infected ear faces up. Gently pull the earlobe up and back for adults (down and back for children) to straighten the ear canal. Drop the medicine into the ear canal. Keep the ear facing up for about 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to come into contact with the infection. A sterile cotton plug may be gently inserted into the ear opening to prevent the medicine from leaking out.</li>
<li>To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the ear). Also, keep the container tightly closed.</li>
</ul><p>To help clear up your infection completely, keep using gentamicin for the full time of treatment, even if your symptoms have disappeared. Do not miss any doses.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of gentamicin will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of gentamicin. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
