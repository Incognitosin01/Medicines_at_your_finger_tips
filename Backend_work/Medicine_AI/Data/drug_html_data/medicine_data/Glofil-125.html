Glofil-125 (Sodium Iothalamate I-125 Injection) is a sterile, nonpyrogenic aqueous injection containing approximately 1 mg sodium iothalamate per mL, and 0.9 percent benzyl alcohol as a preservative. The radioactive concentration of the material is 250-300 µCi/mL as of the calibration date. Sodium bicarbonate and hydrochloric acid are present for pH adjustment.</p><h2>Physical Characteristics</h2><p class="First">Iodine-125 decays by electron capture with a physical half-life of 60.14 days.</p><p>Photons that are useful for detection are listed in Table 1.</p><p></p><p>The specific gamma ray constant for I-125 is 1.43 R/mCi-hr at 1 cm. The first half value thickness of lead (Pb) for I-125 is 0.017 mm. A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide resulting from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 2. For example, the use of 0.28 mm of Pb will decrease the external radiation exposure by a factor of 10,000.</p><p></p><p>To correct for physical decay of this radionuclide, the fractions that remain at selected time intervals after the date of calibration are shown in Table 3.</p><p></p><h2>Glofil-125 - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The renal clearance of sodium iothalamate in man closely approximates that of inulin. The compound is cleared by glomerular filtration without tubular secretion or reabsorption. Following infusion administration of I-125 iothalamate, the effective half-life is about 0.07 days.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Glofil-125</h2><p class="First">Glofil-125 (Sodium Iothalamate I-125 Injection) is indicated for evaluation of glomerular filtration in the diagnosis or monitoring of patients with renal disease.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Glofil-125 should not be administered via a central venous line.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">None known</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p><p>As in the use of any radioactive material, care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure to the patient, consistent with proper patient management, and to insure minimum radiation exposure to occupational workers. Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides. Rapid or bolus-like injections should be avoided.</p><p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>No long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential, or whether this drug affects fertility in males or females.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C</span></p><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Glofil-125. It is also not known whether Glofil-125 can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Glofil-125 should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span></p><p>Radioiodine is excreted in human milk during lactation. It is not known whether Glofil-125 is excreted in human milk. Therefore, formula feedings should be substituted for breast feedings.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span></p><p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">None Reported</p><h2>Dosage</h2><p class="First">The suggested dose range employed in the average patient (70 kg) is as follows:</p><p>Continuous intravenous infusion: 20 to 100 μCi (0.74-3.7 megabecquerels) (Sigman, et al (1) method).</p><p>Single intravenous injection: 10 to 30 µCi (0.37-1.11 megabecquerels) Cohen, et al (2) method)</p><p>The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Technique</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Continuous intravenous infusion</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Sigman<span class="Sup">1</span> method</span></p><p><span class="Bold">I. <span class="Bold">Preparation:</span></span></p><p>2. It is not necessary to withhold breakfast or admit the patient the night before.</p><p><span class="Bold">II. <span class="Bold">Procedure:</span></span></p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">III. <span class="Bold">Clearance Calculations:</span></span></p><p>1. Aliquots (1 mL each) of plasma and urine from each collection period are counted in a standard gamma-ray scintillation well detector.</p><p>2. All counts are corrected for background activity.</p><p>3. Glomerular filtration rate is calculated by the formula C=UV/P, in which:</p><p>                   C = glomerular filtration rate in mL/min<br/>
                   U= urinary concentration of radioactivity in net counts/min/mL<br/>
                   V= urinary flow rate in mL/min<br/>
                   P = plasma concentration of radioactivity in net counts/min/mL</p><p><br/>
4. Average glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is calculated from the rates for the individual collection periods. GFR can be expressed in terms of body</p><p>    weight (mL/min/kg) or body surface area (mL/min/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><p>5. Unilateral glomerular filtration rates can be determined by the same technique by utilizing ureteral catheterization.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Single intravenous injection</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Cohen<span class="Sup">2</span> method:</span></p><p>The method of Cohen, et al<span class="Sup">2</span> requires little preparation, few and small blood samples, no bladder catheterization, and no constant intravenous infusion. It is simple to perform, rapid, and utilizes equipment which is readily available in most modern laboratories.</p><p><span class="Bold">I. <span class="Bold">Preparation:</span></span></p><p>1. Lugol's solution, 3 drops orally, three times a day, is administered for one or two days prior to the test.</p><p>   No diet or water restriction is necessary.</p><p>2. Oral water load is begun one hour before starting the test. Start with 20 mL/kg and force any clear liquids (unless contraindicated) until the test is complete.</p><p><span class="Bold">II. <span class="Bold">Procedure:</span></span> Record actual times for the collection of the blood and urine samples.</p><p>1. Empty the bladder and label the urine Urine control.</p><p>2. Inject 10-30 µCi Glofil-125 intravenously; wait 30 to 60 minutes.</p><p>3. Collect the entire urine and label Urine discard.</p><p>4. Draw 4 to 5 mL of blood into a heparinized syringe. Label Plasma #1.</p><p>5. After another 30 to 60 minutes, collect the entire urine and label Urine #1.</p><p>6. Immediately draw another blood specimen. Label Plasma #2.</p><p>7. After final 30 to 60 minute wait, collect the urine. Label Urine #2.</p><p>8. Draw the last blood specimen immediately. Label Plasma #3.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">III. <span class="Bold">Clearance Calculations:</span></span></p><p>1. Radioactivity of one mL aliquots of both urine and plasma are determined using a well-scintillation detector with a single channel pulse-height analyzer. Sufficiently reproducible counts are usually obtained with time settings of 2 minutes for urine samples and 20 minutes for the plasma samples. Calculations of the clearance rates are made by using the formula:(1)</p><p>C = C = UV/P + 1.73/SA where</p><p>C = glomerular filtration rate in mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p>U = urine radioactivity in counts/min/mL</p><p>V = urine flow rate in mL/min</p><p>P= mean plasma radioactivity in counts/min/mL</p><p>SA= body surface area in m<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Radiation Dosimetry</span><br/>
The estimated absorbed radiation doses to an average (70 kg) patient from an intravenous dose of 100 µCi (3.7 megabecquerels) of Glofil-125 are shown in Table 4. Calculations assume that there is 1% free iodide in the preparation and that the thyroid uptake of the iodine is 25%.</p><p></p><h2>Visual Inspection</h2><p class="First">Parental drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to admnistration, whenever solution and container permit.</p><h2>How is Glofil-125 Supplied</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Identity</span></p><p>No. 1000, Glofil-125 is a clear, colorless, sterile, and nonpyrogenic solution available as a 4 mL vial. It is supplied in a concentration of approximately 1 mg/mL sodium iothalamate (range is 0.5–2.0 mg sodium iothalamate per mL), with a radioactivity concentration of 250 to 300 μCi/mL at the time of calibration.
