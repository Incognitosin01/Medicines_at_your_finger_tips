</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs are contraindicated in women who are over 35 years of age and smoke <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Iclevia</h2><p class="First">Iclevia<span class="Sup">TM</span> (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets) is indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy.</p><h2>Iclevia Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>How to Start Iclevia</h3><p class="First">Iclevia is dispensed in an Extended-Cycle Wallet <span class="Italics">[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]. </span> Iclevia should be started on a Sunday (see Table 1). For the first cycle of a Sunday Start regimen, an additional method of contraception should be used until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration.<br/>
<br/>
Instruct patients to take Iclevia once a day by mouth at the same time every day for 91 days. To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Iclevia should be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours. For patient instructions regarding missed pills, see <span class="Italics">FDA-approved patient labeling</span>.</p><h3>How to Take Iclevia</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Iclevia active tablets are white (Day 1 to Day 84). </li>
<li>Iclevia inactive tablets are green (Day 85 to Day 91).</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>Take the first <span class="Bold">white</span> tablet (0.15 mg of levonorgestrel and 0.03 mg  ethinyl estradiol) on the first Sunday after the onset of menstruation. If menstruation begins on a Sunday, take the tablet on that day. <span class="Bold">Due to the potential risk of becoming pregnant, use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms or spermicide) for the first 7 days of treatment.</span> </li>
<li>Take subsequent white tablets once  daily at the same time each day for a total of 84 days. </li>
<li>Take one <span class="Bold">green</span> tablet (inert)  daily for the following 7 days and at the same time of day that active tablets were taken. A scheduled period should occur during the 7 days that the green tablets are taken. </li>
<li>Begin the next and all subsequent 91-day   courses of Iclevia without interruption on the same day of the week (i.e., Sunday) on which the patient began her first dose. Follow the same schedule as the initial 91-day course: a white tablet once a day for 84 days, and a green tablet once a day for 7 days. If the patient does not immediately start her next pill pack, instruct her to protect herself from pregnancy by using a non-hormonal back-up method of contraception until she has taken a white tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.</li>

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Thrombotic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Stop Iclevia if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs.</li>
<li>Stop Iclevia if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately.</li>
<li>If feasible, stop Iclevia at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization.</li>
<li>Start Iclevia no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.</li>
<li>The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman- years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued.</li>
<li>Use of Iclevia provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly COCs containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 weeks of exposure per year). In the clinical trial, one case of pulmonary embolism was reported. Postmarketing adverse reactions of VTE have been reported in women who used Iclevia.</li>
<li>Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. Stroke has been reported in women associated with the use of Iclevia. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke.</li>
<li>Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.</li>
</ul><h3>Liver Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Impaired Liver Function</span></p><p>Do not use Iclevia in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Iclevia if jaundice develops.</p><p><span class="Bold">Liver</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Tumors</span></p><p>Iclevia is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt; 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.</p><h3>Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment</h3><p class="First">During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains obmitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue Iclevia prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span> Iclevia can be restarted approximately <span class="following_xmChange">2</span> weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.</p><h3>High Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Iclevia is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span> For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Iclevia if blood pressure rises significantly.</p><p>An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin.</p><h3>Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease.</p><p>A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC-related cholestasis.</p><h3>Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</h3><p class="First">Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Iclevia. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance.</p><p>Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.</p><p>Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.</p><h3>Headache</h3><p class="First">If a woman taking Iclevia develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Iclevia if indicated.</p><p>Consider discontinuation of Iclevia in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea</h3><p class="First">Bleeding and/or spotting that occurs at any time while taking the first 84 tablets of each extended-cycle regimen is considered “unscheduled” bleeding/spotting. Bleeding that occurs during the time a woman takes the seven green inert tablets is considered “scheduled” bleeding.</p><p><span class="Bold">Unscheduled and Scheduled Bleeding and Spotting</span></p><p>Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles on Iclevia, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.</p><p>Before prescribing Iclevia, advise the woman to weigh the convenience of fewer scheduled menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting.</p><p>The clinical trial of the efficacy of Iclevia (91-day cycles) in preventing pregnancy also assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the study were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously as opposed to new users. Women with a history of breakthrough bleeding/spotting ≥ 10 consecutive days on oral contraceptives were excluded from the study. More Iclevia subjects, compared to subjects on the comparator 28-day cycle regimen, discontinued prematurely for unacceptable bleeding (7.7% [Iclevia] vs. 1.8% [28-day cycle regimen]).</p><p>Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 3 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting for each respective 91-day cycle.</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>Table 4 shows the percentages of women with ≥ 7 days and ≥ 20 days of unscheduled spotting and/or bleeding in the Iclevia and the 28-day cycle treatment groups.</p><p>Total days of bleeding and/or spotting (scheduled plus unscheduled) were similar over one year of treatment for Iclevia subjects and subjects on the 28-day cycle regimen.</p><p><span class="Bold">Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea</span></p><p>Women who are not pregnant and use Iclevia may experience amenorrhea. Based on data from the clinical trial, amenorrhea occurred in approximately 0.8% of women during Cycle 1, 1.2% of women during Cycle 2, 3.7% of women during Cycle 3, and 3.4% of women during Cycle 4. Because women using Iclevia will likely have scheduled bleeding only 4 times per year, rule out pregnancy at the time of any missed menstrual period.</p><p>Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</p><h3>COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Iclevia use if pregnancy is confirmed.</p><p>Administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Depression</h3><p class="First">Depression associated with the use of Iclevia has been reported. Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Iclevia if severe depression recurs.</p><h3>Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Iclevia is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></li>
</ul><p class="First">There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</li>
</ul><h3>Effect on Binding Globulins</h3><p class="First">The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.</p><h3>Monitoring</h3><p class="First">A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated health care.</p><h3>Hereditary Angioedema</h3><p class="First">In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.</p><h3>Chloasma</h3><p class="First">Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to develop chloasma should avoid prolonged exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Iclevia.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Serious cardiovascular events and stroke <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Vascular events <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Liver disease <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
</ul><p>Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Irregular uterine bleeding</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Breast tenderness</li>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Iclevia was a 12-month, randomized, multicenter, open-label study, which enrolled women aged 18 to 40, of whom 456 took at least one dose of Iclevia (345.14 woman-years of exposure) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation</span>: 14.9% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions (≥ 1% of women) leading to discontinuation in the Iclevia group were menorrhagia (5.7%), mood swings (1.9%), weight/appetite increase (1.5%), and acne (1.3%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Common Adverse Reactions (</span>≥ <span class="Bold">2% of women)</span>: headache (20.6%), menorrhagia (11.6%), nausea (7.5%), dysmenorrhea (5.7%), acne (4.6%), migraine (4.4%), breast tenderness (3.5%), weight increased (3.1%), and depression (2.1%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Serious Adverse Reactions:</span> pulmonary embolus, cholecystitis.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Iclevia. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal disorders</span>: abdominal distension, vomiting</p><p><span class="Italics">General disorders and administration site conditions</span>: chest pain, fatigue, malaise, edema peripheral, pain</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune system disorder: h</span>ypersensitivity reactions, including itching, rash, and angioedema</p><p><span class="Italics">Investigations:</span> blood pressure increased</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders</span>: muscle spasms, pain in extremity</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous system disorders</span>: dizziness, loss of consciousness</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric disorders</span>: insomnia</p><p><span class="Italics">Reproductive and breast disorders</span>: dysmenorrhea</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders</span>: alopecia</p><p><span class="Italics">Vascular disorders</span>: thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary thrombosis</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations.</p><h3>Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminishing the efficacy of COCs:</span></p><p>Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability.</p><p><span class="Bold">Colesevelam</span>: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart.</p><p><span class="Bold">Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs:</span></p><p>Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors:</span></p><p>Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos) amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]).</p><h3>Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs</h3><p class="First">COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations.</p><p>COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.</p><p>Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.12)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>Concomitant Use with Hepatitis C Vaccine (HCV) Combination Therapy-Liver Enzyme Elevation</h3><p class="First">Do not co-administer Iclevia with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Interactions with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use COCs during early pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy.<br/>
<br/>
Do not administer COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding as a test for pregnancy. Do not use COCs during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Advise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception, when possible, until she has weaned her child. COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well established; however, it can occur at any time in some women. Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites are present in breast milk.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of Iclevia have been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 as for users 18 years and older. Use of Iclevia before menarche is not indicated.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Iclevia has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of Iclevia have not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment. However, steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic impairment. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of Iclevia have not been studied in women with renal impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There have been no reports of serious ill effects from overdose of oral contraceptives, including ingestion by children. Overdosage may cause withdrawal bleeding in females and nausea.</p><h2>Iclevia Description</h2><p class="First">Iclevia (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP) is an extended-cycle combination oral contraceptive consisting of 84 white active tablets each containing 0.15 mg of levonorgestrel USP, a synthetic progestin and 0.03 mg of ethinyl estradiol USP, an estrogen, and 7 green inert tablets (without hormones).</p><p>The structural formulas for the active components are:<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Levonorgestrel is chemically 18,19-Dinorpregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one, 13-ethyl-17-hydroxy-, (17α)-, (-)-.</p><p> </p><p>Ethinyl Estradiol is 19-Norpregna-1,3,5(10)-trien-20-yne-3,17-diol, (17α)-.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Each white active tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and povidone. </li>
<li>Each green inert tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: anhydrous lactose, croscarmellose sodium, FD&amp;C Blue No.2 Aluminum Lake, ferric oxide yellow, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and povidone.</li>
</ul><h2>Iclevia - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">COCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation. Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with Iclevia.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>No specific investigation of the absolute bioavailability of Iclevia in humans has been conducted. However, literature indicates that levonorgestrel is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration (bioavailability nearly 100%) and is not subject to first-pass metabolism. EE is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but, due to first-pass metabolism in gut mucosa and liver, the bioavailability of EE is approximately 43%.</p><p>Following continuous dosing with once-daily administration of Iclevia tablets, plasma concentrations of levonorgestrel and EE reached steady-state within 7 days. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters for Iclevia under fasting conditions in normal healthy women following once-daily administration of one levonorgestrel/EE combination tablet for 10 days are summarized in Table 5.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Italics">Food Effect</span></p><p>The effect of food on the rate and the extent of levonorgestrel and EE absorption following oral administration of Iclevia has not been evaluated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The apparent volume of distribution of levonorgestrel and EE are reported to be approximately 1.8 L/kg and 4.3 L/kg, respectively. Levonorgestrel is about 97.5 to 99% protein-bound, principally to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and, to a lesser extent, serum albumin. EE is about 95 to 97% bound to serum albumin. EE does not bind to SHBG, but induces SHBG synthesis, which leads to decreased levonorgestrel clearance. Following repeated daily dosing of levonorgestrel/EE oral contraceptives, levonorgestrel plasma concentrations accumulate more than predicted based on single-dose pharmacokinetics, due in part, to increased SHBG levels that are induced by EE, and a possible reduction in hepatic metabolic capacity.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Following absorption, levonorgestrel is conjugated at the 17β-OH position to form sulfate and to a lesser extent, glucuronide conjugates in plasma. Significant amounts of conjugated and unconjugated 3α,5β-­tetrahydrolevonorgestrel are also present in plasma, along with much smaller amounts of 3α,5α­-tetrahydrolevonorgestrel and 16β-hydroxylevonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel and its phase I metabolites are excreted primarily as glucuronide conjugates. Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several-fold, and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users.</p><p>First-pass metabolism of EE involves formation of EE-3-sulfate in the gut wall, followed by 2-hydroxylation of a portion of the remaining untransformed EE by hepatic cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Levels of CYP3A4 vary widely among individuals and can explain the variation in rates of EE hydroxylation. Hydroxylation at the 4-, 6-, and 16-positions may also occur, although to a much lesser extent than 2-hydroxylation. The various hydroxylated metabolites are subject to further methylation and/or conjugation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>About 45% of levonorgestrel and its metabolites are excreted in the urine and about 32% are excreted in feces, mostly as glucuronide conjugates. The terminal elimination half-life for levonorgestrel after a single dose of Iclevia was about 30 hours.</p><p>EE is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, and it undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. The terminal elimination half-life of EE after a single dose of Iclevia was found to be about 15 hours.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In a 12-month, multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial, 456 women aged 18 to 40 were studied to assess the safety and efficacy of Iclevia, completing 809 91-day cycles of exposure. The racial demographic of those enrolled was: Caucasian (77%), African-American (11%), Hispanic (7%), Asian (2%), and Other (3%).<br/>
<br/>
There were no exclusions for body mass index (BMI) or weight. The weight range of those women treated was 84 to 304 pounds, with a mean weight of 157 pounds and a median weight of 147 pounds. Among the women in the trial, 63% were current or recent hormonal contraceptive users, 29% were prior users (who had used hormonal contraceptives in the past but not in the 6 months prior to enrollment), and 8% were new starts.<br/>
<br/>
The pregnancy rate (Pearl Index [PI]) in the 397 women aged 18 to 35 years was 1.98 pregnancies per 100 women-years of use (95% CI: 0.54 to 5.03), based on 4 pregnancies that occurred after the onset of treatment and within 14 days after the last combination pill. Cycles in which conception did not occur, but which included the use of back-up contraception, were not included in the calculation of the PI.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First">Iclevia (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP) are available in Extended-Cycle Wallets, each containing a 13-week supply of tablets in the following order:</p><ul class="Disc">

<li>Take <span class="Bold">1</span> pill every day at the same time. Take the pills in the order directed on your wallet.</li>
<li>Do not skip your pills, even if you do not have sex often. If you miss pills (including starting the pack late) <span class="Bold">you could get pregnant</span>. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant.</li>
<li>If you have trouble remembering to take Iclevia, talk to your healthcare provider.</li>
<li>When you first start taking Iclevia, spotting or light bleeding in between your periods may occur. Contact your healthcare provider if this does not go away after a few months.</li>
<li>You may feel sick to your stomach (nauseous), especially during the first few months of taking Iclevia. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If your nausea does not go away, call your healthcare provider.</li>
<li>Missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you take the missed pills later. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills (see <span class="Bold">What should I do if I miss any</span> <span class="Bold">Iclevia pi</span><span class="Bold">lls?</span> below), you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.</li>
<li>It is not uncommon to miss a period. However, if you miss a period and have not taken Iclevia according to directions, or feel like you may be pregnant, call your healthcare provider. If you have a positive pregnancy test, you should stop taking Iclevia.</li>
<li>If you have vomiting or diarrhea within <span class="Bold">3 to 4</span> hours of taking a white pill, take another white pill as soon as possible. Continue taking one pill a day until the 91-day course is finished.</li>
<li>If you have vomiting or diarrhea for more than 1 day, your birth control pills may not work as well. Use an additional birth control method, like condoms or spermicide, until you check with your healthcare provider.</li>
<li>Stop taking Iclevia at least <span class="Bold">4</span> weeks before you have major surgery and do not restart after the surgery without asking your healthcare provider. Be sure to use other forms of contraception (like condoms or spermicide) during this time period.</li>
