</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Description:</span> Calcium-Folic Acid Plus D Chewable Wafers are a chewable Calcium and Folic Acid Formula with Vitamin D, Magnesium and other nutrients for the maintenance and support of special dietary needs of any individual where supplementation with the ingredients contained within would prove beneficial including: premenopausal, menopausal and postmenopausal patients pertaining to the loss of calcium or calcium deficit, as well as cardiovascular wellness managed through dietary therapy.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Other Ingredients:</span> Fructose, Natural Cocoa Dutch Chocolate, Stearic Acid, Plasdone, Natural Chocolate Flavor, Magnesium Stearate, Acacia Gum, Silicon Dioxide.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nutrition Information:</span> Each wafer contains 11 calories and 2 grams of carbohydrates.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Indications and Usage:</span> Calcium-Folic Acid Plus D Chewable Wafers are indicated, in addition to diet, to help satisfy the distinctive nutritional requirements of individuals under the supervision of a physician for the treatment of calcium deficiency, skeletal weakness and osteoporosis. Calcium-Folic Acid Plus D Chewable Wafers supplementation may be beneficial to individuals who have an insufficient dietary intake of the nutrients contained therein. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may be useful in both preventing and treating osteoporosis. Vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial to those who are institutionalized and/or have reduced exposure to sunlight. Folic acid, vitamin B <span class="Sub">6</span>, and vitamin B <span class="Sub">12</span>, may help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by lowering blood levels of homocysteine. If dietary intake of calcium is inadequate, patients currently taking bisphosphonates for treatment of osteoporosis should be instructed to take calcium and vitamin D daily (Calcium-Folic Acid Plus D Chewable Wafers).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Contraindications:</span> Calcium-Folic Acid Plus D Chewable Wafers are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is contraindicated in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia and those who form calcium containing stones are generally advised not to take supplemental calcium. Concomitant use of iron and calcium may inhibit the absorption of iron. Concomitant use of quinolones or tetracyclines with calcium may decrease the absorption of these medications. Folic acid is contraindicated in patients with untreated and uncomplicated pernicious anemia, and in those with anaphylactic sensitivity to folic acid. The use of folic acid doses above 1 milligram/day may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B <span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency. High doses of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of the anticonvulsant drugs; carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, phenytoin, phenobarbitol and valproic acid.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Precautions:</span> Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span> As little as 5 mg of pyridoxine (vitamin B <span class="Sub">6</span>) daily can decrease the efficacy of levodopa. Therefore, Calcium-Folic Acid Plus D Chewable Wafers are not recommended for patients undergoing such therapy.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Information for Patients:</span> Calcium-Folic Acid Plus D Chewable Wafers are medical food for use only under the direction and supervision of a licensed physician.

However, allergic and/or idiosyncratic reactions to vitamins even at lower potencies or any ingredient are possible.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Warning: Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dosage and Administration:</span> Chew one wafer twice daily or as prescribed by a physician.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">How Supplied:</span> Brown-mottled, round shaped wafer, debossed on scored side with “BP 706”, plain on the other side.
