Before you take Mozobil, tell your doctor if you have kidney disease.</p><p><b>Plerixafor may harm an unborn baby.</b> Use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy while you are using Mozobil and for at least 1 week after your last dose. Tell your doctor if you become pregnant.</p><p>You may need to have a negative pregnancy test before starting this treatment.</p><p>You should not breastfeed while receiving this medication.</p><h2>How is Mozobil given?</h2><p>Mozobil is injected under the skin. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>You will be watched closely for at least 30 minutes to make sure you do not have an allergic reaction.</p><p>Before receiving Mozobil, you will be given a medication called a granulocyte (GRAN-yoo-loe-site) colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). A G-CSF helps your body produce stem cells and white blood cells to help support your immune system.</p><p>Mozobil works together with the G-CSF by causing stem cells and granulocytes produced in the bone marrow to circulate into your bloodstream where they can be collected in blood drawn from your vein.</p><p>After your blood is drawn, it will be processed so that the needed stem cells and granulocytes can be separated from other unneeded parts of the blood. These stem cells and granulocytes will then be "transplanted" back into your body.</p><p>Your blood will need to be tested often during your treatment.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma:</b></p><p>Dosing Based on Actual Patient Body Weight:<br/>
