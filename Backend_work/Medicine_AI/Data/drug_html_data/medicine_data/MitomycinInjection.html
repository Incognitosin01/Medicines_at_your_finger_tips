LG-UTUC is a type of cancer of the lining of the upper urinary tract (eg, lining of the kidney).</p><p>Mitomycin interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are then destroyed by the body.</p><p>Mitomycin is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using mitomycin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For mitomycin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to mitomycin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of mitomycin injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of mitomycin injection in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

When you are receiving mitomycin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using mitomycin with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of mitomycin</h2><p>Before receiving mitomycin, make sure you understand all the risks and benefits. It is important for you to work closely with your doctor during your treatment.</p><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you mitomycin in a medical facility. Mitomycin is given to your kidney through a tube called a catheter (eg, ureteral catheter or nephrostomy tube).</p><p>Mitomycin is given once a week for 6 weeks. If mitomycin is working properly after 3 months of treatment, you may receive it once a month for 11 months.</p><p>Your doctor will tell you to take sodium bicarbonate before each treatment with mitomycin. Follow your doctor's instructions about how and when to take this.</p><h3>Missed dose</h3><p>Mitomycin needs to be given on a fixed schedule. If you miss a dose, call your doctor, home health caregiver, or treatment clinic for instructions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using mitomycin</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check you closely</i> to make sure that mitomycin is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Receiving mitomycin while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control during treatment with mitomycin and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Male patients with female partners should use an effective form of birth control during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Mitomycin may cause ureteric obstruction (swelling and narrowing of the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder). Check with your doctor right away if you have fever, lower back or side pain, or trouble in urinating.</p><p>Mitomycin can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>Mitomycin may cause your urine to change to a violet to blue color. It is recommended to do the following after receiving mitomycin:</p><ul>
<li>Avoid skin contact with urine for at least 6 hours.</li>
<li>Male and female patients should sit on the toilet when urinating and flush it several times after using.</li>
<li>Wash your hands, inner thighs, and genital area well with soap and water after going to the bathroom.</li>
<li>Wash the clothing soiled with urine right away and separately from any other clothing.</li>
</ul><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Mitomycin side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
