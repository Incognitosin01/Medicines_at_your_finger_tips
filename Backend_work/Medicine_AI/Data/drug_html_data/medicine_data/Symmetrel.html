It is used to prevent or treat certain influenza (flu) infections (type A). It may be given alone or together with flu shots. Amantadine will not work for colds, other types of flu, or other virus infections.</p><p>Amantadine is also an antidyskinetic medicine. It is used to treat Parkinson's disease (sometimes called "paralysis agitans" or "shaking palsy") and its symptoms, including dyskinesia (sudden uncontrolled movements). It may be given alone or in combination with other medicines (eg, levodopa) for Parkinson's disease. By improving muscle control and reducing stiffness, this medicine allows more normal movements of the body as the disease symptoms are reduced. Amantadine is also used to treat stiffness and shakiness caused by certain medicines that are used to treat nervous, mental, and emotional conditions.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Symmetrel</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>Symmetrel®</i> in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 1 year of age.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Gocovri®</i> and <i>Osmolex ER™</i> in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of amantadine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart disease, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving <i>Symmetrel®</i>. Elderly patients are also more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, falls, hallucinations) and age-related kidney disease, which may require caution in patients receiving <i>Gocovri®</i> and <i>Osmolex ER™</i>.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding.

It may not be specific to Symmetrel. Please read with care.</b></p><p><i>For patients taking amantadine to prevent or treat flu infections</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Talk to your doctor about the possibility of getting a flu shot if you have not had one yet.</li>
<li>This medicine is best taken before exposure or right away after exposure to people who have the flu.</li>
<li>To help keep yourself from getting the flu, keep taking this medicine for the full time of treatment. Or if you already have the flu, continue taking this medicine for the full time of treatment even if you begin to feel better after a few days. This will help clear up your infection completely. If you stop taking this medicine too soon, your symptoms may return. This medicine should be taken for at least 2 days after all your flu symptoms have disappeared.</li>
<li>This medicine works best when there is a constant amount in the blood. To help keep the amount constant, do not miss any doses. Also, it is best to take the doses at evenly spaced times at day and night. For example, if you are to take two doses a day, the doses should be spaced about 12 hours apart. If this interferes with your sleep or other daily activities, or if you need help in planning the best times to take your medicine, check with your doctor.</li>
<li>If you are using the oral liquid form of amantadine, use a marked measuring spoon, oral syringe, or medicine cup to measure each dose correctly. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.</li>
</ul><p><i>For patients taking amantadine for Parkinson's disease or movement problems (including dyskinesia) caused by certain medicines used to treat nervous, mental, and emotional conditions</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.</li>
<li>This medicine comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</li>
<li>Do not stop using this medicine suddenly without asking your doctor. You may need to slowly decrease your dose before stopping it completely.</li>
<li>Improvement in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease usually occurs in about 2 days. However, in some patients, this medicine must be taken for up to 2 weeks before the full benefit is seen.</li>
</ul><p>Take <i>Gocovri® extended-release capsule</i> at bedtime. Swallow whole. Do not crush, break, or chew it.

Do not crush, open, or chew it.</p><p>Do not use <i>Symmetrel®</i> if you have received the nasal flu vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine) in the past 2 weeks or if you will receive the vaccine within 48 hours, unless your doctor says it is okay.</p><p>Do not drink alcohol while you are using this medicine.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.

It may also cause some people to have suicidal thoughts and tendencies or to become more depressed. Also tell your doctor if you have sudden or strong feelings, such as feeling nervous, angry, restless, violent, or scared. If you, your child, or your caregiver notice any of these adverse effects, tell your doctor or your child's doctor right away.</p><p>Some people who have used this medicine had unusual changes in their behavior. Talk with your doctor right away if you start having unusual urges, such as gambling urges, binge or compulsive eating, compulsive shopping, or sexual urges while using this medicine.</p><p>Drinking alcoholic beverages while taking this medicine may cause increased side effects, such as circulation problems, dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, or confusion. Do not drink alcoholic beverages while you are taking this medicine.</p><p>This medicine may cause some people to become dizzy, drowsy, or lightheaded, or to have blurred vision or trouble concentrating. <i>Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you</i>.</p><p>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur with this medicine, especially when you suddenly get up from a lying or sitting position. These symptoms are more likely to occur when you begin taking this medicine or when the dose is increased. Getting up slowly may help. If this problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.</p><p>Patients with Parkinson's disease must be careful not to overdo physical activities when their condition improves and body movements become easier, since injuries resulting from falls may occur. Such activities must be gradually increased to give your body time to adjust to a change in balance, circulation, and coordination.</p><p>Amantadine may cause dryness of the mouth, nose, and throat. For temporary relief of mouth dryness, use sugarless candy or gum, melted bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. If your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your doctor or dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.</p><p>This medicine may cause purplish red, net-like, blotchy spots on the skin. This problem occurs more often in females and usually occurs on the legs or feet after this medicine has been taken regularly for a month or more. Although the blotchy spots may remain as long as you are taking this medicine, they will usually go away gradually within 2 to 12 weeks after you stop taking the medicine. If you have any questions about this, talk with your doctor.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you are having convulsions (seizures), difficulty with breathing, a fast heartbeat, a high fever, high or low blood pressure, increased sweating, loss of bladder control, severe muscle stiffness, unusually pale skin, or tiredness. These could be symptoms of a serious condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).</p><p>If you are using this medicine for Parkinson's disease, <i>do not stop taking this medicine suddenly without first checking with your doctor</i>. Your doctor may want you to slowly reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely.</p><p>If you are using this medicine for Parkinson's disease, it is important that your doctor check your skin regularly for signs of melanoma (skin cancer). If you notice any unusual red, brown, or black spots on your skin, check with your doctor right away.</p><p>If your Parkinson's symptoms do not improve within a few days, if they become worse, or if this medicine appears less effective after a few weeks, check with your doctor.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor.
