Dihydroergotamine mesylate is known chemically as ergotaman-3', 6', 18-trione, 9,10-dihydro-12'-hydroxy-2'-methyl-5'- (phenylmethyl)-, (5'α)-, monomethane-sulfonate.

It also binds with high affinity to serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span>, and 5-HT<span class="Sub">2C</span> receptors, noradrenaline α<span class="Sub">2A</span>, α<span class="Sub">2B</span> and α<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors, and dopamine D<span class="Sub">2L</span> and D<span class="Sub">3</span> receptors.</p><p>The therapeutic activity of dihydroergotamine in migraine is generally attributed to the agonist effect at 5-HT<span class="Sub">1D</span> receptors. Two current theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1D</span> receptor agonists in migraine. One theory suggests that activation of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1D</span> receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on arterio-venous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which correlates with the relief of migraine headache. The alternative hypothesis suggests that activation of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1D</span> receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. In addition, dihydroergotamine possesses oxytocic properties <span class="Italics">(see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></span></p><p>Dihydroergotamine mesylate is poorly bioavailable following oral administration. Following intranasal administration, however, the mean bioavailability of dihydroergotamine mesylate is 32% relative to the injectable administration. Absorption is variable, probably reflecting both intersubject differences of absorption and the technique used for self-administration.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></span></p><p>Dihydroergotamine mesylate is 93% plasma protein bound. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 800 liters.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></span></p><p>Four dihydroergotamine mesylate metabolites have been identified in human plasma following oral administration. The major metabolite, 8'-β-hydroxydihydroergotamine, exhibits affinity equivalent to its parent for adrenergic and 5-HT receptors and demonstrates equivalent potency in several venoconstrictor activity models, <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. The other metabolites, i.e., dihydrolysergic acid, dihydrolysergic amide and a metabolite formed by oxidative opening of the proline ring are of minor importance. Following nasal administration, total metabolites represent only 20%-30% of plasma AUC. The systemic clearance of dihydroergotamine mesylate following I.V. and I.M. administration is 1.5 L/min. Quantitative pharmacokinetic characterization of the four metabolites has not been performed.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></span></p><p>The major excretory route of dihydroergotamine is via the bile in the feces. After intranasal administration the urinary recovery of parent drug amounts to about 2% of the administered dose compared to 6% after I.M. administration. The total body clearance is 1.5 L/min which reflects mainly hepatic clearance. The renal clearance (0.1 L/min) is unaffected by the route of dihydroergotamine administration. The decline of plasma dihydroergotamine is biphasic with a terminal half-life of about 10 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Subpopulations</span></span></p><p>No studies have been conducted on the effect of renal or hepatic impairment, gender, race, or ethnicity on dihydroergotamine pharmacokinetics. Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray is contraindicated in patients with severely impaired hepatic or renal function <span class="Italics">(see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Interactions</span></span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of dihydroergotamine did not appear to be significantly affected by the concomitant use of a local vasoconstrictor (e.g., fenoxazoline).</p><p>Multiple oral doses of the β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, used for migraine prophylaxis, had no significant influence on the C<span class="Sub">max</span>, T<span class="Sub">max</span> or AUC of dihydroergotamine doses up to 4 mg.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic interactions have been reported in patients treated orally with other ergot alkaloids (e.g., increased levels of ergotamine) and macrolide antibiotics, principally troleandomycin, presumably due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A metabolism of the alkaloids by troleandomycin. Dihydroergotamine has also been shown to be an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A catalyzed reactions and rare reports of ergotism have been obtained from patients treated with dihydroergotamine and macrolide antibiotics (e.g., troleandomycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin), and in patients treated with dihydroergotamine and protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir), presumably due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A metabolism of ergotamine <span class="Italics">(see CONTRAINDICATIONS)</span>. No pharmacokinetic interactions involving other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are known.</p><h2>Clinical Trials</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray for the acute treatment of migraine headaches was evaluated in four randomized, double blind, placebo controlled studies in the U.S. The patient population for the trials was predominantly female (87%) and Caucasian (95%) with a mean age of 39 years (range 18 to 65 years). Patients treated a single moderate to severe migraine headache with a single dose of study medication and assessed pain severity over the 24 hours following treatment. Headache response was determined 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after dosing and was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain. In studies 1 and 2, a four-point pain intensity scale was utilized; in studies 3 and 4, a five-point scale was used that included both pain response and restoration of function for "severe" or "incapacitating" pain, a less clear endpoint. Although rescue medication was allowed in all four studies, patients were instructed not to use them during the four hour observation period. In studies 3 and 4, a total dose of 2 mg was compared to placebo. In studies 1 and 2, doses of 2 and 3 mg were evaluated, and showed no advantage of the higher dose for a single treatment. In all studies, patients received a regimen consisting of 0.5 mg in each nostril, repeated in 15 minutes (and again in another 15 minutes for the 3 mg dose in studies 1 and 2).</p><p>The percentage of patients achieving headache response 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater in patients receiving 2 mg doses of dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray compared to those receiving placebo in 3 of the 4 studies (see Tables 1 &amp; 2 and Figures 1 &amp; 2).</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span>Headache response was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain.

Because studies are conducted at different times, with different samples of patients, by different investigators, employing different criteria and/or different interpretations of the same criteria, under different conditions (dose, dosing regimen, etc.), quantitative estimates of treatment response and the timing of response may be expected to vary considerably from study to study.</span></p><p>The Kaplan-Meier plots below (Figures 1 &amp; 2) provides an estimate of the probability that a patient will have responded to a single 2 mg dose of dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray as a function of the time elapsed since initiation of treatment.</p><p>*The figure shows the probability over time of obtaining a response following treatment with dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray. Headache response was based on pain intensity as interpreted by the patient using a four-point pain intensity scale. Patients not achieving response within 4 hours were censored to 4 hours.</p><p>*The figure shows the probability over time of obtaining a response following treatment with dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray. Headache response was evaluated on a five-point scale that confounded pain response and restoration of function for "severe" or "incapacitating" pain. Patients not achieving response within 4 hours were censored to 4 hours.</p><p>For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 and 4 hours following administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray compared to placebo.</p><p>Patients were not allowed to use additional treatments for eight hours prior to study medication dosing and during the four hour observation period following study treatment. Following the 4 hour observation period, patients were allowed to use additional treatments. For all studies, the estimated probability of patients using additional treatments for their migraines over the 24 hours following the single 2 mg dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 3 below.</p><p>*Kaplan-Meier plot based on data obtained from all studies with patients not using additional treatments censored to 24 hours. All patients received a single treatment of study medication for their migraine attack. The plot also includes patients who had no response to the initial dose.</p><p>Neither age nor sex appear to effect the patient's response to dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray. While patients with menstrual migraine, migraine with aura, and migraine without aura by medical history were included in the clinical evaluation of dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray, patients were not required to report the specific type of migraine treated with study medication. Thus, neither the effect of menses on migraine nor the presence or the absence of aura were assessed. The racial distribution of patients was insufficient to determine the effect of race on the efficacy of dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Dihydroergotamine Nasal Spray</h2><p class="First">Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura.</p><p>Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray is not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine or for the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">There have been a few reports of serious adverse events associated with the coadministration of dihydroergotamine and potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors, such as protease inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics, resulting in vasospasm that led to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. The use of potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, erythromycin, clarithromycin, troleandomycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole) with dihydroergotamine is, therefore contraindicated <span class="Italics">(see WARNINGS: CYP 3A4 Inhibitors)</span>.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray should not be given to patients with ischemic heart disease (angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, or documented silent ischemia) or to patients who have clinical symptoms or findings consistent with coronary artery vasospasm including Prinzmetal's variant angina <span class="Italics">(see WARNINGS).</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Because dihydroergotamine mesylate</span> <span class="Bold">nasal spray</span> <span class="Bold">may increase blood pressure, it should not be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Dihydroergotamine mesylate</span> <span class="Bold">nasal spray</span><span class="Bold">, 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists (e.g., sumatriptan), ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications or methysergide should not be used within 24 hours of each other.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray should not be administered to patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine.</span></p><p>In addition to those conditions mentioned above, dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray is also contraindicated in patients with known peripheral arterial disease, sepsis, following vascular surgery, and severely impaired hepatic or renal function.</p><p>Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Dihydroergotamine possesses oxytocic properties and, therefore, should not be administered during pregnancy. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p><p>There are no adequate studies of dihydroergotamine in human pregnancy, but developmental toxicity has been demonstrated in experimental animals. In embryofetal development studies of dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray, intranasal administration to pregnant rats throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weights and/or skeletal ossification at doses of 0.16 mg/day (associated with maternal plasma dihydroergotamine exposures [AUC] approximately 0.4 -1.2 times the exposures in humans receiving the MRDD of 4 mg) or greater. A no effect level for embryo-fetal toxicity was not established in rats. Delayed skeletal ossification was also noted in rabbit fetuses following intranasal administration of 3.6 mg/day (maternal exposures approximately 7 times human exposures at the MRDD) during organogenesis. A no effect level was seen at 1.2 mg/day (maternal exposures approximately 2.5 times human exposures at the MRDD). When dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray was administered intranasally to female rats during pregnancy and lactation, decreased body weights and impaired reproductive function (decreased mating indices) were observed in the offspring at doses of 0.16 mg/day or greater. A no effect level was not established. Effects on development occurred at doses below those that produced evidence of significant maternal toxicity in these studies. Dihydroergotamine-induced intrauterine growth retardation has been attributed to reduced uteroplacental blood flow resulting from prolonged vasoconstriction of the uterine vessels and/or increased myometrial tone.</p><p>Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray is contraindicated in patients who have previously shown hypersensitivity to ergot alkaloids.</p><p>Dihydroergotamine mesylate should not be used by nursing mothers <span class="Italics">(see PRECAUTIONS).</span></p><p>Dihydroergotamine mesylate should not be used with peripheral and central vasoconstrictors because the combination may result in additive or synergistic elevation of blood pressure.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">CYP 3A4 Inhibitors (e.g. Macrolide Antibiotics and Protease Inhibitors)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">There have been rare reports of serious adverse events in connection with the coadministration of dihydroergotamine and potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors, such as protease inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics, resulting in vasospasm that led to cerebral ischemia and/or and ischemia of the extremities. The use of potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors with dihydroergotamine should therefore be avoided <span class="Italics">(see CONTRAINDICATIONS)</span>. Examples of some of the more potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors include: antifungals ketoconazole and itraconazole, the protease inhibitors ritonavir, nelfinavir, and indinavir, and macrolide antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, and troleandomycin. Other less potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors should be administered with caution. Less potent inhibitors include saquinavir, nefazodone, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, zileuton, and clotrimazole. These lists are not exhaustive, and the prescriber should consider the effects on CYP 3A4 of other agents being considered for concomitant use with dihydroergotamine.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Fibrotic Complications</span></p><p>There have been reports of pleural and retroperitoneal fibrosis in patients following prolonged daily use of injectable dihydroergotamine mesylate. Rarely, prolonged daily use of other ergot alkaloid drugs has been associated with cardiac valvular fibrosis. Rare cases have also been reported in association with the use of injectable dihydroergotamine mesylate; however, in those cases, patients also received drugs known to be associated with cardiac valvular fibrosis.</p><p>Administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray, should not exceed the dosing guidelines and should not be used for chronic daily administration <span class="Italics">(see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Dihydroergotamine mesylate</span> <span class="Bold">nasal spray</span> <span class="Bold">should not be used by patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease <span class="Italics">(see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</span> It is strongly recommended that dihydroergotamine mesylate</span> <span class="Bold">nasal spray</span> <span class="Bold">not be given to patients in whom unrecognized coronary artery disease (CAD) is predicted by the presence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, females who are surgically or physiologically postmenopausal, or males who are over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patient's medical history or electrocardiographic investigations reveal findings indicative of or consistent with coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, dihydroergotamine should not be administered <span class="Italics">(see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of dihydroergotamine mesylate</span> <span class="Bold">nasal spray</span> <span class="Bold">take place in the setting of a physician's office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received dihydroergotamine mesylate.

However, the potential for adverse cardiac events exists. Serious adverse cardiac events, including acute myocardial infarction, life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, and death have been reported to have occurred following the administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate injection (e.g., D.H.E. 45<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection). Considering the extent of use of dihydroergotamine mesylate in patients with migraine, the incidence of these events is extremely low.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug-Associated Cerebrovascular Events and Fatalities</span></p><p>Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with D.H.E. 45<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection; and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the D.H.E. 45<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. It should be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack).</p><p><span class="Bold">Other Vasospasm Related Events</span></p><p>Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray, like other ergot alkaloids, may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm. Myocardial and peripheral vascular ischemia have been reported with dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray.</p><p>Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray associated vasospastic phenomena may also cause muscle pains, numbness, coldness, pallor, and cyanosis of the digits. In patients with compromised circulation, persistent vasospasm may result in gangrene or death, dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray should be discontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of vasoconstriction develop.</p><p><span class="Bold">Increase in Blood Pressure</span></p><p>Significant elevation in blood pressure has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension treated with dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray and dihydroergotamine mesylate injection.

Irritative symptoms include congestion, burning sensation, dryness, paraesthesia, discharge, epistaxis, pain, or soreness. The symptoms were predominantly mild to moderate in severity and transient. In approximately 70% of the above mentioned cases, the symptoms resolved within four hours after dosing with dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray. Examinations of the nose and throat in a small subset (N = 66) of study participants treated for up to 36 months (range 1-36 months) did not reveal any clinically noticeable injury. Other than this limited number of patients, the consequences of extended and repeated use of dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray on the nasal and/or respiratory mucosa have not been systematically evaluated in patients.</p><p>Nasal tissue in animals treated with dihydroergotamine mesylate daily at nasal cavity surface area exposures (in mg/mm<span class="Sup">2</span>) that were equal to or less than those achieved in humans receiving the maximum recommended daily dose of 0.08 mg/kg/day showed mild mucosal irritation characterized by mucous cell and transitional cell hyperplasia and squamous cell metaplasia.

Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray in placebo-controlled trials and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (n=1796) exposed to dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Skin and Appendages:</span></span> </p><p><span class="Italics">Infrequent:</span> petechia, pruritus, rash, cold clammy skin;</p><p><span class="Italics">Rare:</span> papular rash, urticaria, herpes simplex.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span></span> </p><p><span class="Italics">Infrequent:</span> cramps, myalgia, muscular weakness, dystonia;</p><p><span class="Italics">Rare:</span> arthralgia, involuntary muscle contractions, rigidity.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Central and Peripheral Nervous System:</span></span> </p><p><span class="Italics">Infrequent:</span> confusion, tremor, hypoesthesia, vertigo;</p><p><span class="Italics">Rare</span>: speech disorder, hyperkinesia, stupor, abnormal gait, aggravated migraine.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Autonomic Nervous System:</span></span> <span class="Italics">Infrequent:</span> increased sweating.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Special Senses:</span></span> </p><p><span class="Italics">Infrequent:</span> sense of smell altered, photophobia, conjunctivitis, abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, tinnitus, earache;</p><p><span class="Italics">Rare:</span> eye pain.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Psychiatric:</span></span> </p><p><span class="Italics">Infrequent:</span> nervousness, euphoria, insomnia, concentration impaired;</p><p>Rare: anxiety, anorexia, depression.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span></span> </p><p><span class="Italics">Infrequent:</span> abdominal pain, dyspepsia, dysphagia, hiccup;</p><p><span class="Italics">Rare:</span> increased salivation, esophagospasm.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Infrequent:</span> edema, palpitation, tachycardia;</p><p><span class="Italics">Rare:</span> hypotension, peripheral ischemia, angina.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Respiratory System:</span></span> </p><p><span class="Italics">Infrequent:</span> dyspnea, upper respiratory tract infections;</p><p><span class="Italics">Rare:</span> bronchospasm, bronchitis, pleural pain, epistaxis.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Urinary System:</span></span> </p><p><span class="Italics">Infrequent:</span> increased frequency of micturition, cystitis.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Reproductive, Female:</span></span> </p><p><span class="Italics">Rare:</span> pelvic inflammation, vaginitis.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole - General:</span></span> </p><p><span class="Italics">Infrequent:</span> feeling cold, malaise, rigors, fever, periorbital edema;</p><p><span class="Italics">Rare:</span> flu-like symptoms<span class="Italics">,</span> shock, loss of voice, yawning<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Application Site:</span></span> </p><p><span class="Italics">Infrequent:</span> local anesthesia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Post-introduction Reports</span></p><p>Voluntary reports of adverse events temporally associated with dihydroergotamine products used in the management of migraine that have been received since the introduction of the injectable formulation are included in this section save for those already listed above.

However, cases of drug abuse and psychological dependence in patients on other forms of ergot therapy have been reported. Thus, due to the chronicity of vascular headaches, it is imperative that patients be advised not to exceed recommended dosages.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">To date, there have been no reports of acute overdosage with this drug. Due to the risk of vascular spasm, exceeding the recommended dosages of dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray is to be avoided.</p><p>Excessive doses of dihydroergotamine may result in peripheral signs and symptoms of ergotism. Treatment includes discontinuance of the drug, local application of warmth to the affected area, the administration of vasodilators, and nursing care to prevent tissue damage.</p><p>In general, the symptoms of an acute dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray overdose are similar to those of an ergotamine overdose, although there is less pronounced nausea and vomiting with dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray. The symptoms of an ergotamine overdose include the following: numbness, tingling, pain, and cyanosis of the extremities associated with diminished or absent peripheral pulses; respiratory depression; an increase and/or decrease in blood pressure, usually in that order; confusion, delirium, convulsions, and coma; and/or some degree of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.</p><p>In laboratory animals, significant lethality occurs when dihydroergotamine is given at I.V. doses of 44 mg/kg in mice, 130 mg/kg in rats, and 37 mg/kg in rabbits.</p><p>Up-to-date information about the treatment of overdosage can often be obtained from a certified Regional Poison Control Center.

Do not try to use it to prevent a headache if you have no symptoms. Do not use it to treat common tension headache or a headache that is not at all typical of your usual migraine headache. Administration of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray, should not exceed the dosing guidelines and should not be used for chronic daily administration. There have been reports of fibrosis (stiffening) in the lung or kidney areas in patients following prolonged daily use of injectable dihydroergotamine mesylate. Rarely, prolonged daily use of other ergot alkaloid drugs (the class of drugs to which Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray belongs) has been associated with heart valvular fibrosis. Rare cases have also been reported in association with the use of injectable dihydroergotamine mesylate; however, in those cases, patients also received drugs known to be associated with heart valvular fibrosis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Do not use Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray if you:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
