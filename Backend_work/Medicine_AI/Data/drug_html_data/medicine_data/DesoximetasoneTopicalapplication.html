Desoximetasone topical <i>spray</i> is used to treat plaque psoriasis in adults. Desoximetasone is a corticosteroid (cortisone-like medicine or steroid).</p><p>Desoximetasone is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using desoximetasone</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For desoximetasone, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to desoximetasone or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of desoximetasone topical spray in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of desoximetasone in children 10 years of age or older. However, because of desoximetasone's toxicity, it should be used with caution. Children and teenagers who must use desoximetasone should be checked often by their doctor since desoximetasone topical may be absorbed through the skin and can affect growth or cause other unwanted effects. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 10 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of desoximetasone topical spray in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving desoximetasone topical spray.</p><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of desoximetasone topical in geriatric patients.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of desoximetasone. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>

Desoximetasone can cause serious side effects, especially in children, if it gets into the mouth and is swallowed.</p><p>Using too much of desoximetasone or using it for a long time may increase your risk of having adrenal gland problems. The risk is greater for children and for patients who use large amounts for a long time. Talk to your doctor if you have more than one of these symptoms while you are using desoximetasone: blurred vision; dizziness or fainting; fast, irregular, or pounding heartbeat; increased thirst or urination; irritability; or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Stop using desoximetasone and check with your doctor right away if you have a skin rash, burning, stinging, swelling, or irritation on the skin.</p><p>Avoid using tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child if desoximetasone is being used on the child's diaper area. Plastic pants and tight-fitting diapers may increase the chance of absorption of the medicine through the skin and the chance of side effects.</p><p>Do not use desoximetasone together with other topical corticosteroid-containing medicines, such as betamethasone, hydrocortisone, triamcinolone, Cortaid®, or Lotrisone®. Using these medicines together may cause serious unwanted effects.</p><p>Do not use cosmetics or other skin care products on the treated skin areas.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Desoximetasone side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
