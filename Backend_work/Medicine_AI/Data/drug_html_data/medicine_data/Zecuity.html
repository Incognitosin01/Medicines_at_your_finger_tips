Sumatriptan also reduces substances in the body that can trigger headache pain, nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and other migraine symptoms.</p><p>Zecuity skin patches are used to treat migraine headaches in adults. Sumatriptan will only treat a headache that has already begun. It will not prevent headaches or reduce the number of attacks.</p><p>Zecuity should not be used to treat a common tension headache or a headache that causes loss of movement on one side of your body. Use this medicine only if your condition has been confirmed by a doctor as migraine headaches.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Zecuity if you have any history of heart disease or coronary artery disease, blood circulation problems, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, uncontrolled high blood pressure, severe liver disease, circulation problems affecting your intestines, history of a stroke, or if your headache seems to be different from your usual migraine headaches.</p><p>Do not use Zecuity if you have used an MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days.
