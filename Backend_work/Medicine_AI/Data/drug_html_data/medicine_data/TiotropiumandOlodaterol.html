Elevated cAMP levels induce bronchodilation by relaxation of airway smooth muscle cells. Has much greater affinity for beta<sub>2</sub>-receptors than for beta<sub>1</sub>- or beta<sub>3</sub>-receptors.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>COPD: </b> Maintenance treatment of patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to tiotropium, ipratropium, olodaterol, or any component of the formulation; monotherapy (without use of a concomitant inhaled corticosteroid) in the treatment of asthma.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling: </i>Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Hypersensitivity to atropine.</p><p>Documentation of allergenic cross-reactivity for sympathomimetics is limited.

The use of LABAs as monotherapy has been associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations and asthma-related deaths (SMART 2006; Walters 2007); additional data from other clinical trials suggest risk of asthma-related hospitalization may also be increased with LABA monotherapy in pediatric and adolescent patients. However, data from large randomized, double-blind controlled trials do not show a significant increase in risk of serious asthma related events (including hospitalizations, intubations, and death) in adults, adolescents, and pediatric patients (aged 4 to 11 years of age) when fixed-dose LABAs are used with inhaled corticosteroids combined in a single inhaler compared with inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy (FDA 2017). Current guidelines recommend the use of an as-needed low dose inhaled corticosteroid with formoterol for patients with infrequent symptoms (GINA 2020). Tiotropium/olodaterol is not indicated for the treatment of asthma. Available data do not suggest an increased risk of death with use of LABA in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p><p>• Bronchospasm: Paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening may occur with use of inhaled beta-2 agonists; this should be distinguished from inadequate response. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue use and institute alternative therapy.</p><p>• CNS effects: May cause dizziness and blurred vision; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks that require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery, driving).</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, pruritus, rash, and urticaria may occur; discontinue immediately if signs/symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction occur.</p><p>• Serious effects/fatalities: Do not exceed recommended dose or frequency or use with other medications containing LABAs; serious adverse events, including fatalities, have been associated with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetics.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (eg, arrhythmias, coronary insufficiency, hypertension, and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy); beta-agonists may cause elevation in blood pressure and heart rate. Beta-2 agonists may also produce ECG changes (eg, T-wave flattening, QTc prolongation, ST segment depression).</p><p>• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus; beta-2 agonists may increase serum glucose and aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.</p><p>• Glaucoma: Use with caution in patients with narrow angle glaucoma; may increase intraocular pressure.</p><p>• Hyperthyroidism: Use with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism; beta-2 agonists may stimulate thyroid activity.</p><p>• Hypokalemia: Use with caution in patients with hypokalemia; beta-2 agonists may decrease serum potassium (transient).</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of &lt;60 mL/minute); monitor closely for anticholinergic adverse events.</p><p>• Seizures: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders; beta-2 agonists may result in CNS stimulation/excitation.</p><p>• Urinary retention: Use with caution in patients with urinary retention. Monitor for signs and symptoms of urinary retention, especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction.</p><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Pediatric: LABAs, when used as monotherapy, may increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. When LABAs are used in a fixed-dose combination with inhaled corticosteroids, data from large clinical trials in adolescents do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared to inhaled corticosteroids alone.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Not indicated for the initial (rescue) treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm or with acutely deteriorating or potentially life-threatening COPD; after initiation of therapy, patients should use short-acting bronchodilators only on an as needed basis for acute symptoms.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>FEV<sub>1</sub>, peak flow and/or other pulmonary function tests; anticholinergic adverse reactions (patients with CrCl ≤60 mL/minute); serum potassium; serum glucose; blood pressure, heart rate; CNS stimulation; signs and symptoms of glaucoma; hypersensitivity reactions; urinary retention.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this combination.
