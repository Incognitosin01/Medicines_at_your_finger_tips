It works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the virus.</p><p>Rubella (also known as German measles) is a serious infection that causes miscarriages, stillbirths, or birth defects in unborn babies when pregnant women get the disease.</p><p>Mumps is an infection that can cause serious problems, such as encephalitis and meningitis, which affect the brain. In addition, adolescent boys and men are very susceptible to a condition called orchitis, which causes pain and swelling in the testicles and scrotum and, in rare cases, sterility. Also, mumps infection can cause spontaneous abortion in women during the first 3 months of pregnancy.</p><p>While immunization against rubella and mumps is recommended for all persons 12 months of age and older, it is especially important for women of childbearing age and persons traveling outside the U.S.</p><p>If rubella and mumps virus vaccine live is to be given to a child, the child should be at least 12 months of age. This is to make sure the vaccine is effective. In a child less than 12 months of age, antibodies from the mother may prevent the vaccine from working.</p><p>This vaccine is to be administered only by or under the supervision of your doctor or other health care professional.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using rubella and mumps virus vaccine live</h2><p>In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do.
