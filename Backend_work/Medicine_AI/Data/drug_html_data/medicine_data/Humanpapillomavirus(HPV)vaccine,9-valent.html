A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>HPV 9-valent vaccine is given in a series of 2 or 3 shots. You may have the first shot at any time as long as you are between the ages of 9 and 45 years old. The second dose is given 2 to 6 months after your first shot.

The next dose should be given as soon as possible. There is no need to start over.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of this vaccine is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid before or after receiving HPV 9-valent vaccine?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">HPV 9-valent vaccine side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving this vaccine.

Your doctor may want you to remain under observation during the first 15 minutes after the injection.</p><p>Developing cancer from HPV is much more dangerous to your health than receiving the vaccine to protect against it.
