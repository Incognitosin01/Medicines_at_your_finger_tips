</ul><h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2><p class="First">CILOXAN<span class="Sup">®</span> (ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution) is a synthetic, sterile, multiple dose, antimicrobial for topical ophthalmic use. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial active against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative ocular pathogens. It is available as the monohydrochloride monohydrate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-3-quinoline-carboxylic acid. It is a faint to light yellow crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 385.8. Its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">18</span>FN<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>•HCl•H<span class="Sub">2</span>O and its chemical structure is as follows:</p><p>Ciprofloxacin differs from other quinolones in that it has a fluorine atom at the 6-position, a piperazine moiety at the 7-position, and a cyclopropyl ring at the 1-position.</p><p><span class="Bold">Each mL of CILOXAN<span class="Sup">®</span> (ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution) 0.3% contains: Active:</span> ciprofloxacin HCl 3.5 mg equivalent to 3 mg base. <span class="Bold">Preservative:</span> benzalkonium chloride 0.006%. <span class="Bold">Inactives:</span> sodium acetate, acetic acid, mannitol 4.6%, edetate disodium 0.05%, hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide (to adjust pH) and purified water. The pH is approximately 4.5 and the osmolality is approximately 300 mOsm.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Systemic Absorption:</span> A systemic absorption study was performed in which CILOXAN<span class="Sup">®</span> (ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution) 0.3% was administered in each eye every two hours while awake for two days followed by every four hours while awake for an additional 5 days. The maximum reported plasma concentration of ciprofloxacin was less than 5 ng/mL. The mean concentration was usually less than 2.5 ng/mL.</p><p><span class="Bold">Microbiology:</span> Ciprofloxacin has <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase which is needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA.</p><p>Ciprofloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).</p><p><span class="Bold">Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (methicillin-susceptible strains)</p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> (methicillin-susceptible strains)</p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus</span> (Viridans Group)</p><p><span class="Bold">Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Serratia marcescens</span></p><p>Ciprofloxacin has been shown to be active <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> against most strains of the following organisms, however, <span class="Italics">the clinical significance of these data is unknown</span>:</p><p><span class="Bold">Gram-Positive:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Enterococcus faecalis</span> (Many strains are only moderately susceptible)</p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus haemolyticus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus hominis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus saprophyticus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Gram-Negative:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subsp. anitratus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Aeromonas caviae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Aeromonas hydrophila</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Brucella melitensis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Campylobacter coli</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Campylobacter jejuni</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Citrobacter diversus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Citrobacter freundii</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Edwardsiella tarda</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Enterobacter aerogenes</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Enterobacter cloacae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus ducreyi</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus parainfluenzae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Kiebsiella pneumoniae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Klebsiella oxytoca</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Legionella pneumophila</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Morganella morganii</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Neisseria meningitidis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pasteurella multocida</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Proteus mirabilis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Proteus vulgaris</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Providencia rettgeri</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Providencia stuartii</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Salmonella enteritidis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Salmonella typhi</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Shigella sonneii</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Shigella flexneri</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Vibrio cholerae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Vibrio parahaemolyticus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Vibrio vulnificus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Yersinia enterocolitica</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Other Organisms:</span> <span class="Italics">Chlamydia trachomatis</span> (only moderately susceptible) and <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span> (only moderately susceptible).</p><p>Most strains of <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas cepacia</span> and some strains of <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas maltophilia</span> are resistant to ciprofloxacin as are most anaerobic bacteria, including <span class="Italics">Bacteroides fragilis</span> and <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>.</p><p>The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) generally does not exceed the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) by more than a factor of 2. Resistance to ciprofloxacin <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> usually develops slowly (multiple-step mutation).</p><p>Ciprofloxacin does not cross-react with other antimicrobial agents such as beta-lactams or aminoglycosides; therefore, organisms resistant to these drugs may be susceptible to ciprofloxacin.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First">Ciloxan Ophthalmic Solution is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below:</p><p><span class="Bold">Corneal Ulcers:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Serratia marcescens *</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus</span> (Viridans Group)*</p><p><span class="Bold">Conjunctivitis:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span></p><p>*Efficacy for this organism was studied in fewer than 10 infections.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">A history of hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin or any other component of the medication is a contraindication to its use. A history of hypersensitivity to other quinolones may also contraindicate the use of ciprofloxacin.</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First">NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE.</p><p>Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving systemic quinolone therapy. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Only a few patients had a history of hypersensitivity reactions. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitation measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, intravenous antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines and airway management, as clinically indicated.</p><p>Remove contact lenses before using.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> As with other antibacterial preparations, prolonged use of ciprofloxacin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Whenever clinical judgment dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining.</p><p>Ciprofloxacin should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity reaction.</p><p>In clinical studies of patients with bacterial corneal ulcer, a white crystalline precipitate located in the superficial portion of the corneal defect was observed in 35 (16.6%) of 210 patients. The onset of the precipitate was within 24 hours to 7 days after starting therapy. In one patient, the precipitate was immediately irrigated out upon its appearance. In 17 patients, resolution of the precipitate was seen in 1 to 8 days (seven within the first 24 to 72 hours), in five patients, resolution was noted in 10 to 13 days. In nine patients, exact resolution days were unavailable; however, at follow-up examinations, 18 to 44 days after onset of the event, complete resolution of the precipitate was noted. In three patients, outcome information was unavailable. The precipitate did not preclude continued use of ciprofloxacin, nor did it adversely affect the clinical course of the ulcer or visual outcome (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Information for patients:</span> Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the solution.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span> Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with ophthalmic ciprofloxacin. However, the systemic administration of some quinolones has been shown to elevate plasma concentrations of theophylline, interfere with the metabolism of caffeine, enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant, warfarin, and its derivatives, and has been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine concomitantly.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span> Eight <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mutagenicity tests have been conducted with ciprofloxacin and the test results are listed below:</p><ul>
<li><span class="Italics">Salmonella</span>/Microsome Test (Negative)</li>
<li><span class="Italics">E. coli</span> DNA Repair Assay (Negative)</li>
<li>Mouse Lymphoma Cell Forward Mutation Assay (Positive)</li>
<li>Chinese Hamster V<span class="Sub">79</span> Cell HGPRT Test (Negative)</li>
<li>Syrian Hamster Embryo Cell Transformation Assay (Negative)</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> Point Mutation Assay (Negative)</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> Mitotic Crossover and Gene Conversion Assay (Negative)</li>
<li>Rat Hepatocyte DNA Repair Assay (Positive)</li>
</ul><p>Thus, two of the eight tests were positive, but the results of the following three <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> test systems gave negative results:</p><ul>
<li>Rat Hepatocyte DNA Repair Assay</li>
<li>Micronucleus Test (Mice)</li>
<li>Dominant Lethal Test (Mice)</li>
</ul><p>Long term carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been completed. After daily oral dosing for up to two years, there is no evidence that ciprofloxacin had any carcinogenic or tumorigenic effects in these species.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy:</span> Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and mice at doses up to six times the usual daily human oral dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ciprofloxacin. In rabbits, as with most antimicrobial agents, ciprofloxacin (30 and 100 mg/kg orally) produced gastrointestinal disturbances resulting in maternal weight loss and an increased incidence of abortion. No teratogenicity was observed at either dose. After intravenous administration, at doses up to 20 mg/kg, no maternal toxicity was produced and no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. CILOXAN<span class="Sup">®</span> (ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution) 0.3% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> It is not known whether topically applied ciprofloxacin is excreted in human milk; however, it is known that orally administered ciprofloxacin is excreted in the milk of lactating rats and oral ciprofloxacin has been reported in human breast milk after a single 500 mg dose. Caution should be exercised when CILOXAN<span class="Sup">®</span> (ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution) 0.3% is administered to a nursing mother.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> The safety and effectiveness of CILOXAN<span class="Sup">®</span> (ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution) 0.3% have been established in all ages. Use of CILOXAN is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of CILOXAN in adults, children and neonates (see Clinical Studies). Although ciprofloxacin and other quinolones cause arthropathy in immature animals after oral administration, topical ocular administration of ciprofloxacin to immature animals did not cause any arthropathy and there is no evidence that the ophthalmic dosage form has any effect on the weight bearing joints.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use:</span> No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">The most frequently reported drug related adverse reaction was local burning or discomfort. In corneal ulcer studies with frequent administration of the drug, white crystalline precipitates were seen in approximately 17% of patients (see PRECAUTIONS). Other reactions occurring in less than 10% of patients included lid margin crusting, crystals/scales, foreign body sensation, itching, conjunctival hyperemia and a bad taste following instillation. Additional events occurring in less than 1% of patients included corneal staining, keratopathy/keratitis, allergic reactions, lid edema, tearing, photophobia, corneal infiltrates, nausea and decreased vision.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First">A topical overdose of CILOXAN<span class="Sup">®</span> (ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution) 0.3% may be flushed from the eye(s) with warm tap water.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Corneal Ulcers:</span> The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of <span class="Bold">corneal ulcers</span> is two drops into the affected eye every 15 minutes for the first six hours and then two drops into the affected eye every 30 minutes for the remainder of the first day. On the second day, instill two drops in the affected eye hourly. On the third through the fourteenth day, place two drops in the affected eye every four hours. Treatment may be continued after 14 days if corneal re-epithelialization has not occurred.</p><p><span class="Bold">Bacterial Conjunctivitis:</span> The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of <span class="Bold">bacterial conjunctivitis</span> is one or two drops instilled into the conjunctival sac(s) every two hours while awake for two days and one or two drops every four hours while awake for the next five days.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">How Supplied:</span> As a sterile ophthalmic solution in Alcon's DROP-TAINER<span class="Sup">®</span> dispensing system consisting of a natural low density polyethylene bottle and dispensing plug and tan polypropylene closure. Tamper evidence is provided with a shrink band around the closure and neck area of the package.</p><p>5 mL in 8 mL bottle -                                                             <span class="Bold">NDC</span> 0065-0656-05</p><p><span class="Bold">Storage:</span> Store at 2°C to 25°C (36°F-77°F). Protect from light.</p><h2>ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin and related drugs have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals of most species tested following oral administration. However, a one-month topical ocular study using immature Beagle dogs did not demonstrate any articular lesions.</p><h2>CLINICAL STUDIES:</h2><p class="First">Following therapy with CILOXAN<span class="Sup">®</span> (ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution) 0.3%, 76% of the patients with corneal ulcers and positive bacterial cultures were clinically cured and complete re-epithelialization occurred in about 92% of the ulcers.</p><p>In 3 and 7 day multicenter clinical trials, 52% of the patients with conjunctivitis and positive conjunctival cultures were clinically cured and 70%-80% had all causative pathogens eradicated by the end of treatment.</p><p>In a randomized, double-masked, multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial of pediatric patients with bacterial conjunctivitis, between birth and 31 days of age, patients were dosed with CILOXAN or another anti-infective agent. Clinical outcomes for the trial demonstrated a clinical cure rate of 80% at Day 9 and a microbiological eradication success rate of 85% at Day 9.</p><p>Please note that microbiologic eradication does not always correlate with clinical outcome in anti-infective trials.</p><p>©2003, 2004, 2006, 2016, 2018 Novartis</p><p><span class="Bold">Distributed by:</span><br/>
