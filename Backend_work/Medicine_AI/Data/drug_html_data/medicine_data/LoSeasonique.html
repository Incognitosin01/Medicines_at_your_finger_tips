This medication also causes changes in your cervical mucus and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus.</p><p>LoSeasonique is used as contraception to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>LoSeasonique may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use LoSeasonique if you are pregnant or if you have recently had a baby.</b></p><p>You should not take LoSeasonique if you have any of the following conditions: uncontrolled high blood pressure, heart disease, a blood-clotting disorder, circulation problems, diabetic problems with your eyes or kidneys, unusual vaginal bleeding, liver disease or liver cancer, severe migraine headaches, if you smoke and are over 35, or if you have ever had breast or uterine cancer, jaundice caused by birth control pills, a heart attack, a stroke, or a blood clot.</p><p>Taking LoSeasonique can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack, especially if you have certain other conditions, or if you are overweight.</p><p><b>Smoking can greatly increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</b> You should not take this medicine if you smoke and are over 35 years old.</p><p>Missing a pill increases your risk of becoming pregnant.

You may get pregnant if you do not take one pill daily. Get your prescription refilled before you run out of pills completely.</p><p>You will not have a menstrual period every month while you are taking an extended-cycle birth control pill. Instead, your period should occur every 12 weeks.</p><p>The 91-day LoSeasonique pack contains three trays with cards that hold 84 "active" pills and seven "reminder" pills. You must use the pills in a certain order to keep you on a regular cycle. Trays 1 and 2 each hold 28 pills. Tray 3 holds 35 pills, including the 7 reminder pills.

Then take one pill per day for the rest of the pack.</p><p>If you miss two "active" pills in a row, take two pills per day for two days in a row. Then take one pill per day for the rest of the pack.

Use back-up birth control for at least the next 7 days.</p><p>If you miss any reminder pills, throw them away and keep taking one pill per day until the pack is empty.
