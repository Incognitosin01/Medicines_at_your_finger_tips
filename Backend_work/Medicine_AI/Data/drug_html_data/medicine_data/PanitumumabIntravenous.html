Panitumumab injection should only be used in patients who have a wild type RAS (in both KRAS and NRAS) gene mutation test. This test helps the doctor decide whether the medicine will treat their cancer.</p><p>Panitumumab interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by panitumumab, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, such as a skin rash, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects do not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.</p><p>Before you begin treatment with panitumumab, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits of panitumumab as well as the risks of using it.</p><p>Panitumumab will only be given by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using panitumumab</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For panitumumab, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to panitumumab or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of panitumumab injection in children. However, safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of panitumumab injection in the elderly. However, some elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted side effects (eg, diarrhea), which may require caution in patients receiving panitumumab.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving panitumumab, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using panitumumab with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>
<li>Tofacitinib</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of panitumumab.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of panitumumab</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you panitumumab in a hospital or cancer treatment center. Panitumumab is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. Panitumumab needs to be given slowly, so the needle will have to remain in place for at least an hour.</p><p>Panitumumab sometimes causes nausea and vomiting. However, it is very important that you continue to receive the medicine, even if you begin to feel ill. Ask your doctor for ways to lessen these effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using panitumumab</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that panitumumab is working properly.
