Closely monitor hepatic function with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue antiretroviral treatment. If appropriate, initiation of anti-HBV therapy may be warranted.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiac effects: In healthy subjects, supratherapeutic dosages of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram; use caution when coadministering with drugs with a known risk of torsades de pointes.</p><p>• Decreased bone mineral density: In clinical trials, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has been associated with decreases in bone mineral density in HIV-1 infected adults and increases in bone metabolism markers. Serum parathyroid hormone and 1,25 vitamin D levels were also higher. Decreases in bone mineral density have also been observed in clinical trials of HIV-1 infected pediatric patients. Observations in chronic hepatitis B infected pediatric patients (aged 12 to 18 years) were similar. In all pediatric clinical trials, skeletal growth (height) appears unaffected. Consider monitoring of bone density in adult and pediatric patients with a history of pathologic fractures or with other risk factors for bone loss or osteoporosis. Consider calcium and vitamin D supplementation for all patients; effect of supplementation has not been studied but may be beneficial. Long-term bone health and fracture risk unknown. If abnormalities are suspected, expert assessment is recommended.</p><p>• Depressive disorders: Rilpivirine may cause depression, depressed mood, dysphoria, major depression, mood changes, negative thoughts, suicide attempts, or suicidal ideation. Promptly evaluate patients with severe depressive symptoms and reevaluate risk versus benefit of continued combination therapy.</p><p>• Hepatotoxicity: Hepatotoxicity has been reported with rilpivirine-containing regimens. Patients with hepatitis B or C or increased baseline liver function tests may be at greater risk, although some cases have occurred in patients with no preexisting disease or hepatic disease risk factors. Evaluate liver function tests in patients with increased baseline liver function tests or with hepatitis B or C prior to treatment initiation and periodically during therapy; also consider evaluation of patients with no preexisting hepatic disease or hepatic disease risk factors.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity and severe skin reactions have been reported, including severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, blisters, mucosal involvement, conjunctivitis, facial edema, angioedema, hepatitis or eosinophilia, or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) with regimens containing rilpivirine. Some skin reactions were accompanied by constitutional symptoms (eg, fever); other skin reactions were associated with organ dysfunction (eg, hepatic serum biochemistry elevations). In clinical trials, treatment-related rashes ≥ grade 2 were reported in 1% of patients. Most rashes were Grade 1 or 2 and occurred within the first 4 to 6 weeks of therapy. Monitor laboratory parameters and clinical status; discontinue if any severe hypersensitivity or skin rash develop.</p><p>• Immune reconstitution syndrome: Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome resulting in the occurrence of an inflammatory response to an indolent or residual opportunistic infection during initial HIV treatment or activation of autoimmune disorders (eg, Graves disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome) later in therapy; further evaluation and treatment may be required.</p><p>• Lactic acidosis/hepatomegaly: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, sometimes fatal, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Suspend treatment in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (marked transaminase elevation may/may not accompany hepatomegaly and steatosis).</p><p>• Osteomalacia and renal dysfunction: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may cause osteomalacia with proximal renal tubulopathy. Bone pain, extremity pain, fractures, arthralgias, weakness, and muscle pain have been reported. In patients at risk for renal dysfunction, persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms should be evaluated for hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia.</p><p>• Renal toxicity: May cause renal toxicity (acute renal failure and/or Fanconi syndrome); avoid use with concurrent or recent nephrotoxic therapy (including high dose or multiple NSAID use). Acute renal failure has occurred in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal impairment who were on a stable tenofovir disoproxil fumarate regimen to which a high dose or multiple NSAID therapy was added. Consider alternatives to NSAIDS in patients taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and at risk for renal impairment. Assess serum creatinine, estimated CrCl, urine protein, and urine glucose prior to initiation of therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy. Monitor serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease. IDSA guidelines recommend discontinuing tenofovir (and substituting with alternative antiretroviral therapy) in HIV-infected patients who develop a decline in GFR (a &gt;25% decrease in GFR from baseline and to a level of &lt;60 mL/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) during use, particularly in presence of proximal tubular dysfunction (eg, euglycemic glycosuria, increased urinary phosphorus excretion and hypophosphatemia, proteinuria [new onset or worsening]) (IDSA [Lucas 2014]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Chronic hepatitis B: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Safety and efficacy during coinfection of HIV-1 and HBV have not been established; acute, severe exacerbations of HBV have been reported following discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy.

If used as therapy replacement in virologically suppressed patients meeting criteria, additional HIV-1 RNA and regimen tolerability monitoring is recommended to assess potential virologic failure or rebound.</p><p>Patients with HIV and HBV coinfection should be monitored for several months following tenofovir discontinuation.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>The Health and Human Services (HHS) perinatal HIV guidelines consider this fixed-dose combination an alternative regimen for females living with HIV who are not yet pregnant but are trying to conceive (HHS [perinatal] 2019).</p><p>Refer to individual monographs for additional information.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>The Health and Human Services (HHS) perinatal HIV guidelines recommend this fixed-dose combination an alternative regimen for initial use in pregnant females living with HIV who are antiretroviral naive, who have had antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the past but are restarting, or who require a new ART regimen (due to poor tolerance or poor virologic response of current regimen). Females who become pregnant while taking this combination may continue if viral suppression is effective and the regimen is well tolerated. More frequent monitoring is recommended during pregnancy.
