Antiarrhythmic Agents (Class III) may increase the serum concentration of Lidocaine (Topical). This mechanism specifically applies to amiodarone and dronedarone. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Aprepitant: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Beta-Blockers: May increase the serum concentration of Lidocaine (Topical).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Bupivacaine: Local Anesthetics may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Bupivacaine.  Management: Avoid using any additional local anesthetics within 96 hours after insertion of the bupivacaine implant (Xaracoll).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Clofazimine: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Conivaptan: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Moderate): May decrease the metabolism of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Strong): May decrease the metabolism of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors). Management: Consider avoiding this combination. Some combinations are specifically contraindicated by manufacturers; others may have recommended dose adjustments. If combined, monitor for increased substrate effects.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Dapsone (Topical): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Dichlorphenamide: Laxatives may enhance the hypokalemic effect of Dichlorphenamide. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Disopyramide: May enhance the arrhythmogenic effect of Lidocaine (Topical). Disopyramide may increase the serum concentration of Lidocaine (Topical). Specifically, the unbound/free fraction of lidocaine.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Duvelisib: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Erdafitinib: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Fosaprepitant: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Fosnetupitant: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Fusidic Acid (Systemic): May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Idelalisib: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Larotrectinib: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Local Anesthetics: Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Local Anesthetics.

Specifically, the risk for methemoglobinemia may be increased.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>MiFEPRIStone: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors). Management: Minimize doses of CYP3A4 substrates, and monitor for increased concentrations/toxicity, during and 2 weeks following treatment with mifepristone. Avoid cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Netupitant: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Nitric Oxide: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents.

Combinations of these agents may increase the likelihood of significant methemoglobinemia.  Management: Monitor patients for signs of methemoglobinemia (e.g., hypoxia, cyanosis) when prilocaine is used in combination with other agents associated with development of methemoglobinemia.  Avoid lidocaine/prilocaine in infants receiving such agents.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Simeprevir: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Sodium Nitrite: Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Sodium Nitrite.

Management: Use of stiripentol with CYP3A4 substrates that are considered to have a narrow therapeutic index should be avoided due to the increased risk for adverse effects and toxicity.  Any CYP3A4 substrate used with stiripentol requires closer monitoring.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><h2>Test Interactions</h2><p>See individual agents.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Also see individual agents.

Onset may be immediate or delayed (hours) after anesthetic exposure. Patients with G6PD deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites, or infants &lt;6 months of age are more susceptible and should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia (eg, cyanosis, headache, rapid pulse, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, fatigue).</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• Self-medication (OTC use): When used for self-medication, discontinue use and notify health care provider if rectal bleeding occurs; an allergic reaction develops; or if condition worsens, does not improve within 7 days, the symptoms being treated does not subside, or if redness, irritation, swelling, pain, or other symptoms develop or increase..</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Refer to individual monographs.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat signs of hemorrhoids or rectal irritation.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
