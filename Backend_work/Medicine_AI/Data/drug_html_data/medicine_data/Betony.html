It is distributed widely throughout western and southern Europe. It has a rosette of hairy leaves and a dense terminal spike of pink, white, or purple flowers that bloom from June to September. The plant reaches a height of 1 m, and the aboveground parts are dried and used medicinally. It is native to Europe and is often cultivated as a garden ornamental.Duke 1989, USDA 2014 S. lavandulifolia is used commonly in Iran.Jalilian 2013</p><h2>History</h2><p>The use of betony has been known since the ancient Roman Empire, during which it was considered a panacea for a wide variety of diseases. In the Middle Ages, the plant was ascribed magical powers and continues to be used in traditional medicine today. A weak infusion is sometimes taken as a tea, and it is also used as an astringent to treat diarrhea and as a gargle or tea for irritations of the mouth and throat. It has been used to treat anxiety and has been given as a tincture or smoked for the treatment of headaches. The name "betony" may be derived from the Celtic form of <i>bew</i> (a head) and <i>ton</i> (good).Chevallier 1996, Duke 1989</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Betony contains about 15% tannins, which account for its astringency. It also contains stachydrine, oxystachydrine, caffeoylquinic, caffeic, chlorogenic and rosmarinic acids, achillein, betaine, betonicin, choline, harpagide, and turicine. A report lists 6 phenylethanoid glycosides from the aerial parts of the plant. Sesquiterpenes, flavonoids, and hydrocarbons have been identified.Duke 1989, Lazarević 2013, Miyase 1996</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>Experimental or clinical studies to support the many traditional uses ascribed to betony are limited.</p><h3>Anti-inflammatory</h3><p>Extracts of the aerial plant parts showed anti-inflammatory activity in the carrageenan paw edema model in rats.Háznagy-Radnai 2012</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the potential anti-inflammatory effects of betony.</p><h3>Antimicrobial</h3><p>In vitro studies suggest the essential oil of S. officinalis may have antifungal efficacy against Aspergillus and Candida albicans.Lazarević 2013</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of betony as an antimicrobial agent.</p><h3>Antioxidant activity</h3><p>Depending on the extraction method, S. officinalis demonstrated significant antioxidant properties including in a lipid peroxidation assay.Matkowski 2006</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of betony for its potential antioxidant properties.</p><h3>Endocrine</h3><p>The effect of S. lavandulifolia was compared with medroxyprogesterone for its effect on abnormal uterine bleeding in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in a 3-month randomized, controlled trial (n=66). Women were randomized to either 10 days of medroxyprogesterone (10 mg/day on days 14 to 24 of 3 consecutive cycles) or daily tea from the aerial parts of wood betony (5 g per 100 mL 3 times daily starting on day 1 of the first cycle and continuing through the last day of the 3<sup>rd</sup> cycle). Both wood betony tea and medroxyprogesterone significantly improved abnormal uterine bleeding symptoms with an age-adjusted reduction in prevalence rates of −1.8 and −1.6, respectively (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001 for each). Wood betony was not inferior to medroxyprogesterone, as the difference in magnitude of effect between them was not significant. However, the reduction in abnormal sonographic findings was significantly better with wood betony (−51.5) compared to medroxyprogesterone (−9.1; <i>P</i>=0.036). Although no statistically significant difference was observed in adverse effects between the 2 treatment groups, approximately 9.1% of women in the wood betony group developed amenorrhea after the 3-month treatment period, whereas the incidence at baseline was 0%.Jalilian 2013</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>There is no recent clinical evidence to guide dosage of betony. Traditional instructions include 1 to 2 g of the herb per day in 3 divided doses and 1 ounce of the herb per pint of boiling water.Duke 1989 Aerial wood betony tea at a dose of 5 g per 100 mL 3 times daily for 3 months was found to be as effective as medroxyprogesterone in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.Jalilian 2013</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use; documented adverse effects.Chevallier 1996</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Information regarding adverse reactions with the use of this product is limited. Dyspepsia is the only reported adverse effect that has been associated with the Stachys genus.Jalilian 2013</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Although there is little documented evidence of betony toxicity, overdosage may cause GI irritation because of the tannin content.Chevallier 1996 Betony polyphenols were found to be toxic in animals.Lipkan 1974</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
