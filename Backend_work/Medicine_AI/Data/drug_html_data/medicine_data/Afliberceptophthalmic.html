It works by keeping new blood vessels from forming under the retina (a sensory membrane that lines the inside of the eye). In people with a certain type of eye disease, new blood vessels grow under the retina where they leak blood and fluid. This is known as the "wet form" of macular degeneration.</p><p>Aflibercept ophthalmic (for the eyes) is used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration. Aflibercept is also used to treat swelling in the retina caused by a blockage in the blood vessels.</p><p>Aflibercept ophthalmic is also used to treat diabetic retinopathy, an eye disorder in diabetics that can lead to a buildup of fluid in the retina and cause blindness.</p><p>Aflibercept ophthalmic may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use aflibercept if you have swelling inside your eyes, or any type of infection in or around your eyes.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have eye pain or redness, swelling or puffiness around your eyes, or sudden vision problems at any time during treatment.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use aflibercept if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p><ul>
