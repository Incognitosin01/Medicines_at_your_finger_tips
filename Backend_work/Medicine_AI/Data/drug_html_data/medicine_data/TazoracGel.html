</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Tazorac Gel</h2><h3>1.1 Plaque Psoriasis</h3><p class="First">TAZORAC® (tazarotene) Gel, 0.05% and 0.1% are indicated for the topical treatment of patients with plaque psoriasis of up to 20% body surface area involvement.</p><h3>1.2 Acne Vulgaris</h3><p class="First">TAZORAC (tazarotene) Gel, 0.1% is also indicated for the topical treatment of patients with facial acne vulgaris of mild to moderate severity.</p><p>The efficacy of Tazorac Gel in the treatment of acne previously treated with other retinoids or resistant to oral antibiotics has not been established.</p><h3>1.3 Limitations of Use</h3><p class="First">The safety of Tazorac Gel use on more than 20% body surface area has not been established in psoriasis or acne <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.1</span><span class="Italics">) and Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.1</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h2>Tazorac Gel Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Tazorac Gel is for topical use only. Tazorac Gel is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. Avoid accidental transfer of Tazorac Gel into eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes. If contact with mucous membranes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.2</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p>Wash hands thoroughly after application.</p><h3>2.1 Psoriasis</h3><p class="First">It is recommended that treatment starts with Tazorac Gel, 0.05%, with strength increased to 0.1% if tolerated and medically indicated. Apply a thin film (2 mg/cm<span class="Sup">2</span>) of Tazorac Gel once per day, in the evening, to cover only the psoriatic lesions on no more than 20% of body surface area. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the gel. If emollients are used, they should be applied at least an hour before application of Tazorac Gel. Because unaffected skin may be more susceptible to irritation, application of tazarotene to these areas should be carefully avoided. Tazorac Gel was investigated for up to 12 months during clinical trials for psoriasis.</p><h3>2.2 Acne</h3><p class="First">Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer (2 mg/cm<span class="Sup">2</span>) of Tazorac Gel 0.1% once per day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affected area. Tazorac Gel was investigated for up to 12 weeks during clinical trials for acne.</p><p>Use effective sunscreens and wear protective clothing while using Tazorac Gel <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.3</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Gel, 0.05% and 0.1%, in 30 g and 100 g tubes. Each gram of Tazorac Gel, 0.05% and 0.1% contains 0.5 mg and 1 mg of tazarotene, respectively in a translucent, aqueous gel.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Tazorac Gel is contraindicated in: </p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Pregnancy. Retinoids may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.1</span><span class="Italics">), Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.1</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">8.3</span><span class="Italics">)].</span><br/></li>
<li>Individuals who have known hypersensitivity to any of its components <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.2</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology and the potential for systemic absorption, Tazorac Gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Tazarotene elicits malformations and developmental effects associated with retinoids after topical and oral administration to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis.</p><p>Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in orally treated animals.</p><p>Although there may be less systemic exposure in the treatment of acne of the face alone due to less surface area for application, tazarotene is a teratogenic substance and causes fetal malformations in animals, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12.3</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p>There were thirteen reported pregnancies in subjects who participated in the clinical trials for topical tazarotene. Nine of the subjects had been treated with topical tazarotene, and the other four had been treated with vehicle. One of the subjects who was treated with tazarotene cream  elected to terminate the pregnancy for non-medical reasons unrelated to treatment. The other eight pregnant women who were inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during the clinical trials subsequently delivered apparently healthy babies. As the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation times are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown.</p><p><span class="Italics">Females of Child-bearing Potential</span></p><p>Females of child-bearing potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when Tazorac Gel is used. The possibility that a female of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered.</p><p>A negative result for pregnancy test should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to Tazorac Gel therapy. Tazorac Gel therapy should begin during a normal menstrual period <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.1</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>5.2 Local Irritation and Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Application of Tazorac Gel may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive individuals. Local reactions (including blistering and skin desquamation, pruritus, burning, erythema) and hypersensitivity adverse reactions (including urticaria) have been observed with topical tazarotene.</p><p>If these adverse reactions occur, consider discontinuing the medication or reducing the dosing frequency, as appropriate, until the integrity of the skin is restored.  Alternatively, patients with psoriasis who are being treated with the 0.1% concentration can be switched to the lower concentration. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance.  Therapy can be resumed, or the drug concentration or frequency of application can be increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate treatment.</p><p>Concomitant topical medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to "rest" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before treatment with Tazorac Gel is initiated.</p><p>Tazorac Gel, should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation.</p><p>Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using Tazorac Gel.</p><h3>5.3 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn</h3><p class="First">Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of Tazorac Gel. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using Tazorac Gel. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use Tazorac Gel until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using Tazorac Gel.</p><p>Tazorac Gel should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><p>•       Embryofetal toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span></p><p>•       Photosensitivity and Risk of Sunburn <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.3</span><span class="Italics">)]</span></p><h3>6.1 Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Psoriasis</span></p><p>A total of 439 subjects 14 to 87 years of age were treated with Tazorac Gel, 0.05% and 0.1% in two controlled clinical trials. The most frequent adverse events reported with Tazorac Gel, 0.05% and 0.1% occurring in 10 to 30% of subjects, in descending order, included pruritus, burning/stinging, erythema, worsening of psoriasis, irritation, and skin pain. Reactions occurring in 1 to 10% of subjects included rash, desquamation, irritant contact dermatitis, skin inflammation, fissuring, bleeding, and dry skin. Increases in “psoriasis worsening” and “sun-induced erythema” were noted in some subjects over the 4th to 12th months of treatment as compared to the first three months of a 1 year study. In general, the incidence of adverse events with Tazorac Gel 0.05% was 2 to 5% lower than that seen with Tazorac Gel 0.1%.</p><p><span class="Bold">Acne</span></p><p>A total of 596 subjects 12 to 44 years of age were treated with Tazorac Gel, 0.05% and 0.1% in two controlled clinical trials. The most frequent adverse events reported during clinical trials with Tazorac Gel, 0.1% in the treatment of acne occurring in 10 to 30% of subjects, in descending order, included desquamation, burning/stinging, dry skin, erythema and pruritus. Reactions occurring in 1 to 10% of subjects included irritation, skin pain, fissuring, localized edema and skin discoloration.</p><h3>6.2 Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tazarotene.</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders</span>: blister, dermatitis, urticaria, skin exfoliation, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), swelling at or near application sites, and pain.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Tazorac Gel.</p><p>In a trial of 27 healthy female subjects between the ages of 20–55 years receiving a combination oral contraceptive tablet containing 1 mg norethindrone and 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol, concomitant use of tazarotene administered as 1.1 mg orally (mean ± SD C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> of tazarotenic acid were 28.9 ± 9.4 ng/mL and 120.6 ± 28.5 ng•hr/mL, respectively) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol over a complete cycle.</p><p>The impact of tazarotene on the pharmacokinetics of progestin only oral contraceptives (i.e., minipills) has not been evaluated.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>8.1 Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, Tazorac Gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from Tazorac Gel during pregnancy; therefore, Tazorac Gel should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">), Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.1</span><span class="Italics">), Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12.3</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Limited case reports of pregnancy in females enrolled in clinical trials for Tazorac Gel have not established a clear association with tazarotene and major birth defects or miscarriage risk. Because the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestational age are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed topically during organogenesis at 0.5 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of tazarotene gel, 0.1% resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits dosed topically with tazarotene gel at 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, there were single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, tazarotene dosed orally during organogenesis at 0.5 and 13 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% resulted in malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays. In pregnant rats, tazarotene dosed orally prior to mating through early gestation resulted in decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations at doses approximately 2 times higher than the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>.</p><p>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In rats, a tazarotene gel, 0.05% formulation dosed topically during gestation days 6 through 17 at 0.25 mg/kg/day, which represented 0.5 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% (i.e., 2 mg/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> over a 20% body surface area), resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification. Rabbits dosed topically with 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene gel, which represented 7 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, during gestation days 6 through 18 were noted with single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies.</p><p>When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats, and malformations and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing 0.5 and 13 times, respectively, the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%.</p><p>In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, which represented 2 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%, classic developmental effects of retinoids were observed including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights. A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at that dose.</p><p>In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of tazarotene gel (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival, but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the maximum systemic exposure in the rat would be 0.3 times the maximum systemic exposure in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%.</p><h3>8.2 Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of tazarotene in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. After single topical doses of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-tazarotene gel to the skin of lactating rats, radioactivity was detected in rat milk. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of Tazorac Gel to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Tazorac Gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tazorac Gel or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Testing</span></p><p>Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within 2 weeks prior to initiating Tazorac Gel therapy which should begin during a menstrual period.</p><p><span class="Bold">Contraception</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Females</span></p><p>Based on animal studies, Tazorac Gel may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Tazorac Gel.  </p><h3>8.4 Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of Tazorac Gel have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriasis or acne under the age of 12 years.</p><h3>8.5 Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials of Tazorac Gel for plaque psoriasis, 163 were over the age of 65. Subjects over 65 years of age experienced more adverse events and lower treatment success rates after 12 weeks of use of Tazorac Gel compared with those 65 years of age and younger. Currently there is no other clinical experience on the differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Tazarotene gel for the treatment of acne has not been clinically evaluated in persons over the age of 65.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Excessive topical use of Tazorac Gel, 0.05% and 0.1% may lead to marked redness, peeling, or discomfort <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.2</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p>Tazorac Gel 0.05% and 0.1% are not for oral use. Oral ingestion of the drug may lead to the same adverse effects as those associated with excessive oral intake of Vitamin A (hypervitaminosis A) or other retinoids. If oral ingestion occurs, the patient should be monitored, and appropriate supportive measures should be administered as necessary.</p><h2>Tazorac Gel Description</h2><p class="First">TAZORAC<span class="Bold"> </span>(tazarotene) Gel, 0.05% and 0.1% is for topical use and contains the active ingredient, tazarotene. Each gram of Tazorac Gel, 0.05% and 0.1% contains 0.5 and 1 mg of tazarotene, respectively in a translucent, aqueous gel. </p><p>Tazarotene is a member of the acetylenic class of retinoids. Chemically, tazarotene is ethyl 6-[(4,4-dimethylthiochroman-6-yl)ethynyl]nicotinate. The compound has an empirical formula of C21H21NO2S and molecular weight of 351.46. The structural formula is shown below:</p><p></p><p>Tazorac Gel contains the following inactive ingredients:</p><p>benzyl alcohol 1%;ascorbic acid; butylated hydroxyanisole; butylated hydroxytoluene; carbomer homopolymer type B; edetate disodium; hexylene glycol; poloxamer 407; polyethylene glycol 400; polysorbate 40; purified water; and tromethamine.</p><h2>Tazorac Gel - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RARα, RARβ, and RARγ, but shows relative selectivity for RARβ, and RARγ and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and facial acne vulgaris is unknown.</p><h3>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacodynamics of Tazorac Gel in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and facial acne vulgaris are unknown.</p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Little parent compound could be detected in the plasma. Tazarotenic acid was highly bound to plasma proteins (greater than 99%).</p><p>Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid were metabolized to sulfoxides, sulfones and other polar metabolites which were eliminated through urinary and fecal pathways. The half-life of tazarotenic acid was approximately 18 hours, following topical application of tazarotene to normal, acne or psoriatic skin.</p><p>The human <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> studies described below were conducted with tazarotene gel applied topically at approximately 2 mg/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> and left on the skin for 10 to 12 hours. Both the peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) refer to the active metabolite only.</p><p>Two single, topical dose studies were conducted using <span class="Sup">14</span>C-tazarotene gel. Systemic absorption, as determined from radioactivity in the excreta, was less than 1% of the applied dose (without occlusion) in six subjects with psoriasis and approximately 5% of the applied dose (under occlusion) in six healthy subjects. One non-radiolabeled single-dose study comparing the 0.05% gel to the 0.1% gel in healthy subjects indicated that the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC were 40% higher for the 0.1% gel.</p><p>After 7 days of topical dosing with measured doses of tazarotene 0.1% gel on 20% of the total body surface without occlusion in 24 healthy subjects, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> for tazarotenic acid was 0.72 ± 0.58 ng/mL (mean ± SD) occurring 9 hours after the last dose, and the AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> for tazarotenic acid was 10.1 ± 7.2 ng·hr/mL. Systemic absorption was 0.91 ± 0.67% of the applied dose.</p><p>In a 14-day study in five subjects with psoriasis, measured doses of tazarotene 0.1% gel were applied daily by nursing staff to involved skin without occlusion (8 to 18% of total body surface area; mean ± SD: 13 ± 5%). The C<span class="Sub">max</span> for tazarotenic acid was 12.0 ± 7.6 ng/mL occurring 6 hours after the final dose, and the AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> for tazarotenic acid was 105 ± 55 ng·hr/mL. Systemic absorption was 14.8 ± 7.6% of the applied dose. Extrapolation of these results to represent dosing on 20% of total body surface yielded estimates for tazarotenic acid with C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 18.9 ± 10.6 ng/mL and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> of 172 ± 88 ng·hr/mL.</p><p>An <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> percutaneous absorption study, using radiolabeled drug and freshly excised human skin or human cadaver skin, indicated that approximately 4 to 5% of the applied dose was in the stratum corneum (tazarotene: tazarotenic acid = 5:1) and 2 to 4% was in the viable epidermis-dermis layer (tazarotene: tazarotenic acid = 2:1) 24 hours after topical application of the gel.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">A long-term study of tazarotene following oral administration of 0.025, 0.050, and 0.125 mg/kg/day to rats showed no indications of increased carcinogenic risks. Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter-term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in the rat 0.3 times that seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%.</p><p>A long-term study with topical administration of up to 0.1% tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice terminated at 88 weeks showed that dose levels of 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared to vehicle control animals. Systemic exposure at the highest dose was 2 times that seen in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%.</p><p>Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in a human lymphocyte assay. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test.</p><p>No impairment of fertility occurred in rats when male animals were treated for 70 days prior to mating and female animals were treated for 14 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation with topical doses of tazarotene gel up to 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat at the highest dose was 0.3 times that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%.    </p><p>No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in male rats treated for 70 days prior to mating with oral doses of up to 1 mg/kg/day tazarotene, which produced systemic exposure that was approximately equivalent to that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1%.</p><p>No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in female rats treated for 15 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation day 7 with oral doses of tazarotene up to 2 mg/kg/day. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of estrous stages and an increase in developmental effects at that dose, which produced systemic exposure 2 times that observed in subjects treated with the MRHD of tazarotene gel, 0.1% <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Psoriasis:</span> In two large vehicle-controlled clinical trials, Tazorac Gel, 0.05% and 0.1% applied once daily for 12 weeks was significantly more effective than vehicle in reducing the severity of the clinical signs of plaque psoriasis covering up to 20% of body surface area.
