</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Rx Only</span></p><h2>Folcaps Care One Description</h2><p class="First">Folcaps™ Care One is a prenatal multivitamin/mineral capsule with omega-3 fatty acids. Each red soft gelatin capsule for oral administration contains:</p><p><span class="Bold">INACTIVE INGREDIENTS:</span> Gelatin, glycerin, soybean oil, flaxseed oil, ethylvanillin, lecithin, yellow beeswax, titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide, and FD&amp;C Red No. 40.</p><h2>INTENDED USE</h2><p class="First">Folcaps™ Care One is intended to provide improved nutritional status before, during, and after pregnancy, through dietary supplementation of key vitamin/mineral and omega-3 fatty acids.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</span></p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First">Ingestion of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day has been shown to have potential antithrombotic effects, including an increased bleeding time and INR. Administration of omega-3 fatty acids should be avoided in patients on anti-coagulants and in those known to have inherited or acquired bleeding diathesis.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First">Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B12 is deficient. Folic acid in doses above 1.0 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Do not exceed recommended dosage. Folcaps™ Care One should be used with caution in patients with known sensitivity or allergy to fish or soy.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies on this product have not been performed to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.</p><h2>Folcaps Care One Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Usual dosage is one capsule daily, or as prescribed by a physician.</p><h2>How is Folcaps Care One Supplied</h2><p class="First">Folcaps™ Care One prenatal multivitamin/mineral capsules are red soft gelatin capsules packaged in bottles of 30 capsules.<br/>
