Verify the product name and dosage if dose exceeds 1.5 mg/kg.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Anaphylaxis: Has been reported with amphotericin B-containing drugs; facilities for cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be available during administration due to the possibility of anaphylactic reaction. If severe respiratory distress occurs, the infusion should be immediately discontinued; during the initial dosing, the drug should be administered under close clinical observation.</p><p>• Infusion reactions: Acute reactions (eg, fever, shaking chills, hypotension, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, tachypnea) may occur 1 to 3 hours after starting an intravenous infusion. These reactions are usually more common with the first few doses and generally diminish with subsequent doses. Avoid rapid infusion to prevent hypotension, hypokalemia, arrhythmias, and shock.</p><p>• Leukoencephalopathy: Has been reported following administration of amphotericin. Total body irradiation has been reported to be a possible predisposition.</p><p>• Nephrotoxicity: May cause nephrotoxicity; usual risk factors include underlying renal disease, concomitant nephrotoxic medications and daily and/or cumulative dosing of amphotericin. Avoid use with other nephrotoxic drugs; drug-induced renal toxicity usually improves with interrupting therapy, decreasing dosage, or increasing dosing interval. However permanent impairment may occur, especially in patients receiving large cumulative dose (eg, &gt;5 g) and in those also receiving other nephrotoxic drugs. Hydration and sodium repletion prior to administration may reduce the risk of developing nephrotoxicity.
