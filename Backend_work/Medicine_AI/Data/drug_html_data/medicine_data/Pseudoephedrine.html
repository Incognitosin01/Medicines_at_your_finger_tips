Death can occur from the misuse of cough and cold medicines in very young children.</p><p>Ask a doctor or pharmacist before using any other cough or cold medicine. Pseudoephedrine or other decongestants are contained in many combination medicines. Taking certain products together can cause you to get too much of a certain drug. Check the label to see if a medicine contains pseudoephedrine or a decongestant. Do not use pseudoephedrine if you have used a MAO inhibitor such as furazolidone (Furoxone), isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), rasagiline (Azilect), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar), or tranylcypromine (Parnate) in the last 14 days.

Death can occur from the misuse of cough and cold medicines in very young children.</p><p>Take this medicine with a full glass of water. Do not crush, chew, or break an extended-release tablet. Swallow it whole. Breaking or opening the pill may cause too much of the drug to be released at one time. You may need to shake the oral suspension (liquid) well just before you measure a dose. Measure the liquid with a special dose measuring spoon or medicine cup, not with a regular table spoon. If you do not have a dose measuring device, ask your pharmacist for one.</p><p>Do not take pseudoephedrine for longer than 7 days in a row.
