The follicular phase FSH and midcycle surge of gonadotropins are inhibited. In addition, combination hormonal contraceptives produce alterations in the genital tract, including changes in the cervical mucus, rendering it unfavorable for sperm penetration even if ovulation occurs. Changes in the endometrium may also occur, producing an unfavorable environment for nidation. Combination hormonal contraceptive drugs may alter the tubal transport of the ova through the fallopian tubes. Progestational agents may also alter sperm fertility (Rivera 1999).</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel: Rapid</p><p>Tampons do not interfere with absorption.</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Ethinyl estradiol: Hepatic via CYP3A4; forms metabolites (weak estrogenic activity)</p><p>Etonogestrel: Hepatic via CYP3A4; forms metabolites (activity not known)</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel: Urine, bile, and feces</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Vaginal: Ethinyl estradiol: 59 hours; Etonogestrel: 200 hours</p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>Serum levels (contraceptive effectiveness) decrease after 3 weeks of continuous use</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Ethinyl estradiol: 45 hours; Etonogestrel: 29 hours </p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>Ethinyl estradiol: 98.5%, primarily to albumin</p><p>Etonogestrel: ~32% to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and ~66% to albumin; SHBG capacity is affected by plasma ethinyl estradiol levels</p><h2>Special Populations: Hepatic Function Impairment</h2><p>Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Contraception:</b> Prevention of pregnancy.</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Abnormal uterine bleeding</h3><p>Based on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists committee opinion on the management of acute abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-aged women, ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel (among other oral contraceptive combinations) is effective and recommended for the management of abnormal uterine bleeding <sup>[ACOG 2013]</sup>.</p><h3>Dysmenorrhea</h3><p>Based on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Practice Bulletin on Noncontraceptive Uses of Hormonal Contraceptives, ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel (among other oral contraceptive combinations) is effective and recommended for the management of dysmenorrhea <sup>[ACOG 2010]</sup>.</p><h3>Menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia)</h3><p>Based on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Practice Bulletin on Noncontraceptive Uses of Hormonal Contraceptives, ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel (among other oral contraceptive combinations) is effective and recommended for the management of menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) <sup>[ACOG 2010]</sup>.</p><h3>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women with menstrual irregularities and hirsutism/acne</h3><p>Based on the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel (among other oral contraceptive combinations) is effective and recommended for the treatment of menstrual irregularities and hirsutism/acne in women with PCOS <sup>[ES [Legro 2013]]</sup>.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, to ethinyl estradiol, etonogestrel, or any component of the formulation; breast cancer or other estrogen- or progestin-sensitive cancer (current or a history of); hepatic tumors (benign or malignant) or hepatic disease; pregnancy; undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding; concurrent use of hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir.</p><p>Use is also contraindicated in women at high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic diseases including: Cerebrovascular disease; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus with vascular disease; DVT or PE (current or history of); headaches with focal neurological symptoms; migraine headaches with aura or migraine headaches if &gt;35 years of age; hypertension (uncontrolled); thrombogenic valvular or rhythm diseases of the heart (eg, subacute bacterial endocarditis with valvular disease, atrial fibrillation); women &gt;35 years of age who smoke; inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathies.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Prodromi of a thrombosis (eg, angina pectoris or transient ischemic attack); severe dyslipoproteinemia; major surgery with prolonged immobilization, any ocular lesion from ophthalmic vascular disease such as partial or complete loss of vision or defect in visual fields; pancreatitis or history of pancreatitis with severe hypertriglyceridemia</p><p>Documentation of allergenic cross-reactivity for progestins and estrogens is limited.

A new ring is inserted 7 days after the last was removed (even if bleeding is not complete) and should be inserted at approximately the same time of day the ring was removed the previous week.</p><p><i>Initial treatment:</i></p><p>No hormonal contraceptive use in the past month: Insert ring on the first day of menstrual cycle ("Day 1"). May also insert on days 2 to 5 even if bleeding is not complete, however, <b>a spermicide or barrier method of contraception should be used for the following 7 days.</b>*</p><p>Switching from combination hormonal contraceptive: Ring can be inserted on any day but at the latest on the day following the usual hormone free interval, if she is using the hormonal method consistently and correctly, or if it is reasonably sure she is not pregnant.</p><p>Switching from progestin-only contraceptive: <b>A spermicide or barrier method of contraception should be used for the following 7 days with any of the following.</b>*</p><p>If previously using a progestin-only mini-pill, insert the ring on any day of the month; insert the vaginal ring on the day after the last mini-pill; do not skip days between the last pill and insertion of the ring.</p><p>If previously using an implant, insert the ring on the same day of implant removal.</p><p>If previously using a progestin-containing IUD, insert the ring on day of IUD removal.</p><p>If previously using a progestin injection, insert the ring on the day the next injection would be given.</p><p>Following complete 1st trimester abortion or miscarriage: Insert ring within the first 5 days of abortion or miscarriage. If not inserted within 5 days, follow instructions for "No hormonal contraceptive use within the past month" and instruct patient to use a nonhormonal contraceptive in the interim.</p><p>Following delivery or 2nd trimester abortion or miscarriage: Insert ring 4 weeks postpartum (in women who are not breast-feeding) or following 2nd trimester abortion or miscarriage. <b>A spermicide or barrier method of contraception should be used for the following 7 days.</b>*</p><p><i>Additional contraceptive considerations:</i></p><p>Inadvertent removal or expulsion: If the ring is accidentally removed from the vagina at any time during the 3-week period of use, it may be rinsed with cool or lukewarm water (not hot) and reinserted as soon as possible. If the ring is not reinserted within 3 hours, contraceptive effectiveness will be decreased. If the ring is accidently removed from the vagina for &gt;3 continuous hours during weeks 1 and 2, the ring should be reinserted as soon as the woman remembers and <b>a spermicide or barrier method of contraception should be used until the ring has been in place for 7 consecutive days.</b>* If the ring is accidently removed from the vagina for &gt;3 hours during week 3, the ring should be discarded. A new ring may be inserted immediately, restarting a new 3-week cycle, OR a new ring may be inserted ≤7 days from the time the previous ring was removed or expelled (the second option should only be done if a vaginal ring was in continuous use for ≥7 days prior to the inadvertent expulsion/removal). With either option, <b>a spermicide or barrier method of contraception should be used until the ring has been in place for 7 consecutive days.</b>*</p><p>If the ring has been removed for longer than 1 week or for an unknown period of time, pregnancy must be ruled out prior to restarting therapy. <b>A spermicide or barrier method of contraception should be used for the following 7 days.</b>*</p><p>Additional guidelines are available following delayed insertion/reinsertion of vaginal ring (Curtis 2016a).</p><p>Prolonged use: If the ring has been left in place for up to 1 extra week (up to 4 weeks total); a new ring should be inserted following a 1-week (ring-free) interval. Protection continues during week 4, however, if the ring is left in place &gt;4 weeks, pregnancy must be ruled out prior to insertion and <b>a spermicide or barrier method of contraception should be used for the following 7 days.</b>*</p><p>Disconnected ring: In the event the ring disconnects at the weld joint, discard and replace with a new ring.</p><p>*<b>Note:</b> Certain female barrier methods (eg, diaphragm, female condom) may interfere with proper ring placement, and therefore, are not recommended for use as an additional form of contraception.</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Contraception:</b> Females: Children and Adolescents: Vaginal: Refer to adult dosing; not to be used prior to menarche.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Wash hands and remove ring from protective pouch (keep pouch for later ring disposal). Press sides of ring together between thumb and index finger and insert folded ring into vagina. An optional alternative is to insert using the ring applicator (available separately). Specific placement is not required for ring to be effective, but ring should be inserted far enough into the vagina as to be comfortable. To remove, hook index finger around rim and pull out. Vaginal ring <b>cannot</b> be disposed of in the toilet. New rings should be inserted at approximately the same time of day the ring was removed the previous week. If the ring accidentally falls out, it may be rinsed with cool or warm (not hot) water and replaced. However, it must be replaced within 3 hours. Refer to dosing if ring is out of place for &gt;3 hours. Regularly check for the presence of the ring in the vagina (eg, before and after intercourse). Tampons do not interfere with the effectiveness of the ring; caution should be used when removing tampon not to remove ring. Certain female barrier methods (eg, diaphragm, female condom) may interfere with proper ring placement, and therefore, are not recommended for use as a back-up method of contraception. Ensure proper vaginal placement of the ring to avoid inadvertent urinary bladder insertion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Prior to dispensing, store refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).

This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, CHCs, including ethinyl estradiol/etonogestrel, should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Breast cancer: In women at risk for breast cancer due to family history or susceptibility genes (<i>BRCA1, BRCA2</i>), the use of combination hormonal contraceptives has not been shown to modify the risk for breast cancer. However, breast cancer is a hormonal sensitive tumor and the prognosis for women with a current or recent history of breast cancer may be worse with combination hormonal contraceptive use (Curtis 2016b). Use is contraindicated in women with (or history of) breast cancer.</p><p>• Cervical cancer: The use of combination hormonal contraceptives has been associated with a slight increased risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia; however, studies are not consistent and may be related to additional risk factors (Gierisch 2013). Theoretically, use may affect prognosis of existing disease. Women awaiting treatment for cervical cancer may use combination hormonal contraceptives (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Chloasma: Combination hormonal contraceptives, as well as sun exposure and pregnancy, are triggers for chloasma. Women with a susceptibility to chloasma or additional risk factors should avoid exposure to sun or ultraviolet radiation during therapy (Handel 2014).</p><p>• Cholestasis: Risk of cholestasis may be increased with previous cholestasis of pregnancy or cholestasis with prior oral contraceptive use.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported.</p><p>• Lipid effects: Combination hormonal contraceptives may adversely affect lipid levels, including serum triglycerides. Women with hypertriglyceridemia or a family history of hypertriglyceridemia may be at increased risk of pancreatitis when using combination hormonal contraceptives. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia.</p><p>• Retinal vascular thrombosis: Discontinue if unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions occur and immediately evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis.</p><p>• Thromboembolic disorders: Discontinue use of combination hormonal contraceptives if an arterial or venous thrombotic event occurs. Oral contraceptives may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (risk is greatest during first year of use and less than the risk associated with pregnancy); some studies suggest this risk may be higher in preparations with third- or fourth-generation progestins and/or high dose ethinyl estradiol. Women with inherited thrombophilias (eg, protein C or S deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin mutation, antithrombin deficiency) may have increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Age &gt;35 years, hypertension, obesity, and tobacco use also increase the risk of thrombotic events in women taking combination hormonal contraceptives (ASRM 2017; Curtis 2016b; DeSancho 2010; van Vlijmen 2011). Combination hormonal contraceptives may also increase the risk of arterial thrombosis (eg, MI, stroke) and should not be used in women with a history of stroke or ischemic heart disease (Curtis 2016b). Use of combination hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated in women with a high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic disease.</p><p>• Toxic shock syndrome: Has been reported (causal relationship has not been established); increased risk with tampon use.</p><p>• Vaginal bleeding: Breakthrough or intracyclic bleeding and spotting may occur, especially during the first 3 months of therapy. In addition, occasional missed periods may occur. Presentation of irregular, unresolving vaginal bleeding warrants further evaluation to rule out malignancy or pregnancy. Amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur after discontinuing combination hormonal contraceptives, especially when such a condition was preexistent.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Bariatric surgery:</p><p>- Altered absorption: Consider nonoral contraceptive options in patients who had specific bariatric procedures (Roux-en-Y, biliopancreatic diversion); malabsorptive procedures can potentially decrease absorption of oral contraceptives (Kominiarek 2017; Mechanick 2013; Schlatter 2017). It is difficult to recommend against the use of oral contraceptives in restrictive procedures (sleeve gastrectomy, gastric banding) as the evidence is limited (Merki-Feld 2015).</p><p>- Venous thromboembolism risk: Consider discontinuation of estrogen-containing medications 30 days prior to bariatric surgery to reduce risk of venous thromboembolism; however, practice may vary based upon institutional protocols (Mechanick 2013).</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (eg, hypertension, low HDL, high LDL, high triglycerides, older age, diabetes, women who smoke); use of combination hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (Curtis 2016b). Use is contraindicated in women at high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic diseases.</p><p>• Depression: Use with caution in patients with a history of depression; discontinue if serious depression recurs.</p><p>• Diabetes: May impair glucose tolerance; use caution in women with diabetes or prediabetes. In general, use of combination oral contraceptives has limited effects on daily insulin needs and no long term effects on diabetes control in women with nonvascular disease. However, use in women with concomitant nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, other vascular disease, or diabetes &gt;20 years duration should be evaluated for contraceptive use based on the severity of the condition (Curtis 2016b). Use is contraindicated in women with diabetes mellitus and vascular disease.</p><p>• Endometrial or ovarian cancer: The risk of endometrial or ovarian cancer is decreased in women using combination hormonal contraceptives; it is not known if use of the contraceptive ring also decreases this risk (Curtis 2016b; Walker 2015). Women awaiting treatment for endometrial or ovarian cancer may use combination hormonal contraceptives (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Gallbladder disease: Combination hormonal contraceptives may have a small increased risk of gallbladder disease or worsen existing gallbladder disease (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Hepatic adenomas or carcinomas: Use of combination hormonal contraceptives is associated with hepatic adenomas (rare); rupture may cause fatal intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Long term use may be associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (rare). Use is contraindicated in women with preexisting hepatic tumors.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Combination hormonal contraceptives may be poorly metabolized in women with hepatic impairment. Use is contraindicated in hepatic disease. Discontinue if jaundice develops during therapy or if liver function becomes abnormal. Use of combination hormonal contraceptives may be considered in women with mild (compensated) cirrhosis but should not be used in women with severe (decompensated) cirrhosis (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Hepatitis: Initiation of combination hormonal contraceptives is not recommended in women with acute viral hepatitis or during a flare. Continuation of use in women with chronic hepatitis has not been shown to increase the rate or severity of cirrhotic fibrosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Continuation of use in women who are carriers has not been shown to trigger liver failure or severe hepatic dysfunction (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Hereditary angioedema: Estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms in women with hereditary angioedema (Geng 2013; Zuraw 2013).</p><p>• Hypertension: The risk of hypertension may be increased with age, dose, and duration of use. Combination hormonal contraceptives should not be used in women with hypertension and vascular disease, or persistent blood pressure values ≥160 mm Hg systolic or ≥100 mm Hg diastolic. The risks of use may not outweigh the benefits of treatment in women with less severe hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg systolic or 90 to 99 mm Hg diastolic) or those with hypertension that is adequately controlled (Curtis 2016a). Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (eg, older age, smoking, diabetes) should be considered when prescribing contraceptives (Curtis 2016b). The manufacturer contraindicates use in women with uncontrolled hypertension and recommends monitoring women with well-controlled hypertension; discontinue therapy if blood pressure rises significantly.</p><p>• Migraine: Evaluate new, recurrent, severe, or persistent headaches and consider discontinuing therapy if appropriate. Use of combination hormonal contraceptives may be considered in women who have migraines without aura (including menstrual migraines) (Curtis 2016b). Use in women with headaches with focal neurological symptoms, or migraine headaches with or without aura if &gt;35 years of age is contraindicated.</p><p>• Solid organ transplant: Although data is limited, serious medical complications have been reported in women with complicated organ transplants (eg, graft failure, rejection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy); use of combination hormonal contraceptives is not recommended in women with complicated organ transplants (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Systemic lupus erythematosus: Women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at an increased risk for heart disease, stroke, and VTE. Combination hormonal contraceptives should not be used in women with SLE who have positive (or unknown) antiphospholipid antibodies, due to an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis (Curtis 2016b).</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Thyroid replacement therapy: Estrogens may increase thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone while receiving estrogens.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Obese: In a study using the vaginal ring, ethinyl estradiol serum concentrations were decreased in obese women (BMI 30 to 39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; n=19) in comparison to women of normal weight (BMI 19 to 24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; n=18; p=0.004); etonogestrel concentrations did not differ significantly. Bleeding and spotting were more frequent in the obese women. The study was not powered to evaluate contraceptive effectiveness (Westhoff 2012).</p><p>• Pediatric: Not for use prior to menarche.</p><p>• Postmenopausal women: Use is not indicated in postmenopausal women.</p><p>• Smokers:<b><b>[US Boxed Warning]: <b>Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, combination oral contraceptives should not be used by women who are &gt;35 years of age and smoke.</b></b></b></p><p>• Surgical patients: Whenever possible, discontinue at least 4 weeks prior to and for 2 weeks following major surgery or other surgeries known to have an increased risk of thromboembolism or during periods of prolonged immobilization.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Vaginal preparation: Vaginally administered combination hormonal contraceptive agents may have similar adverse effects associated with oral contraceptive products. In order to reduce some of the possible risks, the minimum dosage combination of estrogen/progestin that will effectively treat the individual patient should be used. May not be appropriate for use in women with conditions that make the vagina susceptible to irritation or ulceration; vaginal/cervical erosion and ulceration has been reported. Ring breakage has been reported including with concomitant use of intravaginal products (eg, antibiotic, antifungal, lubricant) and may cause vaginal injury and associated pain, discomfort, and bleeding. The patients and their sexual partner may feel the ring in the vagina during intercourse.

If the ring was used as directed and 2 consecutive menstrual periods are missed, assess pregnancy status before a new dosing cycle is started. In addition, assess pregnancy status if ring was in place &gt;4 weeks.</p><p>Monitor patient for vision changes; blood pressure; signs and symptoms of thromboembolic disorders; signs or symptoms of depression; glycemic control in patients with diabetes; lipid profiles in patients being treated for hyperlipidemias. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling, if indicated, should be performed to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding. In patients with persistent urinary symptoms, assess for inadvertent urinary bladder insertion if ring is not otherwise located.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>The manufacturer states that combination hormonal contraceptives should not be started until ≥4 weeks after delivery in women who choose not to breastfeed, or ≥4 weeks after a second trimester abortion or miscarriage.</p><p>Due to the increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) postpartum, combination hormonal contraceptives should not be started in any woman &lt;21 days following delivery. The risk decreases to baseline by postpartum day 42. Use of combination hormonal contraceptives in women between 21 and 42 days after delivery should take into consideration the individual woman's risk factors for VTE (eg, age ≥35 years, previous VTE, thrombophilia, immobility, preeclampsia, transfusion at delivery, cesarean delivery, peripartum cardiomyopathy, BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, postpartum hemorrhage, smoking) (Curtis 2016b).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Use is contraindicated in pregnant women.
