It promotes immune responses to help slow tumor growth.</p><p>Thalomid is used together with dexamethasone to treat multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer).</p><p>Thalomid is also used to treat and prevent moderate to severe skin lesions caused by leprosy.</p><p>Thalomid is available only in a 28-day supply from a certified pharmacy under a special program called Thalomid REMS. You must be registered in the program and agree to use birth control as required. You will be limited to a 28-day supply of medicine each time your prescription is refilled.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Never use Thalomid if you are pregnant. Even one dose of thalidomide can cause severe, life-threatening birth defects or death of a baby if the mother or the father is taking this medicine at the time of conception or during pregnancy.</b></p><p><b>Both men and women using this medicine should use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy</b> during treatment, and for up to 4 weeks after your last dose.</p><p>Thalomid may cause blood clots.
