The vaccine is redeveloped each year to contain specific strains of inactivated (killed) flu virus that are recommended by public health officials for that year.</p><p>Influenza virus (commonly known as "the flu") is a serious disease caused by a virus. Influenza virus can spread from one person to another through small droplets of saliva that are expelled into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also be passed through contact with objects the infected person has touched, such as a door handle or other surfaces.</p><p>Afluria vaccine (flu shot) is a "killed virus" vaccine. Afluria works by exposing you to a small dose of the virus, which helps your body to develop immunity to the disease. Afluria vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>Afluria is for use in adults and children who are at least 6 months old.</p><p>Becoming infected with influenza is much more dangerous to your health than receiving Afluria vaccine. Influenza causes thousands of deaths each year, and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations. However, like any medicine, Afluria can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.</p><p>Like any vaccine, Afluria may not provide protection from disease in every person. Afluria will not prevent illness caused by avian flu ("bird flu").</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>The injectable Afluria (flu shot) is a "killed virus" vaccine. Influenza virus vaccine is also available in a nasal spray form, which is a "live virus" vaccine. This medication guide addresses only the injectable form of this vaccine.</p><p>You can still receive a vaccine if you have a minor cold. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving Afluria.</p><p>Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving Afluria. If you ever need to receive Afluria in the future, you will need to tell your doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects.</p><p>Like any vaccine, Afluria may not provide protection from disease in every person. Afluria will not prevent illness caused by avian flu ("bird flu").</p><p>Influenza virus injectable (killed virus) vaccine will not cause you to become ill with the flu virus that it contains. However, you may have flu-like symptoms at any time during flu season that may be caused by other strains of influenza virus.</p><p>Becoming infected with influenza is much more dangerous to your health than receiving Afluria. However, like any medicine, Afluria can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.</p><h2>Before receiving Afluria</h2><p>You may not be able to receive Afluria if you are allergic to eggs, or if you have;</p><ul>

In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving Afluria.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that pregnant women get a flu shot during any trimester of pregnancy to protect themselves and their newborn babies from flu.</p><p>It is not known whether influenza virus vaccine passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Do not receive Afluria without telling your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby. Afluria should not be given to a child younger than 6 months old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is Afluria given?</h2><p>Afluria is given as an injection (shot) into a muscle. You will receive this injection in a doctor's office or other clinic setting.</p><p>You should receive a flu vaccine every year. Your immunity will gradually decrease over the 12 months after you receive the Afluria . Children receiving Afluria may need a booster shot one month after receiving the first vaccine.</p><p>The Afluria is usually given in October or November. Some people may need to have their vaccines earlier or later. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend treating fever and pain with an aspirin-free pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, and others) when the shot is given and for the next 24 hours. Follow the label directions or your doctor's instructions about how much of this medicine to give your child.</p><p>It is especially important to prevent fever from occurring in a child who has a seizure disorder such as epilepsy.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since flu shots are usually given only one time per year, you will most likely not be on a dosing schedule. Call your doctor if you forget to receive your yearly flu shot in October or November.</p><p>If your child misses a booster dose of Afluria, call your doctor for instructions.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of Afluria is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Afluria side effects</h2><p>Afluria vaccine will not cause you to become ill with the flu virus that it contains.
