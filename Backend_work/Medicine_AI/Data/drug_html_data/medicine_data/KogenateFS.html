Antihemophilic factor is a naturally occurring protein in the blood that helps blood to clot. A lack of antihemophilic factor VIII is the cause of hemophilia A.</p><p>Kogenate FS works by temporarily raising levels of factor VIII in the blood to aid in clotting.</p><p>Kogenate FS is used to treat or prevent bleeding episodes in adults and children with hemophilia A. It is also used to control bleeding related to surgery or dentistry in a person with hemophilia, and to prevent joint damage in people age 16 or older with severe hemophilia A and no prior joint damage.</p><p>Kogenate FS is not for use in people with von Willebrand disease.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Kogenate FS if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to antihemophilic factor in the past.</p><p>Your body may develop antibodies to antihemophilic factor, making it less effective.
