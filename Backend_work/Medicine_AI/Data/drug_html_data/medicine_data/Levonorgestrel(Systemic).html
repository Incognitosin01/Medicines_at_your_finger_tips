Contraceptive failure is possible. Management: Given the potential for progestin-only preparations to fail to prevent pregnancy during acitretin therapy, such products should not be relied upon. Alternative, nonhormonal forms of contraception must be employed during acitretin therapy.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Anticoagulants: Progestins may diminish the therapeutic effect of Anticoagulants. More specifically, the potential prothrombotic effects of some progestins and progestin-estrogen combinations may counteract anticoagulant effects.  Management: Carefully weigh the prospective benefits of progestins against the potential increased risk of procoagulant effects and thromboembolism.  Use is considered contraindicated under some circumstances. Refer to related guidelines for specific recommendations.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Antidiabetic Agents: Hyperglycemia-Associated Agents may diminish the therapeutic effect of Antidiabetic Agents. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Aprepitant: May decrease the serum concentration of Progestins (Contraceptive).

Management: Use alternative or concomitant methods of contraception in patients taking armodafinil and for one month after armodafinil discontinuation.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Artemether: May decrease the serum concentration of Progestins (Contraceptive). Management: Consider the use of an alternative (i.e., non-hormonal) means of contraception in all women of childbearing potential who are using artemether.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Atazanavir: May increase the serum concentration of Progestins (Contraceptive). However, atazanavir may lead to decreased ethinyl estradiol concentrations and decreased effectiveness of oral contraceptive products. Management: Consider an alternative or additional method of contraception, particularly with combined estrogen/progestin products. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate may be used without a need for additional contraception.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Barbiturates: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Progestins (Contraceptive).

When using levonorgestrel as an emergency contraceptive, non-US recommendations suggest doubling the levonorgestrel dose to 3 mg if carbamazepine was used in the past 4 weeks.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Carfilzomib: May enhance the thrombogenic effect of Progestins (Contraceptive). Management: Consider alternative, non-hormonal methods of contraception in patients requiring therapy with carfilzomib.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Cenobamate: May decrease the serum concentration of Hormonal Contraceptives. Management: Women should use additional or alternative non-hormonal birth control while taking cenobamate.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Cladribine: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Hormonal Contraceptives.

The CDC recommends that obese women can generally use any type of contraceptive but suggests that levonorgestrel may be less efficacious in obese women compared to ulipristal acetate (Curtis 2016a).</p><p>• Fertility: Barrier contraception is recommended immediately following emergency contraception (ACOG 2015; Curtis 2016a).</p><p>• HIV infection protection: Emergency contraceptives do not protect against HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases (Curtis 2016a).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Evaluate for pregnancy, spontaneous abortion or ectopic pregnancy if normal (expected) menstrual period is delayed for ≥1 week following emergency contraception, or if lower abdominal pain or persistent irregular bleeding develops (ACOG 2015).</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Levonorgestrel may be used as an emergency contraceptive in women with contraindications to conventional hormonal contraceptive agents (eg, cardiovascular disease, migraines, liver disease) (ACOG 2015; Curtis 2016b).</p><p>A rapid return of fertility is expected following use for emergency contraception; routine contraceptive measures should be initiated or continued following use to ensure ongoing prevention of pregnancy. Any regular contraceptive method can be started immediately after levonorgestrel; however, a barrier method (or abstinence from sexual intercourse) is also needed for 7 days (ACOG 2015; Curtis 2016a).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Not for use in women confirmed to be pregnant.
