Each weight marking on the syringe plunger delivers enough paste to treat 220 lb (100 kg) of body weight.</p><h3>Parasite Control Program</h3><p class="First">All horses should be included in a regular parasite control program with particular attention being paid to mares, foals, and yearlings. Foals should be treated initially at 4 weeks of age, and routine treatment repeated as appropriate. Consult your veterinarian for a control program to meet your specific needs. Equimax Paste effectively controls gastrointestinal nematodes, cestodes and bots of horses. Regular treatment will reduce the chances of colic caused by <span class="Italics">Anoplocephala perfoliata</span> and verminous arteritis caused by <span class="Italics">Strongylus vulgaris</span>.</p><h3>Product Advantages</h3><p class="First">Equimax Paste kills important internal parasites, including tapeworms, bots and the arterial stages of <span class="Italics">S. vulgaris</span>, with a single dose. Equimax Paste contains two potent antiparasitic agents that are neither benzimidazoles nor organophosphates.</p><h2>SAFETY</h2><p class="First">Equimax Paste may be used in horses 4 weeks of age and older. Stallions and breeding, pregnant or lactating mares may be treated without adverse effects on fertility.</p><p>In a tolerance study in which 3- to 4-week-old foals were treated at 10X once, loose watery stools were observed on post-treatment days 1, 2, and 5-9 in one foal. These signs resolved without treatment by day 10, and no other foals were affected.</p><p>In a reproductive safety study, eleven mares were treated with a 3X dose of Equimax Paste every two weeks throughout breeding, pregnancy and lactation, up until the foal was three months of age. Ten mares served as controls and were treated with the vehicle paste in a similar manner. An increased incidence of colic was observed in treated mares as compared to control mares. In addition, elevations of GGT and AST were more frequent in the 3X treated mares, and in two mares these enzymes were elevated at the time of colic episodes.</p><p>One treated mare was dropped from the study because she did not conceive after three breeding attempts.</p><p>Two treated mares had abnormally short diestrous periods of two days and eight days on the first estrous cycle following the birth of the study foal. In addition, one of these two mares failed to ovulate in the second and third estrous cycles.</p><p>In the first few weeks of life, foals born to the 3X treated mares had a higher incidence of transient ocular discharge and gastrointestinal disturbances (loose stools, diarrhea) and depression requiring medical intervention as compared to foals born to control mares.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Equimax Paste has been formulated specifically for use in horses and ponies <span class="Bold">only</span>. This product should not be used in other animal species as severe adverse reactions, including fatalities in dogs, may result.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First">Do not use in horses intended for human consumption.</p><h2>HUMAN WARNINGS</h2><p class="First">Not for use in humans. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Refrain from eating or smoking when handling. Wash hands after use. Avoid contact with eyes. The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) contains more detailed occupational safety information. To report adverse reactions in users, to obtain more information, or to obtain a MSDS, contact Bimeda Inc. at 1-888-524-6332.</p><h2>ENVIRONMENTAL WARNINGS</h2><p class="First">Ivermectin and excreted ivermectin residues may adversely affect aquatic organisms. Do not contaminate ground or surface water. Dispose of the syringe in an approved landfill or by incineration.</p><p class="First">Store at room temperature (25°C/77°F), with excursions permitted between 15°–30°C (59°–86°F).</p><h2>NOTE TO USER</h2><p class="First">Swelling and itching reactions after treatment with ivermectin paste have occurred in horses carrying heavy infections of neck threadworm (<span class="Italics">Onchocerca</span> sp. microfilariae). These reactions were most likely the result of microfilariae dying in large numbers. Symptomatic treatment may be advisable. Consult your veterinarian should any such reactions occur. Healing of summer sores involving extensive tissue changes may require other appropriate therapy in conjunction with treatment with Equimax Paste. Reinfection, and measures for its prevention, should also be considered. Consult your veterinarian if the condition does not improve.</p><p>To report adverse reactions, call Bimeda Inc. at 1-888-524-6332.</p><p class="First">NADA #141-215, Approved by FDA</p><p><span class="Bold">Manufactured by:</span><br/>
