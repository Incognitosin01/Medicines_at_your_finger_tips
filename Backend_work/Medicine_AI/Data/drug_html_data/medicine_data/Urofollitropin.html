This hormone is important in the development of follicles (eggs) that are produced by the ovaries in women.</p><p>Urofollitropin is used together with other medicines to treat infertility in women with FSH deficiency. Urofollitropin is also used to help the ovaries produce multiple eggs for use in "in-vitro" fertilization.</p><p>Urofollitropin alone will not cause ovulation (production of an egg by the ovaries). You will need to receive other medicines to stimulate ovulation.</p><p>Urofollitropin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use  urofollitropin if you have primary ovarian failure, abnormal vaginal bleeding, uncontrolled thyroid or adrenal gland disorders, an ovarian cyst, breast cancer, uterine or ovarian cancer, a pituitary gland tumor, or infertility that is not caused by lack of ovulation.</p><p><b>Do not use urofollitropin if you are pregnant.</b></p><p>Stop using urofollitropin, do not have sexual intercourse, and call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms: stomach pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rapid weight gain, little or no urinating, or pain when you breathe, rapid heart rate, or shortness of breath.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use this medicine if you are allergic to urofollitropin or similar medicines (such as follitropin, lutropin alfa, menotropin), or if you have:</p><ul>
