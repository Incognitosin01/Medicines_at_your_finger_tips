When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Acticlate Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>The usual dosage and frequency of administration of Acticlate and Acticlate CAP differs from that of the other tetracyclines. Exceeding the recommended dosage may result in an increased incidence of adverse reactions.</li>
<li>Administer Acticlate and Acticlate CAP with adequate amounts of fluid to wash down the drugs and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</li>
<li>If gastric irritation occurs, Acticlate and Acticlate CAP may be given with food or milk <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span></li>

</ol>
</li>
</ul><h3>Dosage in Pediatric Patients</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>For all pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg with severe or life threatening infections (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), the recommended dosage of Acticlate and Acticlate CAP is 2.2 mg per kg of body weight administered every 12 hours. Pediatric patients weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</li>
<li>For pediatric patients with less severe disease (greater than 8 years of age and weighing less than 45 kg), the recommended dosage schedule of Acticlate and Acticlate CAP is 4.4 mg per kg of body weight divided into two doses on the first day of treatment, followed by a maintenance dose of 2.2 mg per kg of body weight (given as a single daily dose or divided into twice daily doses). For pediatric patients weighing over 45 kg, the usual adult dose should be used.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosage for Prophylaxis of Malaria</h3><p class="First">For adults, the recommended dose of Acticlate is 100 mg daily.</p><p>For pediatric patients 8 years of age and older, the recommended dosage of Acticlate and Acticlate CAP is 2 mg per kg of body weight administered once daily. Pediatric patients weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose.</p><p>Prophylaxis should begin 1 or 2 days before travel to the malarious area. Prophylaxis should be continued daily during travel in the malarious area and for 4 weeks after the traveler leaves the malarious area.</p><h3>Dosage for Inhalational Anthrax (Post-Exposure)</h3><p class="First">For adults, the recommended dosage is 100 mg, of Acticlate, by mouth, twice-a-day for 60 days.</p><p>For pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg, the recommended dosage of Acticlate and Acticlate CAP is 2.2 mg per kg of body weight, by mouth, twice-a-day for 60 days. Pediatric patients weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Acticlate Tablets:</span></p><p>Acticlate (doxycycline hyclate) Tablets, 75 mg are round, convex, light-teal, film-coated, tablets with “75” debossed on one side of the tablet and “AQ101” debossed on the other (each tablet contains 75 mg doxycycline as 86.6 mg doxycycline hyclate).</p><p>Acticlate (doxycycline hyclate) Tablets, 150 mg are oval-shaped, convex, mossy-green, film-coated tablets. Each side of the functionally scored tablet has two parallel score lines for splitting into 3 equal portions with “A” debossed on each portion of one side of the tablet, and no debossing on the other (each tablet contains 150 mg doxycycline as 173.2 mg doxycycline hyclate).</p><p><span class="Bold">Acticlate CAP Capsules:</span></p><p>Acticlate CAP (doxycycline hyclate) Capsules, 75 mg have a navy blue opaque body and cap with the inscription “AQUA 101C75” in black (each capsule contains 75 mg doxycycline as 86.6 mg doxycycline hyclate).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Acticlate and Acticlate CAP are contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Tooth Development</h3><p class="First">The use of drugs of the tetracycline-class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Use Acticlate and Acticlate CAP in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening conditions (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), particularly when there are no alternative therapies.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Acticlate and Acticlate CAP, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Photosensitivity</h3><p class="First">Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.</p><h3>Potential for Microbial Overgrowth</h3><p class="First">Acticlate and Acticlate CAP may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If such infections occur, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.</p><h3>Severe Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">Severe skin reactions, such as exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline <span class="Italics">[See Adverse Reactions (6)</span>]. If severe skin reactions occur, doxycycline should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy should be instituted.</p><h3>Intracranial Hypertension</h3><p class="First">Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including Acticlate and Acticlate CAP. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and Acticlate and Acticlate CAP should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.</p><p>Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize.</p><h3>Delayed Skeletal Development</h3><p class="First">All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg per kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued.</p><p>Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity also has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Tetracycline-class drugs can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, but data for doxycycline are limited. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p><h3>Antianabolic Action</h3><p class="First">The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.</p><h3>Incomplete Suppression of Malaria</h3><p class="First">Doxycycline offers substantial but not complete suppression of the asexual blood stages of <span class="Italics">Plasmodium</span> strains.</p><p>Doxycycline does not suppress <span class="Italics">P. falciparum’s</span> sexual blood stage gametocytes. Subjects completing this prophylactic regimen may still transmit the infection to mosquitoes outside endemic areas.</p><h3>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing Acticlate and Acticlate CAP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>Laboratory Monitoring for Long-Term Therapy</h3><p class="First">In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during clinical trials or post-approval use of tetracycline-class drugs, including doxycycline. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, and inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region, and pancreatitis. Hepatotoxicity has been reported. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines. Superficial discoloration of the adult permanent dentition, reversible upon drug discontinuation and professional dental cleaning has been reported. Permanent tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia may occur with drugs of the tetracycline class when used during tooth development [<span class="Italics">See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]. Instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class. Most of these patients took medications immediately before going to bed [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration</span> (<span class="Italics">2.1</span>)].</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin:</span> Maculopapular and erythematous rashes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, exfoliative dermatitis, and erythema multiforme have been reported. Photosensitivity has been reported [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> (<span class="Italics">5.3</span>)].</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal:</span> Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose-related [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> (<span class="Italics">5.8</span>)].</p><p><span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity reactions:</span> Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, serum sickness, pericarditis, and exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood:</span> Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported.</p><p><span class="Italics">Intracranial Hypertension:</span> Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> (<span class="Italics">5.6</span>)].</p><p><span class="Italics">Thyroid Gland Changes:</span> When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of thyroid glands. No abnormalities of thyroid function are known to occur.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Anticoagulant Drugs</h3><p class="First">Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.</p><h3>Penicillin</h3><p class="First">Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines, including Acticlate and Acticlate CAP in conjunction with penicillin.</p><h3>Antacids and Iron Preparations</h3><p class="First">Absorption of tetracyclines, including Acticlate and Acticlate CAP is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, bismuth subsalicylate, and iron-containing preparations.</p><h3>Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First">Concurrent use of tetracyclines, including Acticlate and Acticlate CAP may render oral contraceptives less effective.</p><h3>Barbiturates and Anti-Epileptics</h3><p class="First">Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of doxycycline.</p><h3>Penthrane®</h3><p class="First">The concurrent use of tetracycline and Penthrane<span class="Sup">®</span> (methoxyflurane) has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.</p><h3>Drug and Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">False elevations of urinary catecholamines may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category D:</span> [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> (<span class="Italics">5.7</span>)]<br/>
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of doxycycline in pregnant women. The vast majority of reported experience with doxycycline during human pregnancy is short-term, first trimester exposure. There are no human data available to assess the effects of long-term therapy of doxycycline in pregnant women such as that proposed for the treatment of anthrax exposure. An expert review of published data on experiences with doxycycline use during pregnancy by TERIS - the Teratogen Information System - concluded that therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (the quantity and quality of data were assessed as limited to fair), but the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk.<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p>A case-control study (18,515 mothers of infants with congenital anomalies and 32,804 mothers of infants with no congenital anomalies) shows a weak but marginally statistically significant association with total malformations and use of doxycycline anytime during pregnancy. Sixty-three (0.19%) of the controls and 56 (0.30%) of the cases were treated with doxycycline. This association was not seen when the analysis was confined to maternal treatment during the period of organogenesis (that is, in the second and third months of gestation), with the exception of a marginal relationship with neural tube defect based on only two-exposed cases.<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p>A small prospective study of 81 pregnancies describes 43 pregnant women treated for 10 days with doxycycline during early first trimester. All mothers reported their exposed infants were normal at 1 year of age.<span class="Sup">3</span></p><p>Nonteratogenic effects: [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> (<span class="Italics">5.1, 5.7</span>)].</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk, however, the extent of absorption of tetracyclines including doxycycline, by the breastfed infant is not known. Short-term use by lactating women is not necessarily contraindicated. The effects of prolonged exposure to doxycycline in breast milk are unknown<span class="Sup">4</span>. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from doxycycline, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> (<span class="Italics">5.1, 5.7</span>)].</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Because of the effects of drugs of the tetracycline-class on tooth development and growth, use Acticlate and Acticlate CAP in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening conditions (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), particularly when there are no alternative therapies <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.7) and Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of doxycycline hyclate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Acticlate Tablets each contains less than 1 mg of sodium.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures. Dialysis does not alter serum half-life and thus would not be of benefit in treating cases of overdosage.</p><h2>Acticlate Description</h2><p class="First">Acticlate (doxycycline hyclate) Tablets and Acticlate CAP (doxycycline hyclate) Capsules contain doxycycline hyclate, a tetracycline class drug synthetically derived from oxytetracycline, in an immediate release formulation for oral administration.</p><p>The molecular formula of doxycycline hyclate is (C<span class="Sub">22</span>H<span class="Sub">24</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">8</span> • HCl)<span class="Sub">2</span>• C<span class="Sub">2</span>H<span class="Sub">6</span>O• H<span class="Sub">2</span>O and the molecular weight of doxycycline hyclate is 1025.87.

The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> of doxycycline are 24% and 15% lower, respectively, following single dose administration of Acticlate, 150 mg tablets with a high fat meal (including milk) compared to fasted conditions. The clinical significance of these decreases is unknown.<br/>
Acticlate CAP (doxycycline hyclate) Capsules. Following administration of a single 300 mg dose to adult volunteers, average peak plasma doxycycline levels were 2.8 mcg per mL at 3 hours, decreasing to 1.1 mcg per mL at 24 hours. The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> of doxycycline is approximately 20% lower and the AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> is unchanged following single dose administration of Acticlate CAP Capsules with a high fat meal (including milk) compared to fasted conditions. The clinical significance of this decrease in C<span class="Sub">max</span> is unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span><br/>
Tetracyclines are concentrated in bile by the liver and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically active form.</p><p>Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40% per 72 hours in individuals with a creatinine clearance of about 75 mL per minute. This percentage may fall as low as 1% per 72 hours to 5% per 72 hours in individuals with a creatinine clearance below 10 mL per minute. Studies have shown no significant difference in the serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18 to 22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function. Hemodialysis does not alter the serum half-life.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span><br/>
Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Doxycycline has bacteriostatic activity against a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Resistance</span><br/>
Cross resistance with other tetracyclines is common.<br/>

*Doxycycline has been found to be active against the asexual erythrocytic forms of <span class="Italics">Plasmodium falciparum</span>, but not against the gametocytes of <span class="Italics">P. falciparum</span>. The precise mechanism of action of the drug is not known.</p><p><span class="Bold">Susceptibility Testing Methods</span><br/>
When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative reports of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid in the selection of an appropriate antibacterial drug for treatment.</p><p><span class="Italics">Dilution techniques:</span><br/>
Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs values should be determined using a standardized test method<span class="Sup">5,6,7,8,9</span> (broth and/or agar). The MIC values should be interpreted according to criteria provided in Table 1.</p><p><span class="Italics">Diffusion techniques:</span><br/>
Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters can also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds.</p><p>The zone size should be determined using a standardized test method<span class="Sup">5,7,10</span>. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg doxycycline to test the susceptibility of bacteria to doxycycline. The disk diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 1.</p><p><span class="Italics">Anaerobic Techniques:</span><br/>
For anaerobic bacteria, the susceptibility to doxycycline can be determined by a standardized test method<span class="Sup">5,11</span>. The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 1.</p><p>Doxycycline susceptibility testing interpretive criteria for anaerobes, <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span>, and <span class="Italics">Ureaplasma urealyticum</span> have not been established. Isolates of these species that are susceptible to tetracycline are also considered susceptible to doxycycline.<span class="Sup">5</span></p><p>A report of <span class="Italics">Susceptible (S)</span> indicates that the antimicrobial drug is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial drug reaches the concentration usually achievable at the site of infection. A report of <span class="Italics">Intermediate (I)</span> indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug product is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of <span class="Italics">Resistant (R)</span> indicates that the antimicrobial drug is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial drug reaches the concentration usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected.</p><p><span class="Bold">Quality Control</span><br/>
Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of the supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test<span class="Sup">5,6,7,8,9,10,11</span>. Standard doxycycline powders should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 2. For the diffusion technique using the 30 mcg doxycycline disk, the criteria noted in Table 2 should be achieved.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of Acticlate (doxycycline hyclate) and Acticlate CAP (doxycycline hyclate) have not been conducted.<br/>
However, a 2 year carcinogenicity study with doxycycline administered daily by oral gavage to adult rats (20, 75, 200 mg/kg/day) demonstrated an increase in uterine polyps in female rats at 200 mg/kg/day (10 times the maximum recommended daily adult dose of Acticlate and Acticlate CAP based on body surface area comparison) with no change in tumor incidence in male rats at the same dose. A 2-year carcinogenicity study with doxycycline administered daily by oral gavage to adult male (maximum dose 150 mg/kg/day) and female (maximum dose 300 mg/kg/day) mice showed no changes in tumor incidence, at approximately 4 and 7 times the maximum recommended daily adult dose of Acticlate and Acticlate CAP, based on a body surface area comparison, respectively.</p><p>Mutagenesis and fertility studies have not been conducted with Acticlate and Acticlate CAP. Mutagenesis studies with doxycycline demonstrated no potential to cause genetic toxicity in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> point mutation study with mammalian cells or in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus assay in CD-1 mice. However, data from an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mammalian chromosomal aberration assay conducted in CHO cells suggest that doxycycline is a weak clastogen. Oral administration of doxycycline to Sprague-Dawley rats showed adverse effects on fertility and reproduction including increased time for mating, reduced sperm motility, velocity and concentration as well as increased pre and post implantation loss. Reduced sperm velocity was seen at the lowest dosage tested, 50 mg/kg/day which is 2.5 times the maximum recommended daily adult dose of Acticlate and Acticlate CAP. Although doxycycline impairs the fertility of rats when administered at sufficient dosages, the effect of Acticlate and Acticlate CAP on human fertility is unknown.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Hyperpigmentation of the thyroid has been produced by members of the tetracycline-class in the following species: in rats by oxytetracycline, doxycycline, tetracycline PO<span class="Sub">4</span>, and methacycline; in minipigs by doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline PO<span class="Sub">4</span>, and methacycline; in dogs by doxycycline and minocycline; in monkeys by minocycline.</p><p>Minocycline, tetracycline PO<span class="Sub">4</span>, methacycline, doxycycline, tetracycline base, oxytetracycline HCl, and tetracycline HCl, were goitrogenic in rats fed a low iodine diet. This goitrogenic effect was accompanied by high radioactive iodine uptake. Administration of minocycline also produced a large goiter with high radioiodine uptake in rats fed a relatively high iodine diet.</p><p>Treatment of various animal species with this class of drugs has also resulted in the induction of thyroid hyperplasia in the following: in rats and dogs (minocycline); in chickens (chlortetracycline); and in rats and mice (oxytetracycline). Adrenal gland hyperplasia has been observed in goats and rats treated with oxytetracycline.</p><p>Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta and are found in fetal tissues.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">How Supplied</span></p><p>Acticlate (doxycycline hyclate) Tablets, 75 mg are round, convex, light-teal, film-coated, tablets with “75” debossed on one side of the tablet and “AQ101” debossed on the other.

Advise patients taking Acticlate and Acticlate CAP for malaria prophylaxis:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>that no present-day antimalarial agent, including doxycycline, guarantees protection against malaria.</li>
<li>to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using personal protective measures that help avoid contact with mosquitoes, especially from dusk to dawn (for example, staying in well-screened areas, using mosquito nets, covering the body with clothing, and using an effective insect repellent).</li>
<li>that doxycycline prophylaxis:<br/>
- should begin 1 day to 2 days before travel to the malarious area,<br/>
- should be continued daily while in the malarious area and after leaving the malarious area,<br/>
- should be continued for 4 further weeks to avoid development of malaria after returning from an endemic area,<br/>
- should not exceed 4 months.<br/>
Advise all patients taking Acticlate and Acticlate CAP:</li>
<li>that Acticlate Tablets (150 mg) can be broken into two-thirds or one-third at the scored lines to provide 100 mg or 50 mg strength doses, respectively.</li>
<li>that they must swallow Acticlate CAP whole. They must not break, open, crush, dissolve or chew the capsule [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span>].</li>
<li>to avoid excessive sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light while receiving doxycycline and to discontinue therapy if phototoxicity (for example, skin eruptions, etc.) occurs. Sunscreen or sunblock should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</li>
<li>to drink fluids liberally along with Acticlate and Acticlate CAP to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</li>
<li>that the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taken with foods, especially those that contain calcium <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>. However, the absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</li>
<li>that if gastric irritation occurs, Acticlate and Acticlate CAP may be given with food or milk <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</li>
<li>that the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taken with antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium, bismuth subsalicylate, and iron-containing preparations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</li>
<li>that the use of doxycycline might increase the incidence of vaginal candidiasis.</li>
</ul><p>Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><p>Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including Acticlate and Acticlate CAP should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (for example, the common cold). When Acticlate and Acticlate CAP are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Acticlate and Acticlate CAP or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Manufactured by Catalent Pharma Solutions, Winchester, KY 40391<br/>
