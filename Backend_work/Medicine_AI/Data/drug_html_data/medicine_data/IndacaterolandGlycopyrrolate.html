Indacaterol/glycopyrrolate is not indicated for the treatment of asthma. Available data do not suggest an increased risk of death with use of an LABA in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p><p>• Bronchospasm: Paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening may occur with use of inhaled bronchodilating agents; this should be distinguished from inadequate response. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue use and institute alternative therapy.</p><p>• CNS effects: May cause drowsiness, dizziness, and/or blurred vision; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks which require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving).</p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, rash, or urticaria, may occur; discontinue immediately if signs/symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction occur.</p><p>• Serious effects/fatalities: Do not exceed recommended dose or frequency or use with other medications containing LABAs; serious adverse events, including fatalities, have been associated with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetics.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (eg, arrhythmia, coronary insufficiency, hypertension); beta-agonists may cause elevation in blood pressure and heart rate. Beta-2 agonists may also produce changes in the ECG (eg, T-wave flattening, QTc prolongation, ST segment depression).</p><p>• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus; beta-2 agonists may aggravate preexisting diabetes and ketoacidosis and increase serum glucose.</p><p>• Glaucoma: Use with caution in patients with narrow angle glaucoma; may increase intraocular pressure.</p><p>• Hyperthyroidism: Use with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism; beta-2 agonists may stimulate thyroid activity.</p><p>• Hypokalemia: Use with caution in patients with hypokalemia; beta-2 agonists may decrease serum potassium (transient).</p><p>• Renal function impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR &lt;30 mL/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis; monitor closely.</p><p>• Seizures: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders; beta-2 agonists may result in CNS stimulation/excitation.</p><p>• Urinary retention: Use with caution in patients with urinary retention. Monitor for signs and symptoms of urinary retention, especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction.</p><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Pediatric: LABAs, when used as monotherapy, may increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. When LABAs are used in a fixed-dose combination with inhaled corticosteroids, data from large clinical trials in adolescents do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared to inhaled corticosteroids alone.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Lactose: Some products may contain lactose; allergic reactions possible in patients with severe milk protein allergy. Use with caution in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Not indicated for the initial (rescue) treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm or with acutely deteriorating or potentially life-threatening COPD; after initiation of therapy, patients should use short-acting bronchodilators only on an as needed basis for acute symptoms.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>FEV<sub>1</sub>, peak flow, and/or other pulmonary function tests; serum potassium, serum glucose; blood pressure, heart rate; CNS stimulation; signs/symptoms of glaucoma; hypersensitivity reactions; urinary retention.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
