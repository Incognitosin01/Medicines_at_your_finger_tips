<li>Ilumya was FDA approved in 2018  and Skyrizi was FDA approved in 2019.</li>
<li>Ilyumya is a brand name for tildrakizumab and Skyrizi is a brand name for risankizumab</li>
<li>The dose of Skyrizi is 150mg, but because each injection only contains 75mg, two injections must be given per dose. The dose of Ilumya is 100mg, and each injection contains 100mg therefore only one injection needs to be given each time</li>
<li>Ilumya needs to be administered by a healthcare professional; however, patients prescribed Skyrizi can be taught how to self-administer it at home.</li>
