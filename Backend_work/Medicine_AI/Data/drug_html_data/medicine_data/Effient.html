An unwanted blood clot can occur with certain heart or blood vessel conditions.</p><p>Effient is used to prevent blood clots in people with acute coronary syndrome who are undergoing a procedure after a recent heart attack.</p><p>Effient may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not take Effient if you have active bleeding such as a stomach ulcer or bleeding in the brain, if you have ever had a stroke or "mini-stroke", or if you are scheduled to have surgery, especially heart bypass surgery.</p><p><b>Effient increases your risk of bleeding, which can be severe or life-threatening.</b> Call your doctor or seek emergency medical attention if you have bleeding that will not stop, if you have black or bloody stools, or if you cough up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.</p><p>You may need to stop using the medicine for a short time before any surgery or dental treatment. Do not stop taking Effient unless your doctor tells you to.</p><p>While you are taking Effient, do not take NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) without your doctor's advice. NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), diclofenac (Voltaren), diflunisal (Dolobid), etodolac (Lodine), flurbiprofen (Ansaid), indomethacin (Indocin), ketoprofen (Orudis), ketorolac (Toradol), mefenamic acid (Ponstel), meloxicam (Mobic), nabumetone (Relafen), piroxicam (Feldene), and others.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Effient if you are allergic to prasugrel, or if you have:</p><ul>

Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Effient can be taken with or without food.</p><p>If you also take aspirin, follow your doctor's instructions about how much aspirin to take and for how long.</p><p>Because Effient keeps your blood from clotting, <b>this medicine can also make it easier for you to bleed, even from a minor injury such as a fall or a bump on the head.</b> Seek emergency medical attention if you have any bleeding that will not stop.</p><p>If you need surgery or dental work, tell the surgeon or dentist ahead of time that you are using Effient.
