</ul><h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2><p class="First">Podocon-25® is composed of Podophyllin (Podophyllum Resin, American) 25% in Benzoin Tincture. Podophyllum Resin is the powdered mixture of resins removed from the May apple or Mandrake (<span class="Italics">PodophyllumpeltatumLinne’</span> ), a perennial plant of northern and middle United States<span class="Sup">(1)</span>. The podophyllin resin used in this product is exclusively the American podophyllin (rather than the Indian resin). American podophyllin typically has a reduced level of podophyllotoxin (see below).</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">Podophyllin is a cytotoxic agent that has been used topically in the treatment of genital warts. It arrests mitosis in metaphase, an effect it shares with other cytotoxic agents such as the vinca alkaloids<span class="Sup">(2)</span>. The active agent is podophyllotoxin, whose concentration varies with the type of podophyllin used; the American source normally containing one-fourth the amount of podophyllotoxin as the Indian source<span class="Sup">(3)</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">NOTE: Podocon-25</span>® <span class="Bold">IS TO BE APPLIED ONLY BY A PHYSICIAN. IT IS NOT TO BE DISPENSED TO THE PATIENT.</span></p><h2>INDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Podocon-25® (25% podophyllin in benzoin tincture) is indicated for the removal of soft genital (venereal) warts (condylomata acuminata)<span class="Sup">(4)</span>.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Podocon-25® is contraindicated in diabetics, patients using steroids or with poor blood circulation.

It is recommended that Podocon- 25® not be used during pregnancy (see Pregnancy warning below).</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First">Podophyllin is a powerful caustic and severe irritant.
