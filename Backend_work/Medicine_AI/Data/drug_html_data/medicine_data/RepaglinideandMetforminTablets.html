</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Lactic Acidosis</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">There have been post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis.</span></p><p>Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (&gt;5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally &gt;5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.</p><p>If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets.</p><p>In repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.</p><p>Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.</p><p>For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></span> </p><p>The post-marketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Before initiating repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).</span></li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span><span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].</span></span></li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Initiation of repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>.</span></li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.</span></li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">In patients taking repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy<span class="Italics">.</span></span></li>
</ul><p> <span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span></span></span></p><p> <span class="following_xmChange">The concomitant use of repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation <span class="Italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].</span> Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients.</span> </p><p> <span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Age 65 or Greater</span></span></span></p><p>The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients <span class="Italics">[see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.5)].</span></p><p> <span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Radiological Studies with Contrast</span> </span></span></p><p> <span class="following_xmChange">Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast.

Repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hypoxic States</span></span></p><p>Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Excessive Alcohol Intake</span></span></p><p>Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></span></p><p>Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.</p><h3>Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">All glinides, including repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets, can cause hypoglycemia [<span class="Italics">see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]</span>. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening, or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery).</p><p>Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) <span class="Italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)],</span> or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.</p><p>Factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content), changes in level of physical activity, changes to co-administered medication <span class="Italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]</span>, and concomitant use with other antidiabetic agents. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6, 8.7)]</span>.</p><p>Patients should administer repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets before meals and be instructed to skip the dose of repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets if a meal is skipped. In patients who experience hypoglycemia, the dose of repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be reduced <span class="Italics">[see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1)]</span>. Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.</p><h3>Vitamin B12 Levels</h3><p class="First">In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks' duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. This finding, possibly due to interference with B<span class="Sub">12</span> absorption from the B<span class="Sub">12</span>-intrinsic factor complex, is rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed.</p><p>Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> measurements at 2- to 3- year intervals may be useful.</p><h3>Serious Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Use with NPH-insulin</h3><p class="First">Across seven controlled trials, there were six serious adverse events of myocardial ischemia in patients treated with repaglanide plus NPH-insulin from two studies, and one event in patients using insulin formulations alone from another study <span class="Italics">[see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].</span> repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets is not indicated for use in combination with NPH-insulin.</p><h3>Macrovascular Outcomes</h3><p class="First">There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Lactic acidosis <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]</span></li>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>Repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets was administered to 374 patients with type 2 diabetes during clinical trials. Table 1 summarizes the most common adverse reactions occurring in a 6-month randomized trial of repaglinide as add-on therapy to metformin in patients inadequately controlled on metformin alone.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hypoglycemia</span></span></p><p>In clinical trials with repaglinide, hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction. Mild or moderate hypoglycemia occurred in 31% of repaglinide treated patients and 7% of placebo treated patients.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions</span></span></p><p>Gastrointestinal reactions (e.g., diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) are the most common adverse reactions (&gt; 5%) with metformin treatment and are more frequent at higher metformin doses.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Weight Gain</span></span></p><p>In a clinical trial, 83 patients were randomized to add-on repaglinide, repaglinide monotherapy, or continued treatment with metformin monotherapy. A statistically significant weight gain was observed for the combination of repaglinide and metformin in a pairwise comparison with metformin monotherapy (see Table 2).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular Events in repaglinide monotherapy trials</span></span></p><p>The incidence of total serious cardiovascular adverse events, including ischemia, was higher for repaglinide (51/1228 or 4%) than for sulfonylurea drugs (13/498 or 3%) in controlled clinical trials.</p><p>Seven controlled clinical trials included repaglinide combination therapy with NPH-insulin (n=431), insulin formulations alone (n=388) or other combinations (sulfonylurea plus NPH-insulin or repaglinide plus metformin ) (n=120). There were six serious adverse events of myocardial ischemia in patients treated with repaglinide plus NPH-insulin (1.4%) from two studies, and one event in patients using insulin formulations alone from another study (0.3%) <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)].</span></p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Repaglinide</span></span></p><p>Alopecia, hemolytic anemia, pancreatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and severe hepatic dysfunction including jaundice and hepatitis.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metformin</span></span></p><p>Cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Table 3 includes a list of drugs with clinically important drug interactions when administered concomitantly with repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets and instructions for preventing or managing them.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category C.</span></span></p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets or its individual components. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets like other antidiabetic medications, should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p>No animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets. The following data are based on findings in studies performed with repaglinide or metformin individually.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Repaglinide</span></span></p><p>Repaglinide was not teratogenic in rats at doses 40 times, and rabbits approximately 0.8 times the clinical exposure (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) throughout pregnancy. Offspring of rat dams exposed to repaglinide at 15 times clinical exposure on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis during days 17 to 22 of gestation and during lactation developed nonteratogenic skeletal deformities consisting of shortening, thickening, and bending of the humerus during the postnatal period. This effect was not seen at doses up to 2.5 times clinical exposure (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) on days 1 to 22 of pregnancy or at higher doses given during days 1 to 16 of pregnancy. Relevant human exposure has not occurred to date and therefore the safety of repaglinide administration throughout pregnancy or lactation cannot be established.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metformin</span></span></p><p>Metformin alone was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of approximately two and six times the near-maximal efficacious human daily dose of 2000 mg of the metformin component of repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">No studies in lactating animals have been conducted with the repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets fixed dose combination. In studies performed with individual components, both repaglinide and metformin are excreted into milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether repaglinide or metformin are excreted in human milk. Repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets are not recommended in nursing mothers because it may potentially cause hypoglycemia in nursing infants.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Repaglinide</span></span></p><p>In rat reproduction studies, measurable levels of repaglinide were detected in the breast milk of the dams and lowered blood glucose levels were observed in the pups. Cross fostering studies indicated that skeletal changes could be induced in control pups nursed by treated dams, although this occurred to a lesser degree than those pups treated in utero.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metformin</span></span></p><p>Studies in lactating rats with metformin show that it is excreted into milk and reaches levels comparable to those in plasma.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1), CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>. <span class="Italics">[see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2), CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. Repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Repaglinide</span></p><p>Severe hypoglycemic reactions with coma, seizure, or other neurological impairment may occur and constitute medical emergencies requiring immediate hospitalization. Hypoglycemic symptoms without loss of consciousness or neurologic findings should be treated aggressively with oral glucose and adjustments in drug dosage and/or meal patterns. Close monitoring may continue until the physician is assured that the patient is out of danger. Patients should be closely monitored for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours, since hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. There is no evidence that repaglinide is dialyzable using hemodialysis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metformin</span></p><p>Overdose of metformin has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].</span> Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected.</p><h2>Repaglinide and Metformin Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets for oral use contain repaglinide, a glinide, and metformin, a biguanide.</p><p>Repaglinide, S(+)2-ethoxy-4(2((3-methyl-1-(2-(1-piperidinyl) phenyl)-butyl) amino)-2-oxoethyl) benzoic acid, is chemically unrelated to the oral sulfonylurea insulin secretagogues.

Iron oxide yellow is present in the 1 mg/500 mg repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets. Iron oxide red and propylene glycol are present in the 2 mg/500 mg repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets.</p><h2>Repaglinide and Metformin Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Repaglinide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets</span></span></p><p>Repaglinide lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas. This action is dependent upon functioning beta (β) cells in the pancreatic islets.</p><p>Repaglinide closes ATP-dependent potassium channels in the β-cell membrane by binding at characterizable sites. This potassium channel blockade depolarizes the β -cell, which leads to an opening of calcium channels. The resulting increased calcium influx induces insulin secretion. The ion channel mechanism is highly tissue selective with low affinity for heart and skeletal muscle.</p><p>Metformin improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes by lowering both the basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Repaglinide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets</span></span></p><p>The pharmacokinetic profiles of repaglinide and metformin from repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets doses are listed in Table 4 below. The results of a pharmacokinetic</p><p>single-dose crossover study in healthy subjects demonstrated that repaglinide has dose proportional pharmacokinetics (AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) for the combination of repaglinide/metformin in repaglinide and metformin hydrochloride tablets (2 mg/500 mg and 1 mg/500 mg).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption and Bioavailability:</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Repaglinide</span></p><p>After single and multiple oral doses in healthy subjects or in patients with type 2 diabetes, peak plasma drug levels (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) occur within 1 hour (T<span class="Sub">max</span>). Repaglinide is eliminated from the blood stream with a half-life of approximately 1 hour. The mean absolute bioavailability is 56%. When repaglinide was given with food, the mean T<span class="Sub">max</span> was not changed, but the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC (area under the time/plasma concentration curve) were decreased 20% and 12.4%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metformin</span></p><p>The absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg metformin tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin tablets of 500 mg to 1,500 mg, and 850 mg to 2,550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower peak concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>), a 25% lower area under plasma concentration (AUC) and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) following administration of a single 850 mg tablet of metformin with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Distribution:</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Repaglinide</span></p><p>After intravenous (IV) dosing in healthy subjects, the volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was 31 L, and the total body clearance (CL) was 38 L/h. Protein binding and binding to human serum albumin was greater than 98%.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metformin</span></p><p>The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral dose of 850 mg averaged 654 ± 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally &lt; 1 mcg/mL. During controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 mcg/mL, even at maximum doses.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Elimination:</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Repaglinide</span></p><p>Repaglinide is completely metabolized by oxidative biotransformation and direct conjugation with glucuronic acid after either an intravenous or oral dose. The major metabolites are an oxidized dicarboxylic acid (M2), the aromatic amine (M1), and the acyl glucuronide (M7). The cytochrome P-450 enzyme system, specifically 2C8 and 3A4, have been shown to be involved in the N-dealkylation of repaglinide to M2 and the further oxidation to M1. Metabolites do not contribute to the glucose-lowering effect of repaglinide. Within 96 hours after dosing with <span class="Sup">14</span>C-repaglinide as a single, oral dose, approximately 90% of the radiolabel was recovered in the feces and approximately 8% in the urine. Only 0.1% of the dose is cleared in the urine as parent compound. The major metabolite (M2) accounted for 60% of the administered dose. Less than 2% of parent drug was recovered in feces. Repaglinide appears to be a substrate for active hepatic uptake transporter (organic anion transporting protein OATP1B1).</p><p><span class="Italics">Metformin</span></p><p>Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) or biliary excretion. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Specific Populations:</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Repaglinide:</span></p><p>Single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics of repaglinide were compared between patients with type 2 diabetes and normal renal function (CrCl &gt; 80 mL/min), mild to moderate renal function impairment (CrCl = 40 to 80 mL/min), and severe renal function impairment (CrCl = 20 to 40 mL/min). Both AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of repaglinide were similar in patients with normal and mild to moderately impaired renal function (mean values 56.7 ng/mL*hr vs 57.2 ng/mL*hr and 37.5 ng/mL vs 37.7 ng/mL, respectively). Patients with severely reduced renal function had elevated mean AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> values (98.0 ng/mL*hr and 50.7 ng/mL, respectively), but this study showed only a weak correlation between repaglinide levels and creatinine clearance.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metformin:</span></p><p>In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Repaglinide:</span></p><p>A single-dose, open-label study was conducted in 12 healthy subjects and 12 patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) classified by Child-Pugh scale and caffeine clearance.
