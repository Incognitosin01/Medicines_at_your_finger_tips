Latanoprost is absorbed through the cornea and hydrolyzed to the biologically active acid (measurable in the aqueous humor during the first 4 hours and in the plasma during the first hour).</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Latanoprost: V<sub>d</sub>: 0.16 ± 0.02 L/kg</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Latanoprost: Isopropyl ester prodrug is hydrolyzed to the biologically active acid in the cornea. Biologically active acid reaching systemic circulation is primarily metabolized hepatically via fatty acid beta-oxidation.</p><p>Netarsudil: Metabolized by ophthalmic esterases to active metabolite, AR-13503</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Latanoprost: Urine: ~88% (as metabolites)</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Latanoprost: 17 minutes</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Elevated intraocular pressure:</b> Reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>There are no contraindications listed in the manufacturer's labeling.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Elevated intraocular pressure:</b> Ophthalmic: One drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening (maximum: 1 drop in affected eye(s) once daily).</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Ophthalmic: May be used with other eye drops to lower IOP. If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, administer the drugs at least 5 minutes apart. Remove contact lenses prior to administration and wait 15 minutes before reinserting. Avoid touching the dropper tip with fingers, eyes, eyelids, or surrounding areas to minimize contamination of the dropper tip.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). May be stored at 2°C to 25°C (36°F to 77°F) after opening for up to 6 weeks; if stored under refrigeration after opening, product can be used until expiration date. Protect from light. May be maintained at temperatures up to 40°C (104°F) for up to 14 days during shipment.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Bimatoprost: The concomitant use of Latanoprost and Bimatoprost may result in increased intraocular pressure. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Prostaglandins (Ophthalmic). Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents may also enhance the therapeutic effects of Prostaglandins (Ophthalmic).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (Ophthalmic): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Prostaglandins (Ophthalmic).

Pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent although iris color change may not be noticeable for months to years; pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes may be reversible following discontinuation of therapy. Long-term consequences and potential injury to eye are not known.</p><p>• Ocular inflammation: Intraocular inflammation and exacerbation of inflammation may occur; use with caution in patients with a history of intraocular inflammation (eg, iritis/uveitis) and generally avoid use in patients with active intraocular inflammation.</p><p><i><b>Disease-related concerns:</b></i></p><p>• Herpetic keratitis: Use with caution in patients with a history of herpes simplex keratitis; reactivation may occur. Avoid use in patients with active herpes simplex keratitis.</p><p>• Ocular disease: Use with caution in aphakic patients, pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or patients with risk factors for macular edema. Safety and efficacy have not been determined for use in patients with angle-closure, inflammatory, or neovascular glaucoma.</p><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Contact lens wearers: Solution contains benzalkonium chloride which may be absorbed by contact lenses. Remove contacts prior to administration and wait 15 minutes before reinserting.</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• Appropriate use: Avoid concurrent use of 2 or more prostaglandins or prostaglandin analogs or more frequent administration than once daily; may decrease the IOP lowering effect or cause paradoxical elevations in IOP.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor IOP; regularly examine patients who develop increased iris pigmentation.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Systemic absorption is limited following ophthalmic application.</p><p>If ophthalmic agents are needed during pregnancy, the minimum effective dose should be used in combination with punctal occlusion to decrease potential exposure to the fetus (Samples 1988). Also refer to individual monographs.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat glaucoma.</p><p>• It is used to lower high eye pressure.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
