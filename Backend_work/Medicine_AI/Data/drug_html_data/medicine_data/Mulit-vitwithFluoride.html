</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Active ingredient for caries prophylaxis:<br/></span> Each 1 mL contains 0.25 mg fluoride as sodium fluoride.</p><h3>Other ingredients:</h3><p class="First">ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), caramel color, cholecalciferol (Vitamin D<span class="Sub">3</span>), cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>), dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E), ferrous sulfate, flavors, glycerin, niacinamide, polysorbate 80, purified water, pyridoxine hydrochloride (Vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span>), riboflavin 5’-phosphate sodium (Vitamin B<span class="Sub">2</span>), sodium hydroxide, thiamine hydrochloride (Vitamin B<span class="Sub">1</span>), vitamin A palmitate</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the <span class="Italics">hydroxyapatite</span> in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, <span class="Italics">fluorapatite</span>. Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished:<span class="Sup">1</span> 1) Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. 2) After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. 3) After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from water, food, supplementary fluoride, and smaller amounts from saliva.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First">Supplementation of the diet with nine essential vitamins. Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxis. MULTI-VIT with FLUORIDE 0.25 mg drops were developed to provide fluoride in drop form for infants and young children from 6 months to 3 years of age in areas where the drinking water contains less than 0.3 ppm of fluoride and for children ages 3 to 6 years in areas where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride.<span class="Sup">2, 3</span> Each 1 mL supplies sodium fluoride (0.25 mg fluoride) plus nine essential vitamins. MULTI-VIT with FLUORIDE 0.25 mg drops supply significant amounts of vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span> and vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, infants and children obtain nine essential vitamins plus fluoride.</p><h2>WARNING:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">As with all medicines, keep out of the reach of children.</span></p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">The suggested dose should not be exceeded since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. When prescribing MULTI-VIT with FLUORIDE 0.25 mg drops: 1) Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water from all major sources. 2) Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other sourcessuch as medications and swallowed toothpaste. 3) Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis. MULTI-VIT with FLUORIDE 0.25 mg drops should be dispensed in the original plastic container, since contact with glass leads to instability and precipitation. (The amount of sodium fluoride in a 50-mL size is well below the maximum to be dispensed at one time according to recommendations of the American Dental Association.)</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Allergic rash and other idiosyncrasies have been rarely reported.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First">1 mL daily, or as prescribed. May be dropped directly into mouth with dropper, or mixed with fruit juice, cereal or other food. <span class="Bold">USE FULL DOSAGE.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">DISPENSE</span> in original container.</p><p class="First">Occasional deepening of color has no significant effect on vitamin potency.</p><p>After opening, store away from direct light.</p><p><span class="Bold">Your doctor or dentist is the best source of counsel and guidance in your child’s fluoride supplementation.</span></p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">Manufactured for:<br/>
