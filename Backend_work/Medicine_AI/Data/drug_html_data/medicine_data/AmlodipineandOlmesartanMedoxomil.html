</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil</h2><p class="First">Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets.<br/>
<br/>
Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).<br/>
<br/>
Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.<br/>
<br/>
Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.<br/>
<br/>
Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.<br/>
<br/>
Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals.<br/>
<br/>
Patients with moderate or severe hypertension are at relatively high risk for cardiovascular events (such as strokes, heart attacks, and heart failure), kidney failure, and vision problems, so prompt treatment is clinically relevant. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and should be shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient’s risk.<br/>
<br/>
Data from an 8-week, placebo-controlled, parallel-group factorial study [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14.1)</span>] provide estimates of the probability of reaching a blood pressure goal with amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil tablets compared to amlodipine or olmesartan medoxomil monotherapy. The figures below provide estimates of the likelihood of achieving the targeted systolic or diastolic blood pressure goals with Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets 10/40 mg compared with amlodipine or olmesartan medoxomil monotherapy, based upon baseline systolic or diastolic blood pressure. The curve of each treatment group was estimated by logistic regression modeling from all available data of that treatment group. The right tail of each curve is less reliable because of small numbers of subjects with high baseline blood pressures.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Probability of Achieving Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) &lt; 140 mmHg at Week 8 With LOCF</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2: Probability of Achieving Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) &lt; 90 mmHg at Week 8 With LOCF</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 3: Probability of Achieving Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) &lt; 130 mmHg at Week 8 With LOCF</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 4: Probability of Achieving Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) &lt; 80 mmHg at Week 8 With LOCF</span></p><p>The figures above provide an approximation of the likelihood of reaching a targeted blood pressure goal (e.g., Week 8 SBP &lt; 140 mmHg or &lt; 130 mmHg or a DBP &lt; 90 mmHg or &lt;80 mmHg) for the high-dose treatment groups evaluated in the study. Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets 5/20 mg, the lowest dose combination treatment group, increases the probability of reaching blood pressure goal compared with the highest dose monotherapies, amlodipine 10 mg and olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a patient with a baseline blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg has about a 48% likelihood of achieving a goal of &lt; 140 mmHg (systolic) and a 51% likelihood of achieving a goal of &lt; 90 mmHg (diastolic) on monotherapy with olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg, and about a 46% likelihood of achieving a goal of &lt; 140 mmHg (systolic) and a 60% likelihood of achieving a goal of &lt; 90 mmHg (diastolic) on monotherapy with amlodipine 10 mg. The likelihood of achieving these same goals increases to 63% (systolic) and 71% (diastolic) on Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets 5/20 mg, and to 68% (systolic) and 85% (diastolic) on Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets 10/40 mg.</p><h2>Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The usual starting dose of Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets is 5/20 mg once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum dose of one 10/40 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14.1)</span>].</p><p>Dosage may be increased after 2 weeks. The maximum recommended dose of Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets is 10/40 mg.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets are formulated for oral administration in the following strength combinations:</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Do not co-administer aliskiren with Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets in patients with diabetes [<span class="Italics">See Drug Interactions (7.2)</span>].</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Fetal toxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category D<br/></span><br/>
Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil as soon as possible [<span class="Italics">See Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>].</p><h3>Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil.</span></span> In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics) Symptomatic hypotension may be anticipated after initiation of treatment with olmesartan medoxomil. Initiate treatment with Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets under close medical supervision. If hypotension does occur, place the patient in the supine position and, if necessary, give an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Amlodipine.</span></span> Symptomatic hypotension is possible, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis.Because of the gradual onset of action, acute hypotension is unlikely.</p><h3>Increased Angina or Myocardial Infarction</h3><p class="First"><span class="And Bold Italics">Amlodipine.</span> Patients, particularly those with severe obstructive coronary artery disease, may develop increased frequency, duration, or severity of angina or acute myocardial infarction on starting calcium channel blocker therapy or at the time of dosage increase. The mechanism of this effect has not been elucidated.</p><h3>Impaired Renal Function</h3><p class="First"><span class="And Bold Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> Changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with olmesartan medoxomil as a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar effects may occur in patients treated with Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets because of the olmesartan medoxomil component[<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p>In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been reported. There has been no long-term use of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar effects would be expected with olmesartan medoxomil and Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets.</p><h3>Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Amlodipine.</span></span> Patients with hepatic impairment have decreased clearance of amlodipine. Starting amlodipine or adding amlodipine at 2.5 mg in hepatically impaired patients is recommended. The lowest dose of Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets is 5/20 mg; therefore, initial therapy with Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets is not recommended in hepatically impaired patients <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</span></p><p>Since amlodipine is extensively metabolized by the liver and the plasma elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) is 56 hours in patients with severely impaired hepatic function, titrate slowly when administering to patients with severe hepatic impairment.</p><h3>Sprue-like Enteropathy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil.</span></span> Severe, chronic diarrhea with substantial weight loss has been reported in patients taking olmesartan months to years after drug initiation. Intestinal biopsies of patients often demonstrated villous atrophy. If a patient develops these symptoms during treatment with olmesartan, exclude other etiologies. Consider discontinuation of Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets in cases where no other etiology is identified.</p><h3>Electrolyte Imbalances</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="And Bold Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil.</span>Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets contain olmesartan, a drug that inhibits the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).

<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><br/>
Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets</span></span><br/>
The data described below reflect exposure to Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets in more than 1600 patients including more than 1000 exposed for at least 6 months and more than 700 exposed for 1 year. Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets were studied in one placebo-controlled factorial trial [<span class="Italics">See Clinical Trials (14.1)</span>]. The population had a mean age of 54 years and included approximately 55% males. Seventy-one percent were Caucasian and 25% were Black. Patients received doses ranging from 5/20 mg to 10/40 mg orally once daily.<br/>
The overall incidence of adverse reactions on therapy with Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets were similar to that seen with corresponding doses of the individual components of Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets, and to placebo. The reported adverse reactions were generally mild and seldom led to discontinuation of treatment (2.6% for Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets and 6.8% for placebo).<br/>
<span class="And Italics Underline"><br/>
Edema</span><br/>
Edema is a known, dose-dependent adverse effect of amlodipine but not of olmesartan medoxomil.<br/>
<br/>
The placebo-subtracted incidence of edema during the 8-week, randomized, double-blind treatment period was highest with amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy. The incidence was significantly reduced when 20 mg or 40 mg of olmesartan medoxomil was added to the 10 mg amlodipine dose.</p><p><br/>
Across all treatment groups, the frequency of edema was generally higher in women than men, as has been observed in previous studies of amlodipine.<br/>
<br/>
There was a greater decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit in patients treated with Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets as compared to patients receiving either component.<br/></p><p>Adverse reactions seen at lower rates during the double-blind period also occurred in the patients treated with Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets at about the same or greater incidence as in patients receiving placebo. These included hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, rash, pruritus, palpitation, urinary frequency, and nocturia.</p><p>The adverse event profile obtained from 44 weeks of open-label combination therapy with amlodipine plus olmesartan medoxomil was similar to that observed during the 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled period.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Initial Therapy</span><br/>
Analyzing the data described above specifically for initial therapy, it was observed that higher doses of Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets caused slightly more hypotension and orthostatic symptoms, but not at the recommended starting dose of Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets 5/20 mg. No increase in the incidence of syncope or near syncope was observed. The incidences of discontinuation because of any treatment emergent adverse events in the double blind phase are summarized in the table below.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Amlodipine</span><br/>
Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine (N=1730) in doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N=1250), discontinuation of amlodipine due to adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of amlodipine-treated patients and about 1% of placebo-treated patients. The most common side effects were headache and edema. The incidence (%) of dose-related side effects was as follows:</p><p>For several adverse experiences that appear to be drug- and dose-related, there was a greater incidence in women than men associated with amlodipine treatment as shown in the following table:</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil.</span><br/>
Olmesartan medoxomil has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. This experience included about 900 patients treated for at least 6 months and more than 525 treated for at least 1 year. Treatment with olmesartan medoxomil was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to that seen with placebo. Events were generally mild, transient, and without relationship to the dose of olmesartan medoxomil.<br/>
<br/>
The overall frequency of adverse events was not dose-related. Analysis of gender, age, and race groups demonstrated no differences between olmesartan medoxomil- and placebo-treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse events in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% (i.e., 79/3278) of patients treated with olmesartan medoxomil and 2.7% (i.e., 32/1179) of control patients. In placebo-controlled trials, the only adverse event that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with olmesartan medoxomil and at a higher incidence in olmesartan medoxomil treated patients vs. placebo was dizziness (3% vs 1%).</p><h3>Post-Marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of the individual components of Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.<br/>
<span class="Bold Italics"><br/>
Amlodipine.</span> The following post-marketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In post-marketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine. Postmarketing reporting has also revealed a possible association between extrapyramidal disorder and amlodipine.<br/>
<span class="Bold Italics"><br/>
Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> The following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing experience:</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole:</span> asthenia, angioedema, anaphylactic reactions, peripheral edema</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> vomiting, diarrhea, sprue-like enteropathy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders:</span> hyperkalemia</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> rhabdomyolysis</p><p><span class="Italics">Urogenital System:</span> acute renal failure, increased blood creatinine levels</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Appendages:</span> alopecia, pruritus, urticaria </p><p>Data from one controlled trial and an epidemiologic study have suggested that high-dose olmesartan may increase cardiovascular (CV) risk in diabetic patients, but the overall data are not conclusive. The randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind ROADMAP trial (Randomized Olmesartan And Diabetes MicroAlbuminuria Prevention trial, n=4447) examined the use of olmesartan, 40 mg daily, vs. placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, normoalbuminuria, and at least one additional risk factor for CV disease. The trial met its primary endpoint, delayed onset of microalbuminuria, but olmesartan had no beneficial effect on decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). There was a finding of increased CV mortality (adjudicated sudden cardiac death, fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, revascularization death) in the olmesartan group compared to the placebo group (15 olmesartan vs. 3 placebo, HR 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4, 17), but the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction was lower with olmesartan (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.35, 1.18).<br/>
<br/>
The epidemiologic study included patients 65 years and older with overall exposure of &gt; 300,000 patient-years. In the sub-group of diabetic patients receiving high-dose olmesartan (40 mg/d) for &gt; 6 months, there appeared to be an increased risk of death (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1, 3.8) compared to similar patients taking other angiotensin receptor blockers. In contrast, high-dose olmesartan use in non-diabetic patients appeared to be associated with a decreased risk of death (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24, 0.86) compared to similar patients taking other angiotensin receptor blockers. No differences were observed between the groups receiving lower doses of olmesartan compared to other angiotensin blockers or those receiving therapy for &lt; 6 months.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, these data raise a concern of a possible increased CV risk associated with the use of high-dose olmesartan in diabetic patients. There are, however, concerns with the credibility of the finding of increased CV risk, notably the observation in the large epidemiologic study for a survival benefit in non-diabetics of a magnitude similar to the adverse finding in diabetics.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drug Interactions with Amlodipine</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Simvastatin:</span> Co-administration of simvastatin with amlodipine increases the systemic exposure of simvastatin.

<br/>
Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus.<br/>
<br/>
In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia [<span class="Italics">See Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span><br/>
<span class="Bold Italics"><br/>
Olmesartan</span> No teratogenic effects were observed when olmesartan medoxomil was administered to pregnant rats at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (240 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) or pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 1 mg/kg/day (half the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis; higher doses could not be evaluated for effects on fetal development as they were lethal to the does). In rats, significant decreases in pup birth weight and weight gain were observed at doses ≥ 1.6 mg/kg/day, and delays in developmental milestones (delayed separation of ear auricular, eruption of lower incisors, appearance of abdominal hair, descent of testes, and separation of eyelids) and dose-dependent increases in the incidence of dilation of the renal pelvis were observed at doses ≥ 8 mg/kg/day. The no observed effect dose for developmental toxicity in rats is 0.3 mg/kg/day, about one-tenth the MRHD of 40 mg/day.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><br/>
Amlodipine.</span></span> No evidence of teratogenicity or other embryo/fetal toxicity was found when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate at doses of up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (respectively about 10 and 20 times the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg amlodipine on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) during their respective periods of major organogenesis. (Calculations based on a patient weight of 60 kg). However, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold) in rats receiving amlodipine maleate at a dose equivalent to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day for 14 days before mating and throughout mating and gestation. Amlodipine maleate has been shown to prolong both the gestational period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether the amlodipine or olmesartan medoxomil components of Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets are excreted in human milk, but olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets:</span> If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years of age or older and younger subjects.<br/>
<br/>
Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine. Starting amlodipine or adding amlodipine at 2.5 mg in patients ≥ 75 years old is recommended. The lowest dose of Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets is 5/20 mg; therefore, initial therapy with Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets is not recommended in patients ≥ 75 years old.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><br/>
Amlodipine.</span></span> Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of AUC of approximately 40% to 60%, and a lower initial dose may be required.<br/>

<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><br/>
Amlodipine.</span></span> Single oral doses of amlodipine maleate equivalent to 40 mg amlodipine/kg and 100 mg amlodipine/kg in mice and rats, respectively, caused deaths. Single oral amlodipine maleate doses equivalent to 4 or more mg amlodipine/kg or higher in dogs (11 or more times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) caused a marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension.<br/>
<br/>
Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly a reflex tachycardia. In humans, experience with intentional overdosage of amlodipine is limited.<br/>
<br/>
If massive overdose should occur, active cardiac and respiratory monitoring should be instituted. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids should be initiated. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) should be considered with attention to circulating volume and urine output. Intravenous calcium gluconate may help to reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade. As amlodipine is highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><br/>
Olmesartan medoxomil.</span></span> Limited data are available related to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurs. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated.

The amlodipine component of amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil tablets inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle, and the olmesartan medoxomil component of amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil tablets blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Amlodipine.</span></span> Experimental data suggests that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nonhydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect.<br/>
<br/>
Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil.</span></span> Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor in vascular smooth muscle. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.<br/>
<br/>
An AT<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor than for the AT<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor.<br/>
<br/>
Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is a mechanism of many drugs used to treat hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known.<br/>
<br/>
Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Amlodipine.</span></span> Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.<br/>
<br/>
With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/-2 mmHg).<br/>
<br/>
In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.<br/>
<br/>
As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when co-administered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normals or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects.<br/>
<br/>
Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><br/>
Olmesartan medoxomil.</span></span> Olmesartan medoxomil doses of 2.5 mg to 40 mg inhibit the pressor effects of angiotensin I infusion. The duration of the inhibitory effect was related to dose, with doses of olmesartan medoxomil &gt; 40 mg giving &gt; 90% inhibition at 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II and plasma renin activity (PRA) increase after single and repeated administration of olmesartan medoxomil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. Repeated administration of up to 80 mg olmesartan medoxomil had minimal influence on aldosterone levels and no effect on serum potassium.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil from Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets are equivalent to the pharmacokinetics of Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil when administered separately. The bioavailability of both components is well below 100%, but neither component is affected by food. The effective half-lives of amlodipine (45 ± 11 hours) and olmesartan (7 ± 1 hours) result in a 2- to 3- fold accumulation for amlodipine and negligible accumulation for olmesartan with once-daily dosing.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Amlodipine.</span></span> After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine, absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours.

Approximately 35% to 50% of the absorbed dose is recovered in urine while the remainder is eliminated in feces via the bile.</p><p>Olmesartan appears to be eliminated in a biphasic manner with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Olmesartan shows linear pharmacokinetics following single oral doses of up to 320 mg and multiple oral doses of up to 80 mg.

Limited data exist in patients ≥ 75 years of age.</p><p>Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets were effective in treating black patients (usually a low-renin population), and the magnitude of blood pressure reduction in black patients approached that observed for non-Black patients. This effect in black patients has been seen with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta-blockers.</p><p>The blood pressure lowering effect was maintained throughout the 24-hour period with Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets once daily, with trough-to-peak ratios for systolic and diastolic response between 71% and 82%.</p><p>Upon completing the 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 1684 patients entered a 44-week open-label extension and received combination therapy with amlodipine 5 mg plus olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg. During the open-label extension, patients whose blood pressure was not adequately controlled (i.e., did not achieve a blood pressure goal of &lt; 140/90 mmHg, or &lt; 130/80 mmHg for those patients with diabetes) on amlodipine/olmesartan medoxomil 5/40 mg were titrated to amlodipine /olmesartan medoxomil 10/40 mg. Patients whose blood pressure was still not adequately controlled were offered additional hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and subsequently 25 mg as required to achieve adequate blood pressure goal.</p><p>There are no trials of Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil demonstrating reductions in cardiovascular risk in patients with hypertension, but at least one pharmacologically similar drug has demonstrated such benefits.</p><h3>Amlodipine</h3><p class="First">The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours post-dose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect.</p><h3>Olmesartan Medoxomil</h3><p class="First">The antihypertensive effects of olmesartan medoxomil have been demonstrated in seven placebo-controlled studies at doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 80 mg for 6 to 12 weeks, each showing statistically significant reductions in peak and trough blood pressure. A total of 2693 patients (2145 olmesartan medoxomil; 548 placebo) with essential hypertension were studied. The blood pressure lowering effect was maintained throughout the 24-hour period with olmesartan medoxomil once daily, with trough-to-peak ratios for systolic and diastolic response between 60% and 80%.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets contain amlodipine besylate at a dose equivalent to 5 or 10 mg Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil in the strengths described below.</p><p>Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil tablets are differentiated by tablet color/size and are debossed with an individual product tablet code on one side.
