</ul><h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2><p class="First">LexiCaps Patch<span class="Sup">®</span> is a prescription topical patch containing 15 articulated LexiCaps Patches (5 per re-sealable pouch x 3 pouches). Capsaicin is present in a 0.025% concentration (w/w). It is chemically designated as (<span class="Italics">E</span>)-<span class="Italics">N</span>-[(4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) methyl]-8-methylnon-6-enamide and has an empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">27</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span>. The molecular weight of capsaicin is 305.41 g/mol. Menthol is present in a 5% concentration (w/w). The chemical name is (1<span class="Italics">R</span>,2<span class="Italics">S</span>,5<span class="Italics">R</span>)-2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanol. The empirical formula for menthol is C<span class="Sub">10</span>H<span class="Sub">20</span>O with a molecular weight of 156.27 g/mol.</p><p>The structural formulas are:</p><p>** <span class="Bold Underline">Menthol</span> **</p><p></p><p>** <span class="Bold Underline">Capsaicin</span>**</p><p></p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Capsaicin</span> is an active component of chili peppers known clinically as a rubefacient. It acts as a counter-irritant by producing heat when in contact with human tissue. Mechanistically, capsaicin exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by mimicking a burning sensation – whereby overwhelming the nerves by calcium influx, thereby rendering the nerves unable to signal a pain response for an extended period of time. With repeated exposure, the neurons become depleted of neurotransmitters –specifically substance P - leading to a reduction in the sensation of pain and the blockade of neurogenic inflammation. This process is reversed when the capsaicin is discontinued.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Menthol</span> has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it also acts as a weak kappa (κ) opioid receptor agonist. Menthol acts to chemically trigger the cold-sensitive TRPM-8 receptors in the skin - responsible for the well-known cooling sensation it stimulates when applied directly to the skin. Menthol's analgesic properties are not fully understood, however they are mediated through a selective activation of κ-opioid receptors. Menthol also blocks voltage-sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscle tissue.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">LexiCaps Patch<span class="Sup">®</span> is a formulation used to assist patients for the temporary relief of minor aches &amp; pains of muscles &amp; joints associated with arthritis, simple backache, strains, bruises, and sprains. Peripheral neuropathies such as diabetic neuropathy or post herpetic neuralgia, may also be symptomatically improved using this patch if recommended by the healthcare team.</span></p><p>Other uses may be considered if deemed clinically relevant.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Known hypersensitivity to menthol, capsaicin, or any of the inactive ingredients listed above.</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Because of the possibility of sedation, patients should be cautioned regarding the operation of serious machinery or automobiles, and activities made hazardous by decreased alertness.</p><h2>DRUG INTERACTIONS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">No Drug interactions have been assessed with LexiCaps Patch <span class="Sup">®</span></span></p><h2>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nonclinical toxicity studies to determine the potential of this topical</span> preparation to cause carcinogenicity or mutagenicity have not been performed.
