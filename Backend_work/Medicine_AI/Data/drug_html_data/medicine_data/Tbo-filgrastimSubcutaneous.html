It is a synthetic (man-made) form of a substance that is naturally produced in the body called a colony stimulating factor. Tbo-filgrastim helps the bone marrow to make new white blood cells.</p><p>When certain cancer medicines are used to fight cancer cells, they also affect the white blood cells that fight infections. Tbo-filgrastim is used to prevent or reduce the risk of infection while you are being treated with cancer medicines.</p><p>Tbo-filgrastim is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using tbo-filgrastim</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
