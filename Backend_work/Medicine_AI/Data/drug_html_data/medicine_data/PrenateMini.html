Administration of omega-3 fatty acids should be avoided in patients taking anticoagulants and in those known to have an inherited or acquired predisposition to bleeding.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where Vitamin B12 is deficient. Folic acid in doses above 1.0 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations progress. This product contains FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING:</span> Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS:</span> Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</span> Before, during and/or after pregnancy, one softgel daily or as directed by a physician.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HOW SUPPLIED:</span> Bottles of 30 softgels (75854-0315-30).
