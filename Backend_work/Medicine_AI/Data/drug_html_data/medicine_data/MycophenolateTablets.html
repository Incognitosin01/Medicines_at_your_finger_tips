</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Mycophenolate Tablets</h2><p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection, in recipients of allogeneic kidney <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)],</span> heart <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span> or liver transplants <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>, in combination with other immunosuppressants.</p><h2>Mycophenolate Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mycophenolate mofetil should not be used without the supervision of a physician with experience in immunosuppressive therapy.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Mycophenolate Mofetil Capsules and Tablets</span> </p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil oral dosage forms (capsules or tablets) <span class="Bold">should not be used interchangeably with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets without supervision of a physician with experience in immunosuppressive therapy</span> because the rates of absorption following the administration of mycophenolate mofetil oral dosage forms and mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are not equivalent.</p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil tablets should not be crushed and mycophenolate mofetil capsules should not be opened or crushed. Patients should avoid inhalation or contact of the skin or mucous membranes with the powder contained in mycophenolate mofetil capsules. If such contact occurs, they must wash the area of contact thoroughly with soap and water. In case of ocular contact, rinse eyes with plain water.</p><p>The initial oral dose of mycophenolate mofetil should be given as soon as possible following kidney, heart or liver transplant. It is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil be administered on an empty stomach. In stable transplant patients, however, mycophenolate mofetil may be administered with food if necessary <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12</span>.3)].</p><p>Patients should be instructed to take a missed dose as soon as they remember, except if it is closer than 2 hours to the next scheduled dose; in this case, they should continue to take mycophenolate mofetil at the usual times.</p><h3>Dosing for Kidney Transplant Patients: Adults and Pediatrics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The recommended dose for adult kidney transplant patients is 1 g orally, twice daily (daily dose of 2 g).</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatrics (3 months and older)</span></p><p>Pediatric dosing is based on body surface area (BSA). The recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil for oral suspension for pediatric kidney transplant patients 3 months and older is 600 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, administered twice daily (maximum daily dose of 2g or 10 mL of the oral suspension). Pediatric patients with BSA ≥ 1.25 m<span class="Sup">2</span> may be dosed with capsules or tablets as follows:</p><p>.</p><p class="First">Body Surface Area<br/></p><p class="First">Dosing<br/></p><p class="First">1.25 m<span class="Sup">2</span> to &lt;1.5 m<span class="Sup">2</span><br/></p><p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil capsule 750 mg twice daily (1.5 g daily dose)<br/></p><p class="First">≥ 1.5 m<span class="Sup">2</span><br/></p><p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil capsules or tablets 1 g twice daily (2 g daily dose)<br/></p><h3>Dosing for Heart Transplant Patients: Adults</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil for adult heart transplant patients is 1.5 g orally administered twice daily (daily dose of 3 g).</p><h3>Dosing for Liver Transplant Patients: Adults</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil for adult liver transplant patients is 1.5 g administered orally twice daily (daily dose of 3 g).</p><h3>Dosing Adjustments: Patients with Renal Impairment, Neutropenia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>No dose adjustments are needed in kidney transplant patients with delayed graft function postoperatively <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. In <span class="Bold">kidney transplant patients with severe chronic impairment of the graft</span> (GFR &lt;25 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>), do not administer doses of mycophenolate mofetil greater than 1 g twice a day. These patients should be carefully monitored <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Neutropenia</span></p><p>If neutropenia develops (ANC &lt;1.3 x 10<span class="Sup">3</span>/μL), dosing with mycophenolate mofetil should be interrupted or reduced, appropriate diagnostic tests performed, and the patient managed appropriately <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil for tablets and capsules are available in the following dosage form and strength:</p><p class="First">Capsules<br/></p><p class="First">250 mg mycophenolate mofetil, white to off-white blend of mycophenolate mofetil filled in size "1" hard gelatin capsule with Ivory Cap and Ivory Body, printed "SAL" on cap and "726" on body in black.<br/></p><p class="First">Tablets<br/></p><p class="First">500 mg mycophenolate mofetil, pinkish brown colored, capsule shaped, film coated tablet with "SAL" engraved on one side and engraved "725" on other side.<br/></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Allergic reactions to mycophenolate mofetil have been observed; therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mycophenolic acid (MPA) or any component of the drug product.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Embryofetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Use of MMF during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney and nervous system. Females of reproductive potential must be made aware of these risks and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. Avoid use of MMF during pregnancy if safer treatment options are available <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].</span></p><h3>Lymphoma and Other Malignancies</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. For patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.</p><p>Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of kidney, heart and liver transplant patients <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> The majority of PTLD cases appear to be related to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides PTLD were observed in clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Serious Infections</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil are at increased risk of developing bacterial, fungal, protozoal and new or reactivated viral infections, including opportunistic infections. The risk increases with the total immunosuppressive load. These infections may lead to serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and death <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), (6.2)].</span></p><p>Serious viral infections reported include:</p><p>Consider reducing immunosuppression in patients who develop new infections or reactivate viral infections, weighing the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft.</p><p>PVAN, especially due to BK virus infection, is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span> Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN.</p><p>PML, which is sometimes fatal, commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies, and ataxia <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms.</p><p>The risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease is highest among transplant recipients seronegative for CMV at time of transplant who receive a graft from a CMV seropositive donor. Therapeutic approaches to limiting CMV disease exist and should be routinely provided. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for CMV disease.</p><p>Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Monitoring infected patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV or HCV infection is recommended.</p><h3>Blood Dyscrasias: Neutropenia and Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA)</h3><p class="First">Severe neutropenia [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;0.5 x 10<span class="Sup">3</span>/μL] developed in transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil should be monitored for neutropenia<span class="Italics">.</span> Neutropenia has been observed most frequently in the period from 31 to 180 days post-transplant in patients treated for prevention of kidney, heart and liver rejection. The development of neutropenia may be related to mycophenolate mofetil itself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or a combination of these causes. If neutropenia develops (ANC &lt;1.3 x 10<span class="Sup">3</span>/μL), dosing with mycophenolate mofetil should be interrupted or the dose reduced, appropriate diagnostic tests performed, and the patient managed appropriately <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].</span></p><p>Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, unexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow depression.</p><p>Consider monitoring with complete blood counts weekly for the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months, and monthly for the remainder of the first year.</p><p>Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. In some cases, PRCA was found to be reversible with dose reduction or cessation of mycophenolate mofetil therapy. In transplant patients, however, reduced immunosuppression may place the graft at risk.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Complications</h3><p class="First">Gastrointestinal bleeding requiring hospitalization, ulceration and perforations were observed in clinical trials. Physicians should be aware of these serious adverse effects particularly when administering mycophenolate mofetil to patients with a gastrointestinal disease.</p><h3>Patients with Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyl-Transferase Deficiency (HGPRT)</h3><p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor; therefore it should be avoided in patients with hereditary deficiencies of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndromes because it may cause an exacerbation of disease symptoms characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of uric acid leading to symptoms associated with gout such as acute arthritis, tophi, nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis and renal disease including renal failure.</p><h3>Immunizations</h3><p class="First">During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (e.g., intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines) and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective. Advise patients to discuss with the physician before seeking any immunizations.</p><h3>Blood Donation</h3><p class="First">Patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil because their blood or blood products might be administered to a female of reproductive potential or a pregnant woman.</p><h3>Semen Donation</h3><p class="First">Based on animal data, men should not donate semen during therapy and for 90 days following discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil <span class="Italics">[see Use In Specific Populations (8.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Effect of Concomitant Medications on Mycophenolic Acid Concentrations</h3><p class="First">A variety of drugs have potential to alter systemic MPA exposure when co-administered with mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, determination of MPA concentrations in plasma before and after making any changes to immunosuppressive therapy, or when adding or discontinuing concomitant medications, may be appropriate to ensure MPA concentrations remain stable.</p><h3>Potential Impairment of Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery</h3><p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil may impact the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should avoid driving or using machines if they experience somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor, or hypotension during treatment with mycophenolate mofetil <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:</p><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>An estimated total of 1557 patients received mycophenolate mofetil during pivotal clinical trials in the prevention of acute organ rejection. Of these, 991 were included in the three renal studies, 277 were included in one hepatic study, and 289 were included in one cardiac study. Patients in all study arms also received cyclosporine and corticosteroids.</p><p>The data described below primarily derive from five randomized, active-controlled double- blind 12-month trials of mycophenolate mofetil in <span class="Italics">de novo</span> kidney (3) heart (1) and liver (1) transplant patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2 and 14.3)]</span>.</p><p> <span class="Bold">Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral</span></p><p>The incidence of adverse reactions for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in five randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in the prevention of rejection in kidney, heart and liver transplant patients (two active- and one placebo-controlled trials, one active-controlled trial, and one active-controlled trial, respectively) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2 and 14.3)]</span>.</p><p>The three <span class="Italics">de novo</span> kidney studies with 12-month duration compared two dose levels of oral mycophenolate mofetil (1 g twice daily and 1.5 g twice daily) with azathioprine (2 studies) or placebo (1 study) when administered in combination with cyclosporine (Sandimmune<span class="Sup">®</span>) and corticosteroids to prevent acute rejection episodes. One study also included anti-thymocyte globulin (ATGAM<span class="Sup">®</span>) induction therapy.</p><p>In the <span class="Italics">de novo</span> heart transplantation study with 12-month duration, patients received mycophenolate mofetil 1.5 g twice daily (n=289) or azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day (n=289), in combination with cyclosporine (Sandimmune<span class="Sup">®</span> or Neoral<span class="Sup">®</span>) and corticosteroids as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p>In the <span class="Italics">de novo</span> liver transplantation study with 12-month duration, patients received mycophenolate mofetil 1 g twice daily intravenously for up to 14 days followed by mycophenolate mofetil 1.5 g twice daily orally or azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day intravenously followed by azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day orally, in combination with cyclosporine (Neoral<span class="Sup">®</span>) and corticosteroids as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. The total number of patients enrolled was 565.</p><p>Approximately 53% of the kidney transplant patients, 65% of the heart transplant patients, and 48% of the liver transplant patients were treated for more than 1 year. Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

MPA is a selective, uncompetitive, and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and therefore inhibits the <span class="Italics">de novo</span> pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA. Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on de novo synthesis of purines, whereas other cell types can utilize salvage pathways, MPA has potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes. MPA inhibits proliferative responses of T- and B- lymphocytes to both mitogenic and allospecific stimulation. Addition of guanosine or deoxyguanosine reverses the cytostatic effects of MPA on lymphocytes. MPA also suppresses antibody formation by B-lymphocytes. MPA prevents the glycosylation of lymphocyte and monocyte glycoproteins that are involved in intercellular adhesion to endothelial cells and may inhibit recruitment of leukocytes into sites of inflammation and graft rejection. MMF did not inhibit early events in the activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, such as the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), but did block the coupling of these events to DNA synthesis and proliferation.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">There is a lack of information regarding the pharmacodynamic effects of MMF.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following oral and intravenous administration, MMF undergoes complete conversion to MPA, the active metabolite. In 12 healthy volunteers, the mean absolute bioavailability of oral MMF relative to intravenous MMF was 94%. Two 500 mg mycophenolate mofetil tablets have been shown to be bioequivalent to four 250 mg mycophenolate mofetil capsules. Five mL of the 200 mg/mL constituted mycophenolate mofetil oral suspension have been shown to be bioequivalent to four 250 mg capsules.</p><p>The mean (±SD) pharmacokinetic parameters estimates for MPA following the administration of MMF given as single doses to healthy volunteers, and multiple doses to kidney, heart, and liver transplant patients, are shown in <span class="Bold">Table 8</span>. The area under the plasma- concentration time curve (AUC) for MPA appears to increase in a dose-proportional fashion in kidney transplant patients receiving multiple oral doses of MMF up to a daily dose of 3 g (1.5g twice daily) (see <span class="Bold">Table 8</span>).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> Healthy Volunteers</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> Dose/Route</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> T max (h)</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> C max (mcg/mL)</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> Total AUC (mcg•h/mL)</span><br/></p><p class="First">Single dose<br/></p><p class="First">1 g/oral<br/></p><p class="First">0.80<br/>

At clinically relevant concentrations, MPA is 97% bound to plasma albumin. The phenolic glucuronide metabolite of MPA (MPAG) is 82% bound to plasma albumin at MPAG concentration ranges that are normally seen in stable kidney transplant patients; however, at higher MPAG concentrations (observed in patients with kidney impairment or delayed kidney graft function), the binding of MPA may be reduced as a result of competition between MPAG and MPA for protein binding. Mean blood to plasma ratio of radioactivity concentrations was approximately 0.6 indicating that MPA and MPAG do not extensively distribute into the cellular fractions of blood.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies to evaluate the effect of other agents on the binding of MPA to human serum albumin (HSA) or plasma proteins showed that salicylate (at 25 mg/dL with human serum albumin) and MPAG (at ≥ 460 mcg/mL with plasma proteins) increased the free fraction of MPA. MPA at concentrations as high as 100 mcg/mL had little effect on the binding of warfarin, digoxin or propranolol, but decreased the binding of theophylline from 53% to 45% and phenytoin from 90% to 87%.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Mean (±SD) apparent half-life and plasma clearance of MPA are 17.9 (±6.5) hours and 193 (±48) mL/min following oral administration.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>The parent drug, MMF, can be measured systemically during the intravenous infusion; however, approximately 5 minutes after the infusion is stopped or after oral administration, MMF concentrations are below the limit of quantitation (0.4 mcg/mL).</p><p>Metabolism to MPA occurs pre-systemically after oral dosing. MPA is metabolized principally by glucuronyl transferase to form MPAG, which is not pharmacologically active. <span class="Italics">In vivo</span>, MPAG is converted to MPA during enterohepatic recirculation. The following metabolites of the 2-hydroxyethyl-morpholino moiety are also recovered in the urine following oral administration of MMF to healthy subjects: N-(2-carboxymethyl)-morpholine, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine, and the N-oxide of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine.</p><p>Due to the enterohepatic recirculation of MPAG/MPA, secondary peaks in the plasma MPA concentration-time profile are usually observed 6 to 12 hours post-dose. Bile sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, reduce MPA AUC by interfering with this enterohepatic recirculation of the drug <span class="Italics">[see Overdose (10</span>) <span class="Italics">and Drug Interaction Studies below</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Negligible amount of drug is excreted as MPA (less than 1% of dose) in the urine.

Most (about 87%) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. At clinically encountered concentrations, MPA and MPAG are usually not removed by hemodialysis. However, at high MPAG plasma concentrations (&gt; 100 mcg/mL), small amounts of MPAG are removed.</p><p>Increased plasma concentrations of MMF metabolites (MPA 50% increase and MPAG about a 3-fold to 6-fold increase) are observed in patients with renal insufficiency <span class="Italics">[see Specific Populations].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The mean (±SD) pharmacokinetic parameters for MPA following the administration of oral MMF given as single doses to non-transplant subjects with renal impairment are presented in <span class="Bold">Table 9</span>.</p><p>In a single-dose study, MMF was administered as a capsule or as an intravenous infusion over 40 minutes.

These differences are not of clinical significance.</p><p><span class="Italics">Geriatric Patients</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil and its metabolites have not been found to be altered in elderly transplant patients when compared to younger transplant patients.</p><p><span class="Bold"> Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Acyclovir</span></p><p>Coadministration of MMF (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Italics">Antacids with Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides</span></p><p>Absorption of a single dose of MMF (2 g) was decreased when administered to 10 rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox<span class="Sup">®</span> TC (10 mL qid). The C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC(0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when MMF was administered alone under fasting conditions.</p><p><span class="Italics">Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)</span></p><p>Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to reduce the exposure to MPA. An approximate reduction of 30 to 70% in the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cholestyramine</span></p><p>Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g MMF to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g three times a day of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cyclosporine</span></p><p>Cyclosporine (Sandimmune<span class="Sup">®</span>) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g twice daily of MMF in 10 stable kidney transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC(0-12h) and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of MMF were 3290 (±822) ng•h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng•h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of MMF.</p><p>Cyclosporine A interferes with MPA enterohepatic recirculation. In kidney transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC(0-12h)) was approximately 30-50% greater when MMF was administered without cyclosporine compared with when MMF was coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Drugs Affecting Glucuronidation</span></p><p>Concomitant administration of drugs inhibiting glucuronidation of MPA may increase MPA exposure (e.g., increase of MPA AUC(0-∞) by 35% was observed with concomitant administration of isavuconazole).</p><p>Concomitant administration of telmisartan and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in an approximately 30% decrease in MPA concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA's elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced UGT1A9 expression and glucuronidation activity.</p><p><span class="Italics">Ganciclovir</span></p><p>Following single-dose administration to 12 stable kidney transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between MMF (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and C<span class="Sub">max </span> (n=10) were 54.3 (±19.0) mcg•h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) mcg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51.0 (±17.0) mcg•h/mL and 10.6 (±2.0) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) mcg•h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) μg•h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of MMF alone.</p><p><span class="Italics">Oral Contraceptives</span></p><p>A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g twice daily) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mean AUC(0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol.</p><p><span class="Italics">Sevelamer</span></p><p>Concomitant administration of sevelamer and MMF in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC (0-12h) by 36% and 26% respectively.</p><p><span class="Italics">Antimicrobials</span></p><p>Antimicrobials eliminating beta-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestine (e.g. aminoglycoside, cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and penicillin classes of antimicrobials) may interfere with the MPAG/MPA enterohepatic recirculation thus leading to reduced systemic MPA exposure.

The highest dose tested was 0.4 times the recommended clinical dose (2 g/day) in renal transplant patients and 0.3 times the recommended clinical dose (3 g/day) in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for differences in body surface area (BSA). In a 104-week oral carcinogenicity study in rats, MMF in daily doses up to 15 mg/kg was not tumorigenic. The highest dose was 0.07 times the recommended clinical dose in kidney transplant patients and 0.05 times the recommended clinical dose in heart transplant patients when corrected for BSA. While these animal doses were lower than those given to patients, they were maximal in those species and were considered adequate to evaluate the potential for human risk <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span> </p><p>The genotoxic potential of MMF was determined in five assays. MMF was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma/thymidine kinase assay and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay. MMF was not genotoxic in the bacterial mutation assay, the yeast mitotic gene conversion assay or the Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay.</p><p>MMF had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. This dose represents 0.1 times the recommended clinical dose in renal transplant patients and 0.06 times the recommended clinical dose in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for BSA. In a female fertility and reproduction study conducted in rats, oral doses of 4.5 mg/kg/day caused malformations (principally of the head and eyes) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. This dose was 0.02 times the recommended clinical dose in renal transplant patients and 0.01 times the recommended clinical dose in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for BSA. No effects on fertility or reproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Kidney Transplantation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The three <span class="Italics">de novo</span> kidney transplantation studies compared two dose levels of oral mycophenolate mofetil (1 g twice daily and 1.5 g twice daily) with azathioprine (2 studies) or placebo (1 study) to prevent acute rejection episodes.

There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or treatment.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> What is the most important information I should know about mycophenolate mofetil?</span><br/>
<span class="Bold"> Mycophenolate mofetil can cause serious side effects, including:</span><br/>
<span class="Bold"> Increased risk of loss of a pregnancy (miscarriage) and higher risk of birth defects.</span>  Females who take mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy have a higher risk of miscarriage during the first 3 months (first trimester), and a higher risk that their baby will be born with birth defects<br/>
 •  <span class="Bold"> If you are a female who can become pregnant</span> , your doctor must talk with you about acceptable birth control methods (contraceptive counseling) to use while taking mycophenolate mofetil. You should have 1 pregnancy test immediately before starting mycophenolate mofetil and another pregnancy test 8 to 10 days later. Pregnancy tests should be repeated during routine follow-up visits with your doctor. Talk to your doctor about the results of all of your pregnancy tests.<br/>
You must use acceptable birth control during your entire mycophenolate mofetil treatment and for 6 weeks after stopping mycophenolate mofetil, unless at any time you choose to avoid sexual intercourse (abstinence) with a man completely. Mycophenolate mofetil decreases blood levels of the hormones in birth control pills that you take by mouth. Birth control pills may not work as well while you take mycophenolate mofetil, and you could become pregnant. If you take birth control pills while using mycophenolate mofetil you must also use another form of birth control. Talk to your doctor about other birth control methods that you can use while taking mycophenolate mofetil. <br/>
 •  <span class="Bold"> If you are a sexually active male whose female partner can become pregnant while you are taking mycophenolate mofetil,</span>   use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 90 days after stopping mycophenolate mofetil.<br/>
 •  <span class="Bold"> If you plan to become pregnant</span> , talk with your doctor. Your doctor will decide if other medicines to prevent rejection may be right for you.<br/>
 •  <span class="Bold"> If you become pregnant while taking mycophenolate mofetil, do not stop taking mycophenolate mofetil. Call your doctor right away.</span>  You and your doctor may decide that other medicines to prevent rejection may be right for you. You and your doctor should report your pregnancy to the Mycophenolate Pregnancy Registry either:<br/>
 o    By phone at 1-800-617-8191 <span class="Bold"> or</span><br/>
 o    By visiting the REMS website at: <span class="Bold"> www.mycophenolateREMS.com</span><br/>
The purpose of this registry is to gather information about the health of you and your baby.<br/>
<span class="Bold"> Increased risk of getting certain cancers.</span>  People who take mycophenolate mofetil have a higher risk of getting lymphoma, and other cancers, especially skin cancer. Tell your doctor if you have:<br/>
 •  unexplained fever, prolonged tiredness, weight loss or lymph node swelling<br/>
 •  a brown or black skin lesion with uneven borders, or one part of the lesion does not look like the other<br/>
 •  a change in the size and color of a mole<br/>
 •  a new skin lesion or bump<br/>
 •  any other changes to your health<br/>
<span class="Bold"> Increased risk of getting serious infections.</span>  Mycophenolate mofetil weakens the body's immune system and affects your ability to fight infections. Serious infections can happen with mycophenolate mofetil and can lead to hospitalizations and death. These serious infections can include:<br/>
 •  <span class="Bold"> Viral infections.</span>  Certain viruses can live in your body and cause active infections when your immune system is weak. Viral infections that can happen with mycophenolate mofetil include:<br/>
