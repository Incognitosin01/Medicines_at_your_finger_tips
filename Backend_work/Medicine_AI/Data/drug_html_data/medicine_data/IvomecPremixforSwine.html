<li>Dosage and Administration</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Type A Medicated Article</span></p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">For the treatment and control of gastrointestinal roundworms (<span class="Italics">Ascaris suum,</span> adults and fourth-stage larvae; <span class="Italics">Ascarops strongylina,</span> adults; <span class="Italics">Hyostrongylus rubidus,</span> adults and fourth-stage larvae; <span class="Italics">Oesophagostomum</span> spp., adults and fourth-stage larvae), kidneyworms (<span class="Italics">Stephanurus dentatus</span>, adults and fourth-stage larvae), lungworms (<span class="Italics">Metastrongylus</span> spp., adults), threadworms (<span class="Italics">Strongyloides ransomi,</span> adults and somatic larvae, and prevention of transmission of infective larvae to piglets, via colostrum or milk, when fed during gestation), lice (<span class="Italics">Haematopinus suis</span>) and mange mites (<span class="Italics">Sarcoptes scabiei</span> var. <span class="Italics">suis</span>) when incorporated into complete swine feeds at the level listed in the tables below. Follow mixing directions when preparing complete feeds.</p><h2>Ivomec Premix for Swine Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>MIXING AND FEEDING DIRECTIONS FOR WEANED/GROWING/FINISHING PIGS</h3><p class="First">Add IVOMEC Premix (Type A Medicated Article) to starter, grower and finisher feeds at 300 g per ton to supply 1.8 g ivermectin per ton (2 ppm) of feed.</p><p>Use this Type C Medicated Feed as the only feed <span class="Italics">ad libitum</span> for 7 consecutive days. This provides approximately 0.1 mg ivermectin per kg (2.2 lb) of body weight per day.</p><h3>MIXING AND FEEDING DIRECTIONS FOR ADULT AND BREEDING ANIMALS</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose level for breeding animals is 0.1 mg ivermectin/kg body weight daily for seven consecutive days. Add IVOMEC Premix (Type A Medicated Article) to complete feed at 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) per ton to supply 9.1 g ivermectin per ton (10 ppm) of feed. Feed this Type C Medicated Feed at the rate of 1 lb (454 g) per 100 lb of body weight daily for seven consecutive days. On a daily basis, any additional non-medicated feed should not be given until the medicated feed is consumed. For heavy animals being fed less than 1% of their body weight per day, the ivermectin level in the Type C Medicated Feed can be up to 11.8 g per ton.</p><p>As sow feeding practices vary during the different phases of their reproductive cycle (i.e., limited feeding during gestation and <span class="Italics">ad libitum</span> during lactation), the inclusion rate of ivermectin per ton of complete feed can be adjusted accordingly to obtain the 0.1 mg/kg treatment level.</p><p>As an example, the following inclusion rates for IVOMEC Premix w/w (Type A Medicated Article) based on body weight and feed intake are determined by the formula.</p><p><span class="Bold Underline">IVOMEC Premix (Type A Medicated Article) should be thoroughly and evenly mixed in the feed in accordance with good manufacturing practices for medicated feeds.</span></p><p>Dispersion of IVOMEC Premix in the feed is enhanced by diluting 1 part of this 0.6% Type A Medicated Article with 14 parts of finely ground feed ingredients to provide an intermediate premix.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WITHDRAW</span> 5 days before slaughter. NOT FOR HUMAN USE</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children.</span></p><h2>CAUTION</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>This product contains IVOMEC brand ivermectin and has been formulated specifically for use in swine only. This product should not be used for other animal species.</li>
<li>Consult your veterinarian for assistance in the diagnosis, treatment and control of parasitism.</li>
</ul><p class="First">Restricted Drug - Use only as directed (California).</p><h2>ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY</h2><p class="First">Studies show that when ivermectin comes in contact with the soil, it readily and tightly binds to the soil and becomes inactive over time. Free ivermectin may adversely affect fish and certain water-borne organisms on which they feed. Do not permit water runoff from swine production sites to directly enter lakes, streams or ponds. Do not contaminate water by direct application or by the improper disposal of drug containers. Dispose of containers in an approved landfill or by incineration.</p><h2>RECOMMENDED TREATMENT PROGRAM</h2><h3>Weaned/Growing/Finishing Pigs</h3><p class="First">All weaners/feeder pigs should be treated upon placement in clean quarters. Frequency of and need for additional treatments are dependent upon parasite exposure.</p><h3>Adult and Breeding Animals</h3><p class="First">At the time of initiating any parasite control program, it is important to treat all animals in the herd. After the initial treatment, use IVOMEC Premix regularly as follows:</p><p><span class="Bold">NOTE</span>: (1) Since the effect of ivermectin on mange mites is not immediate, avoid contact between treated pigs and mange-free pigs for approximately one week after completion of treatment. Exposure of treated pigs to mange-infected pigs may result in reinfestation.<br/>
(2) Louse eggs are unaffected by ivermectin and may require up to three weeks to hatch. Louse infestations developing from hatching eggs may require retreatment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">IVOMEC</span> and Pig Head logo are registered trademarks of Merial Limited.<br/>
