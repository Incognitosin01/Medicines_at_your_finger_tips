It is also used to help prevent melanoma from coming back after it and lymph nodes affected by cancer have been removed by surgery.</p><p>Pembrolizumab injection is used alone to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread, whose tumors express PD-L1 and do not have an abnormal EGFR or ALK gene in patients who have not received other cancer treatments. It is also used alone to treat NSCLC that has spread, whose tumors express PD-L1 and have an abnormal EGFR or ALK gene in patients who have received other cancer medicines (eg, platinum) that did not work well. Pembrolizumab injection is also used alone as first-line treatment for stage III NSCLC in patients who cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation or for NSCLC that has spread and whose tumors express PD-L1 without an abnormal EGFR or ALK gene. Pembrolizumab is also used in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-containing chemotherapy to treat NSCLC that has spread and whose tumors do not have an abnormal EGFR or ALK gene. Pembrolizumab injection is also used together with carboplatin and paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel to treat squamous NSCLC that has spread.</p><p>Pembrolizumab injection is also used to treat metastatic (cancer that has spread) small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has progressed in patients who had received platinum-containing chemotherapy or at least one other line of treatment that did not work well.</p><p>Pembrolizumab injection is used in combination with platinum and fluorouracil as first-line treatment of head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery. Pembrolizumab is also given to patients whose tumors express PD-L1 or patients who have received other cancer medicines (eg, platinum) that did not work well.</p><p>Pembrolizumab injection is used to treat relapsed (cancer that has come back) or refractory (cancer that did not respond to treatment) classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in adults. Pembrolizumab is also used to treat cHL in children who have tried a treatment that did not work, or whose cHL has returned after 2 or more previous lines of treatment.</p><p>Pembrolizumab injection is used to treat primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) in patients who have tried a treatment that did not work, or whose PMBCL has returned after 2 or more previous lines of treatment.</p><p>Pembrolizumab injection is also used to treat urothelial carcinoma (a type of urinary tract cancer) that has spread throughout the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (advanced). Pembrolizumab is given to patients who are not able to receive cisplatin and whose tumors express PD-L1, patients who are not able to receive carboplatin or cisplatin, or patients who have received other cancer medicines (eg, platinum) that did not work well. Pembrolizumab is also used to treat patients with high-risk Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-unresponsive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with a tumor type called carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors who cannot receive or have not decided to have surgery to remove the bladder.</p><p>Pembrolizumab injection is also used to treat microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumor or colorectal cancer (cancer of the colon or rectum) that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery. It is given to patients who have received other cancer treatments (eg, fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan) that did not work well. Pembrolizumab is also used as first-line treatment of MSI-H or dMMR colorectal cancer (CRC) that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery.</p><p>Pembrolizumab injection is also used to treat a type of stomach cancer called gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that has returned or spread, and whose tumors express PD-L1. It is given to patients who have received 2 or more types of cancer treatment (eg, fluoropyrimidine, platinum) that did not work well, or in patients with tumor that has an abnormal HER2/neu gene and have received a HER2/neu-targeted medicine that did not work well.</p><p>Pembrolizumab injection is also used to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus that has returned or spread, and whose tumors express PD-L1. It is given to patients who have received 1 or more types of treatment that did not work well.</p><p>Pembrolizumab injection is used to treat cervical cancer that has returned or spread, and whose tumors express PD-L1.</p><p>Pembrolizumab injection is also used to treat a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients who have been previously treated with sorafenib that did not work well.</p><p>Pembrolizumab injection is also used to treat a kind of skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) that has returned or spread, or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) that has returned or spread and cannot be cured by surgery or radiation.</p><p>Pembrolizumab injection is also used in combination with axitinib as first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a kind of kidney cancer, in patients whose cancer has spread or cannot be removed by surgery.</p><p>Pembrolizumab injection is also used in combination with lenvatinib to treat advanced endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus or womb) that is not MSI-H or dMMR, in patients who have received other cancer medicines but did not work well and cannot be removed by surgery or radiation.</p><p>Pembrolizumab injection is also used to treat a type of cancer called tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) in patients whose solid tumors have spread or cannot be removed by surgery. It is given to patients who have received other cancer treatments that did not work well and who have no other treatment options.</p><p>Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that changes the immune system to help control the growth of cancer cells.</p><p>Pembrolizumab is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using pembrolizumab</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For pembrolizumab, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to pembrolizumab or any other medicines.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pembrolizumab injection in children with lymphoma, solid tumors, colorectal cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, microsatellite instability-high cancer, or tumor mutational burden-high cancer. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children with other cancers.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pembrolizumab injection in the elderly. Safety and efficacy have been established.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.
