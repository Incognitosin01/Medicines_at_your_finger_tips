<span class="Bold">Reconstitute Before Dispensing</span></p><h2>Benzamycin Gel Description</h2><p class="First">Benzamycin<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Gel contains erythromycin [(3R*,4S*,5S*,6R*, 7R*, 9R*, 11R*, 12R*, 13S*, 14R*)-4-[(2,6-Dideoxy-3-<span class="Italics">C</span>-methyl-3-<span class="Italics">O</span>-methyl-α-L-<span class="Italics">ribo</span>-hexopyranosyl)-oxy]-14-ethyl-7,12,13-trihydroxy-3,5,7,9,11,13-hexamethyl-6-[[3,4,6-trideoxy-3-(dimethylamino)-β-D-<span class="Italics">xylo</span>-hexopyranosyl]oxy]oxacyclotetradecane-2,10-dione]. Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic produced from a strain of <span class="Italics">Saccharopolyspora erythraea</span> (formerly <span class="Italics">Streptomyces erythreus</span>). It is a base and readily forms salts with acids.</p><p>Chemically erythromycin is C<span class="Sub">37</span>H<span class="Sub">67</span>NO<span class="Sub">13</span>. It has the following structural formula:</p><p>Erythromycin has the molecular weight of 733.94. It is a white crystalline powder and has a solubility of approximately 1 mg/mL in water and is soluble in alcohol at 25°C.</p><p>Benzamycin Topical Gel also contains benzoyl peroxide for topical use. Benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial and keratolytic agent.</p><p>Chemically benzoyl peroxide is C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">10</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>. It has the following structural formula:</p><p>Benzoyl peroxide has the molecular weight of 242.23. It is a white granular powder and is sparingly soluble in water and alcohol and soluble in acetone, chloroform and ether.</p><p>Each gram of Benzamycin Topical Gel contains, as dispensed, 30 mg (3%) of erythromycin and 50 mg (5%) of benzoyl peroxide in a base of purified water USP, Carbomer Homopolymer Type C, alcohol 20%, sodium hydroxide NF, docusate sodium and fragrance.</p><h2>Benzamycin Gel - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The exact mechanism by which erythromycin reduces lesions of acne vulgaris is not fully known; however, the effect appears to be due in part to the antibacterial activity of the drug.</p><p>Benzoyl peroxide has a keratolytic and desquamative effect which may also contribute to its efficacy. Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid.</p><h2>MICROBIOLOGY</h2><p class="First">Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by reversibly binding to 50 <span class="Bold">S</span> ribosomal subunits, thereby inhibiting translocation of aminoacyl transfer-RNA and inhibiting polypeptide synthesis. Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between erythromycin, lincomycin, chloramphenicol and clindamycin.</p><p>Benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial agent which has been shown to be effective against <span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes</span>, an anaerobe found in sebaceous follicles and comedones. The antibacterial action of benzoyl peroxide is believed to be due to the release of active oxygen.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Benzamycin Gel</h2><p class="First">Benzamycin Topical Gel is indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Benzamycin Topical Gel is contraindicated in those individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its components.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including erythromycin, and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents.</span></p><p>Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> is one primary cause of “antibiotic-associated colitis”.</p><p>After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically effective against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> colitis.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General:</h3><p class="First">For topical use only; not for ophthalmic use. Concomitant topical acne therapy should be used with caution because a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating or abrasive agents. If severe irritation develops, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.</p><p>The use of antibiotic agents may be associated with the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi. If this occurs, discontinue use and take appropriate measures.</p><p>Avoid contact with eyes and all mucous membranes.</p><h3>Information for Patients:</h3><p class="First">Patients using Benzamycin Topical Gel should receive the following information and instructions:</p><h3>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY</h3><p class="First">Data from a study using mice known to be highly susceptible to cancer suggests that benzoyl peroxide acts as a tumor promoter. The clinical significance of this is unknown.</p><p>No animal studies have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential or effects on fertility of topical erythromycin. However, long-term (2-year) oral studies in rats with erythromycin ethylsuccinate and erythromycin base did not provide evidence of tumorigenicity. There was no apparent effect on male or female fertility in rats fed erythromycin (base) at levels up to 0.25% of diet.</p><h3>Pregnancy:</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Benzamycin Topical Gel or benzoyl peroxide.</p><p>There was no evidence of teratogenicity or any other adverse effect on reproduction in female rats fed erythromycin base (up to 0.25% diet) prior to and during mating, during gestation and through weaning of two successive litters.</p><p>There are no well-controlled trials in pregnant women with Benzamycin Topical Gel. It also is not known whether Benzamycin Topical Gel can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Benzamycin Topical Gel should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Women:</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether Benzamycin Topical Gel is excreted in human milk after topical application. However, erythromycin is excreted in human milk following oral and parenteral erythromycin administration. Therefore, caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use:</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of this product in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of adverse reactions associated with the use of Benzamycin Topical Gel was approximately 3%. These were dryness and urticarial reaction.</p><p>The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported occasionally: irritation of the skin including peeling, itching, burning sensation, erythema, inflammation of the face, eyes and nose, and irritation of the eyes. Skin discoloration, oiliness and tenderness of the skin have also been reported.</p><p><span class="Bold">To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bausch Health US, LLC at 1-800-321-4576 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</span></p><h2>Benzamycin Gel Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Benzamycin Topical Gel should be applied twice daily, morning and evening, or as directed by a physician, to affected areas after the skin is thoroughly washed, rinsed with warm water and gently patted dry.</p><h2>How Supplied and Compounding Directions:</h2><p class="First">Size</p><p class="First">Benzoyl</p><p>Peroxide Gel</p><p class="First">Active Erythromycin</p><p>Powder</p><p>(In Plastic Vial)</p><p class="First">70% Ethyl Alcohol</p><p>To Be</p><p>Added</p><p class="First">(Net Weight)</p><p class="First">NDC</p><p class="First">46.6 grams</p><p class="First">0187-5205-46</p><p class="First">40 grams</p><p class="First">1.6 grams</p><p class="First">6 mL</p><p class="First">(as dispensed)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Prior to dispensing, tap vial until all powder flows freely.
