</ul><h2>Clonazepam Tablet Orally Disintegrating Description</h2><p class="First">Clonazepam, USP a benzodiazepine, is available as an orally disintegrating tablet containing 0.125 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg or 2 mg clonazepam, USP. Each orally disintegrating tablet also contains sorbitol, aspartame, sodium lauryl sulfate, crospovidone, mannitol, colloidal silicon dioxide, talc and magnesium stearate.</p><p>Chemically, clonazepam, USP is 5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-7-nitro-2<span class="Italics">H</span>-1,4-­benzodiazepin-2-one. It is a light yellow powder. It has a molecular weight of 315.72 and the following structural formula:<br/>
</p><h2>Clonazepam Tablet Orally Disintegrating - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pharmacodynamics:</span></span> The precise mechanism by which clonazepam exerts its antiseizure and antipanic effects is unknown, although it is believed to be related to its ability to enhance the activity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Convulsions produced in rodents by pentylenetetrazol or, to a lesser extent, electrical stimulation are antagonized, as are convulsions produced by photic stimulation in susceptible baboons. A taming effect in aggressive primates, muscle weakness and hypnosis are also produced. In humans, clonazepam is capable of suppressing the spike and wave discharge in absence seizures (petit mal) and decreasing the frequency, amplitude, duration and spread of discharge in minor motor seizures.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics:</span></span> Clonazepam is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of clonazepam is about 90%. Maximum plasma concentrations of clonazepam are reached within 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. Clonazepam is approximately 85% bound to plasma proteins. Clonazepam is highly metabolized, with less than 2% unchanged clonazepam being excreted in the urine. Biotransformation occurs mainly by reduction of the 7-nitro group to the 4-amino derivative. This derivative can be acetylated, hydroxylated and glucuronidated. Cytochrome P-450 including CYP3A, may play an important role in clonazepam reduction and oxidation. The elimination half-life of clonazepam is typically 30 to 40 hours. Clonazepam pharmacokinetics are dose-independent throughout the dosing range. There is no evidence that clonazepam induces its own metabolism or that of other drugs in humans.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics in Demographic Subpopulations and in Disease States:</span></span><span class="Italics"> </span>Controlled studies examining the influence of gender and age on clonazepam pharmacokinetics have not been conducted, nor have the effects of renal or liver disease on clonazepam pharmacokinetics been studied. Because clonazepam undergoes hepatic metabolism, it is possible that liver disease will impair clonazepam elimination. Thus, caution should be exercised when administering clonazepam to these patients.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Clinical Trials:</span></span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Panic Disorder</span></span><span class="Italics">:</span> The effectiveness of clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets in the treatment of panic disorder was demonstrated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients who had a primary diagnosis of panic disorder (DSM-IIIR) with or without agoraphobia. In these studies, clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo in treating panic disorder on change from baseline in panic attack frequency, the Clinician’s Global Impression Severity of Illness Score and the Clinician’s Global Impression Improvement Score.</p><p>Study 1 was a 9-week, fixed-dose study involving clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/day or placebo. This study was conducted in four phases: a 1-week placebo lead-in, a 3-week upward titration, a 6-week fixed dose and a 7-week discontinuance phase. A significant difference from placebo was observed consistently only for the 1 mg/day group. The difference between the 1 mg dose group and placebo in reduction from baseline in the number of full panic attacks was approximately 1 panic attack per week. At endpoint, 74% of patients receiving clonazepam 1 mg/day were free of full panic attacks, compared to 56% of placebo-treated patients.</p><p>Study 2 was a 6-week, flexible-dose study involving clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets in a dose range of 0.5 to 4 mg/day or placebo. This study was conducted in three phases: a 1-week placebo lead-in, a 6-week optimal-dose and a 6-week discontinuance phase. The mean clonazepam dose during the optimal dosing period was 2.3 mg/day. The difference between clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets and placebo in reduction from baseline in the number of full panic attacks was approximately 1 panic attack per week. At endpoint, 62% of patients receiving clonazepam were free of full panic attacks, compared to 37% of placebo-treated patients.</p><p>Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of race or gender.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Seizure Disorders:</span></span> Clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet is useful alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. In patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides, clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets may be useful.</p><p>In some studies, up to 30% of patients have shown a loss of anticonvulsant activity, often within 3 months of administration. In some cases, dosage adjustment may reestablish efficacy.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Panic Disorder:</span></span> Clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-V. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks.</p><p>The efficacy of clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets was established in two 6- to 9-week trials in panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-IIIR category of panic disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: <span class="Italics">Clinical Trials</span>).</p><p>Panic disorder (DSM-V) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, ie, a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes.</p><p>The effectiveness of clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets are contraindicated in patients with the following conditions:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>History of sensitivity to benzodiazepines</li>
<li>Clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease</li>
<li>Acute narrow angle glaucoma (it may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy).</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risks from Concomitant Use With Opioids:</span></span> Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet is used with opioids (see PRECAUTIONS: <span class="Italics">Information for Patients</span> and PRECAUTIONS: <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Interference With Cognitive and Motor Performance:</span></span> Since clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets produces CNS depression, patients receiving this drug should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. They should also be warned about the concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS-depressant drugs during clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span> and <span class="Italics">Information for Patients</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Suicidal Behavior and Ideation:</span></span> Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p><p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono-and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43% compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p><p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p><p>Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.</p><p>Anyone considering prescribing clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p><p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Risks:</span></span> Data from several sources raise concerns about the use of clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets during pregnancy.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Animal Findings:</span></span><span class="Italics"> </span>In three studies in which clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses of 0.2, 1, 5 or 10 mg/kg/day (low dose approximately 0.2 times the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and equivalent to the maximum dose of 4 mg/day for panic disorder, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis) during the period of organogenesis, a similar pattern of malformations (cleft palate, open eyelid, fused sternebrae and limb defects) was observed in a low, non-dose-related incidence in exposed litters from all dosage groups. Reductions in maternal weight gain occurred at dosages of 5 mg/kg/day or greater and reduction in embryo-fetal growth occurred in one study at a dosage of 10 mg/kg/day. No adverse maternal or embryo-fetal effects were observed in mice and rats following administration during organogenesis of oral doses up to 15 mg/kg/day or 40 mg/kg/day, respectively (4 and 20 times the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 20 and 100 times the maximum dose of 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis).</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">General Concerns and Considerations About Anticonvulsants</span></span><span class="Italics">:</span> Recent reports suggest an association between the use of anticonvulsant drugs by women with epilepsy and an elevated incidence of birth defects in children born to these women. Data are more extensive with respect to diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbital, but these are also the most commonly prescribed anticonvulsants; less systematic or anecdotal reports suggest a possible similar association with the use of all known anticonvulsant drugs.</p><p>In children of women treated with drugs for epilepsy, reports suggesting an elevated incidence of birth defects cannot be regarded as adequate to prove a definite cause and effect relationship. There are intrinsic methodologic problems in obtaining adequate data on drug teratogenicity in humans; the possibility also exists that other factors (eg, genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself) may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. The great majority of mothers on anticonvulsant medication deliver normal infants. It is important to note that anticonvulsant drugs should not be discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life. In individual cases where the severity and frequency of the seizure disorder are such that the removal of medication does not pose a serious threat to the patient, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy; however, it cannot be said with any confidence that even mild seizures do not pose some hazards to the developing embryo or fetus.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">General Concerns About Benzodiazepines:</span></span> An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of benzodiazepine drugs has been suggested in several studies.</p><p> </p><p>There may also be non-teratogenic risks associated with the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy. There have been reports of neonatal flaccidity, respiratory and feeding difficulties, and hypothermia in children born to mothers who have been receiving benzodiazepines late in pregnancy. In addition, children born to mothers receiving benzodiazepines late in pregnancy may be at some risk of experiencing withdrawal symptoms during the postnatal period.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Advice Regarding the Use of Clonazepam Orally Disintegrating Tablets in Women of Childbearing Potential:</span></span><span class="Italics"> </span>In general, the use of clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets in women of childbearing potential, and more specifically during known pregnancy, should be considered only when the clinical situation warrants the risk to the fetus.</p><p>The specific considerations addressed above regarding the use of anticonvulsants for epilepsy in women of childbearing potential should be weighed in treating or counseling these women.</p><p>Because of experience with other members of the benzodiazepine class, clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet is assumed to be capable of causing an increased risk of congenital abnormalities when administered to a pregnant woman during the first trimester. Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency in the treatment of panic disorder, their use during the first trimester should almost always be avoided. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Patients should also be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant, they should communicate with their physician about the desirability of discontinuing the drug.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Withdrawal Symptoms:</span></span> Withdrawal symptoms of the barbiturate type have occurred after the discontinuation of benzodiazepines (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General:</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Worsening of Seizures</span></span><span class="Italics">:</span> When used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal). This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets may produce absence status.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Laboratory Testing During Long-Term Therapy:</span></span><span class="Italics"> </span>Periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during long-term therapy with clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Risks of Abrupt Withdrawal:</span></span><span class="Italics"> </span>The abrupt withdrawal of clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets, particularly in those patients on long-term, high-dose therapy, may precipitate status epilepticus. Therefore, when discontinuing clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet gradual withdrawal is essential. While clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet is being gradually withdrawn, the simultaneous substitution of another anticonvulsant may be indicated.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Caution in Renally Impaired Patients:</span></span><span class="Italics"> </span>Metabolites of clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets are excreted by the kidneys; to avoid their excess accumulation, caution should be exercised in the administration of the drug to patients with impaired renal function.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Hypersalivation</span></span><span class="Italics">:</span> Clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets may produce an increase in salivation.

Patients should be instructed to take clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets only as prescribed. Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets:</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Risks from Concomitant Use With Opioids</span></span><span class="Italics">:</span> Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet is used with opioids and not to use such drugs concomitantly unless supervised by a health care provider (see WARNINGS: <span class="Italics">Risks from Concomitant Use With Opioids</span> and PRECAUTIONS: <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span>).</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Dose Changes</span></span><span class="Italics">:</span> To assure the safe and effective use of benzodiazepines, patients should be informed that, since benzodiazepines may produce psychological and physical dependence, it is advisable that they consult with their physician before either increasing the dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Interference With Cognitive and Motor Performance:</span></span><span class="Italics"> </span>Because benzodiazepines have the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets therapy does not affect them adversely.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Suicidal Thinking and Behavior:</span></span><span class="Italics"> </span>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy:</span></span><span class="Italics"> </span>Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets (see WARNINGS: <span class="Italics">Pregnancy Risks</span>). Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll free number 1-888-233-2334 (see PRECAUTIONS: <span class="Italics">Pregnancy</span>).</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Nursing</span></span><span class="Italics">:</span> Patients should be advised not to breastfeed an infant if they are taking clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Concomitant Medication</span></span><span class="Italics">:</span> Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Alcohol</span></span><span class="Italics">:</span> Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Phenylketonurics</span>:</span> Patients should be informed that clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each orally disintegrating tablet contains 0.56 mg phenylalanine.  </p><h3>Drug Interactions:</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Effect of Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines and Opioids</span>:</span> The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites, and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Effect of Clonazepam on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs</span></span><span class="Italics">:</span> Clonazepam does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital.

Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital, induce clonazepam metabolism, causing an approximately 30% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels. Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral antifungal agents, should be used cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamic Interactions</span></span><span class="Italics">:</span> The CNS-depressant action of the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be potentiated by alcohol, narcotics, barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, antianxiety agents, the phenothiazines, thioxanthene and butyrophenone classes of antipsychotic agents, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants, and by other anticonvulsant drugs.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with clonazepam.</p><p>The data currently available are not sufficient to determine the genotoxic potential of clonazepam.</p><p>In a two-generation fertility study in which clonazepam was given orally to rats at 10 and 100 mg/kg/day (low dose approximately 5 times and 24 times the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg/day for seizure disorder and 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis), there was a decrease in the number of pregnancies and in the number of offspring surviving until weaning.</p><h3>Pregnancy:</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects:</span></span> Pregnancy Category D (see WARNINGS: <span class="Italics">Pregnancy Risks</span>).</p><p>To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry.

Information on this registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery:</h3><p class="First">The effect of clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets on labor and delivery in humans has not been specifically studied; however, perinatal complications have been reported in children born to mothers who have been receiving benzodiazepines late in pregnancy, including findings suggestive of either excess benzodiazepine exposure or of withdrawal phenomena (see WARNINGS: <span class="Italics">Pregnancy Risks</span>).</p><h3>Nursing Mothers:</h3><p class="First">Mothers receiving clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets should not breastfeed their infants.</p><h3>Pediatric Use:</h3><p class="First">Because of the possibility that adverse effects on physical or mental development could become apparent only after many years, a benefit-risk consideration of the long-term use of clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet is important in pediatric patients being treated for seizure disorder (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p><p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with panic disorder below the age of 18 have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use:</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>Because clonazepam undergoes hepatic metabolism, it is possible that liver disease will impair clonazepam elimination. Metabolites of clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets are excreted by the kidneys; to avoid their excess accumulation, caution should be exercised in the administration of the drug to patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic and/or renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to assess hepatic and/or renal function at the time of dose selection.</p><p>Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets and observed closely.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The adverse experiences for clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets are provided separately for patients with seizure disorders and with panic disorder.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Seizure Disorders:</span></span> The most frequently occurring side effects of clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets are referable to CNS depression.

The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who received excessive doses over an extended period of time. Generally milder withdrawal symptoms (eg, dysphoria and insomnia) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently, after extended therapy, abrupt discontinuation should generally be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Addiction-prone individuals (such as drug addicts or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance when receiving clonazepam or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition of such patients to habituation and dependence.</p><p>Following the short-term treatment of patients with panic disorder in Studies 1 and 2 (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: <span class="Italics">Clinical Trials</span>), patients were gradually withdrawn during a 7-week downward-titration (discontinuance) period. Overall, the discontinuance period was associated with good tolerability and a very modest clinical deterioration, without evidence of a significant rebound phenomenon. However, there are not sufficient data from adequate and well-controlled long-term clonazepam studies in patients with panic disorder to accurately estimate the risks of withdrawal symptoms and dependence that may be associated with such use.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Human Experience:</span></span> Symptoms of clonazepam overdosage, like those produced by other CNS depressants, include somnolence, confusion, coma and diminished reflexes.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Overdose Management:</span></span> Treatment includes monitoring of respiration, pulse and blood pressure, general supportive measures and immediate gastric lavage. Intravenous fluids should be administered and an adequate airway maintained. Hypotension may be combated by the use of levarterenol or metaraminol. Dialysis is of no known value.</p><p>Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation and intravenous access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine overdose. Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for resedation, respiratory depression and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment. <span class="Bold">The prescriber should be aware of a risk of seizure in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose.</span> The complete flumazenil package insert, including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, should be consulted prior to use.</p><p><span class="Bold">Flumazenil is not indicated in patients with epilepsy who have been treated with benzodiazepines. Antagonism of the benzodiazepine effect in such patients may provoke seizures.</span></p><p>Serious sequelae are rare unless other drugs or alcohol have been taken concomitantly.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">Clonazepam is available as an orally disintegrating tablet. The orally disintegrating tablet should be administered as follows: After opening the carton, peel back the foil on the blister. Do not push tablet through foil. Immediately upon opening the blister, using dry hands, remove the tablet and place it in the mouth. Tablet disintegration occurs rapidly in saliva so it can be easily swallowed with or without water.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Seizure Disorders:</span></span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Adults:</span></span><span class="Italics"> </span>The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of</p><p>0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.</p><p>The use of multiple anticonvulsants may result in an increase of depressant adverse effects. This should be considered before adding clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets to an existing anticonvulsant regimen.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients:</span></span><span class="Italics"> </span>Clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets are administered orally. In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses. Dosage should be increased by no more than 0.25 to 0.5 mg every third day until a daily maintenance dose of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg of body weight has been reached, unless seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increase. Whenever possible, the daily dose should be divided into three equal doses. If doses are not equally divided, the largest dose should be given before retiring.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Geriatric Patients:</span></span><span class="Italics"> </span>There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets in seizure disorder patients 65 years of age and older.

An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days. The recommended dose of 1 mg/day is based on the results from a fixed dose study in which the optimal effect was seen at 1 mg/day. Higher doses of 2, 3 and 4 mg/day in that study were less effective than the 1 mg/day dose and were associated with more adverse effects. Nevertheless, it is possible that some individual patients may benefit from doses of up to a maximum dose of 4 mg/day, and in those instances, the dose may be increased in increments of 0.125 to 0.25 mg bid every 3 days until panic disorder is controlled or until side effects make further increases undesired. To reduce the inconvenience of somnolence, administration of one dose at bedtime may be desirable.</p><p>Treatment should be discontinued gradually, with a decrease of 0.125 mg bid every 3 days, until the drug is completely withdrawn.</p><p>There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with clonazepam should remain on it. Therefore, the physician who elects to use clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients:</span></span><span class="Italics"> </span>There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets in panic disorder patients under 18 years of age.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Geriatric Patients:</span> </span>There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam orally disintegrating tablets in panic disorder patients 65 years of age and older.
