This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For lurbinectedin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to lurbinectedin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of lurbinectedin injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of lurbinectedin injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have serious unwanted effects (eg, bone marrow problems), which may require caution in patients receiving lurbinectedin.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving lurbinectedin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using lurbinectedin with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of lurbinectedin</h2><p>Medicines used to treat cancer are very strong and can have many side effects. Before receiving lurbinectedin, make sure you understand all the risks and benefits. It is important for you to work closely with your doctor during your treatment.</p><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you lurbinectedin in a medical facility. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins.</p><p>Lurbinectedin must be given slowly, so the needle will have to remain in place for at least 60 minutes. It is usually given every 21 days.</p><p>You may also receive other medicines (eg, dexamethasone, ondansetron) to help prevent nausea and vomiting.</p><p>Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are receiving lurbinectedin.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using lurbinectedin</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress closely</i> while you are receiving lurbinectedin. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Receiving lurbinectedin while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. If you are a woman who can bear children, your doctor may give you a pregnancy test before you start receiving lurbinectedin to make sure you are not pregnant. Lurbinectedin may also cause birth defects if the father is receiving it when his sexual partner becomes pregnant. Female patients should use an effective form of birth control during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Male patients who have female partners should use effective birth control during treatment and for at least 4 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant or your partner has become pregnant while receiving lurbinectedin, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Lurbinectedin can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor right away if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever, chills, cough, hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Lurbinectedin side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
