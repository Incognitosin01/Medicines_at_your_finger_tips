Symptoms include headache, hunger, sweating, confusion, irritability, dizziness, or feeling shaky. Always keep a source of sugar with you in case you have low blood sugar. Sugar sources include fruit juice, hard candy, crackers, raisins, and non-diet soda. Be sure your family and close friends know how to help you in an emergency.</p><p>If you have severe hypoglycemia and cannot eat or drink, use a glucagon injection. Your doctor can prescribe a glucagon emergency injection kit and tell you how to use it.</p><p>Check your blood sugar carefully during times of stress, travel, illness, surgery or medical emergency, vigorous exercise, or if you drink alcohol or skip meals. These things can affect your glucose levels and your dose needs may also change. <b>Do not change your Avandaryl dose or dosing schedule without your doctor's advice.</b></p><p>Use Avandaryl regularly to get the most benefit. Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely.</p><p>This medicine is only part of a treatment program that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, blood sugar testing, vision exams, and special medical care.
