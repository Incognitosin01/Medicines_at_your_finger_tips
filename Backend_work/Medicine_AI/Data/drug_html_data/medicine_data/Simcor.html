Simcor is used along with diet to lower levels of total cholesterol, LDL "bad" cholesterol, and triglycerides and to increase HDL "good" cholesterol.</p><p>Niacin, also called nicotinic acid, is a B vitamin (vitamin B3). It occurs naturally in plants and animals, and is also added to many foods as a vitamin supplement. Niacin is also present in many multiple vitamins and nutritional supplements.</p><p>Simvastatin is in a group of drugs called HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, or "statins." Simvastatin reduces levels of "bad" cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) and triglycerides in the blood, while increasing levels of "good" cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not take Simcor if you are allergic to niacin or simvastatin, or if you have liver disease, stomach ulcer, or severe bleeding.</p><p><b>Do not use Simcor if you are pregnant.</b></p><p><b>Do not breast-feed while using this medicine.</b></p><p>The following drugs should not be used while you are taking Simcor: cyclosporine, danazol, nefazodone, gemfibrozil; clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin; fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole; amiodarone, diltiazem, verapamil; boceprevir, telaprevir; atazanavir, cobicistat, darunavir, delavirdine, fosamprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not take Simcor if you are allergic to niacin (Niaspan, Niacor, and others) or simvastatin (Zocor, Vytorin), or if you have:</p><ul>

</ul><p>liver disease;</p><p>stomach ulcer;</p><p>severe bleeding; or</p><p>if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><p>Simvastatin can cause a condition that results in the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, leading to kidney failure. This condition may be more likely to occur in women and older adults and in people who have kidney disease or poorly controlled hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).</p><p>The following drugs can increase your risk of serious muscle problems if you take them together with simvastatin.

These effects can be made worse if you drink alcohol or hot beverages shortly after you take Simcor. These effects should disappear over time as you keep taking the medicine.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend you take aspirin 30 minutes before you take Simcor to prevent certain side effects. Do not take aspirin without your doctor's advice.

You may need to start with a lower dose.</p><p>Niacin can raise your blood sugar, and may cause unusual results with certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using this medicine.</p><p>While using this medicine, you may need frequent blood tests.</p><p>You may need to take Simcor on a long-term basis for the treatment of high cholesterol. <b>Do not stop taking this medication unless your doctor tells you to.</b></p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Hyperlipidemia:</b></p><p>Initial (for patients not currently on niacin extended-release and patients currently on niacin products other than niacin extended-release): 500 mg-20 mg orally once daily at bedtime with a low fat snack.<br/>
<br/>
Patients already taking simvastatin 20 to 40 mg who need additional management of their lipid levels may be started on a Simcor dose of 500 mg-40 mg once daily at bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
Maintenance (depending on patient tolerability and lipid levels): 1000 mg-20 mg to 2000 mg-40 mg once daily at bedtime with a low fat snack<br/>
<br/>
The dose of niacin extended-release should not be increased by more than 500 mg daily every 4 weeks. The efficacy and safety of doses of Simcor greater than 2000 mg-40 mg daily have not been studied and are therefore not recommended. If therapy is discontinued for an extended period of time (greater than 7 days), re-titration as tolerated is recommended.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What to avoid</h2><p>Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may interact with simvastatin and lead to potentially dangerous effects. <b>Do not drink more than 1 quart of grapefruit juice daily.</b></p><p>If you also take cholestyramine (Prevalite, Questran) or colestipol (Colestid), avoid taking them within 4 to 6 hours before or after you take Simcor.</p><p>Avoid eating foods that are high in fat or cholesterol. Simcor will not be as effective in lowering your cholesterol if you do not follow a cholesterol-lowering diet plan.</p><p>Avoid drinking alcohol. It can raise triglyceride levels and may increase your risk of liver damage.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Simcor side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have any of these <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Simcor:</b> hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>In rare cases, simvastatin can cause a condition that results in the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, leading to kidney failure.
