Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever); vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia); bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; if the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM injection can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Brachial neuritis: Has occurred following tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines; use with caution (CDC/ACIP [Liang 2018]).</p><p>• Guillain-Barré syndrome: Use with caution if Guillain-Barré syndrome occurred within 6 weeks of prior tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine (CDC/ACIP [Liang 2018]).</p><p>• Neurologic disorders: Use with caution in patients with progressive neurologic disease including infantile spasms, uncontrolled seizure, or a progressive encephalopathy, or conditions predisposing to seizures; the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines recommend deferring immunization until health status can be assessed and condition stabilized (CDC/ACIP [Liang 2018]).</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Anticoagulant therapy: Use with caution in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy; bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; vaccinations should be administered prior to initiation of anticoagulation therapy if possible (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist. The use of combination vaccines is generally preferred over separate injections, taking into consideration provider assessment, patient preference, and adverse events. When using combination vaccines, the minimum age for administration is the oldest minimum age for any individual component; the minimum interval between dosing is the greatest minimum interval between any individual component. The ACIP prefers each dose of a specific vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer when possible; however, vaccination should not be deferred because a specific brand name is unavailable (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). Administration of Menactra (meningococcal MenACWY-D conjugate vaccine) one month after Daptacel has been shown to have reduced meningococcal antibody responses in children 4 to 6 years; these vaccines should be administered simultaneously or Menactra should be administered prior to Daptacel.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Consider deferring immunization during periods of severe immunosuppression (eg, patients receiving chemo/radiation therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy (including high dose corticosteroids); may have a reduced response to vaccination. May be used in patients with HIV infection. In general, household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive all age appropriate vaccines. Inactivated vaccines should be administered ≥2 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression when feasible; inactivated vaccines administered during chemotherapy should be readministered after immune competence is regained (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p>• Pediatric: Apnea has been reported following IM vaccine administration in premature infants; consider clinical status implications. In general, preterm infants should be vaccinated at the same chronological age as full-term infants (AAP [Saari 2003]; ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Adacel: Formulated with the same antigens found in Daptacel, but with reduced quantities of tetanus and pertussis. Use in the primary immunization series or to complete the primary series has not been evaluated.</p><p>• Boostrix: Formulated with the same antigens found in Infanrix, but in reduced quantities. Use in the primary immunization series or to complete the primary series has not been evaluated.</p><p>• Latex: Packaging may contain natural latex rubber.</p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Antipyretics: Per the manufacturer, antipyretic prophylaxis may be considered for patients at high risk for seizures. However, antipyretics have not been shown to prevent febrile seizures. Antipyretics may be used to treat fever or discomfort following vaccination (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). One study reported that routine prophylactic administration of acetaminophen to prevent fever prior to vaccination decreased the immune response of some vaccines; the clinical significance of this reduction in immune response has not been established (Prymula 2009).</p><p>• Appropriate use: Use of this vaccine for specific medical and/or other indications (eg, immunocompromising conditions, hepatic or kidney disease, diabetes) is also addressed in the annual ACIP Recommended Immunization Schedules (refer to CDC schedule for detailed information). Specific recommendations for vaccination in immunocompromised patients with asplenia, cancer, HIV infection, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, cochlear implants, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (prior to or after), sickle cell disease, solid organ transplant (prior to or after), or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for chronic conditions as well as contacts of immunocompromised patients are available from the IDSA (Rubin 2014).</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor for anaphylaxis and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>In general, maternal use of inactivated vaccines is not associated with increased risks to the fetus (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). In addition, an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, including miscarriage or major birth defects, has not been observed following maternal use of the Tdap vaccine (CDC [Havers 2020]; Moro 2016; Zheteyeva 2012).</p><p>All pregnant females should receive a single dose of Tdap during each pregnancy, regardless of previous vaccination status, preferably during the early part of 27 of 36 weeks gestation. Alternately, administration of Tdap can be given immediately postpartum to all females who have not previously been vaccinated with Tdap in order to protect the mother and infant from pertussis (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; CDC/ACIP [Liang 2018]). In case of an ongoing local pertussis epidemic, pregnant females should be vaccinated with Tdap for their own protection as is recommended for nonpregnant females, regardless of fetal gestational age. In addition, if a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine is needed as standard care for wound management, Tdap is preferred over Td, regardless of fetal gestational age if otherwise indicated. However, if Tdap is used prior to 27 to 36 weeks gestation in these instances, females should not receive more than 1 dose during the same pregnancy (ACOG 718 2017; CDC/ACIP [Havers 2020]).</p><p>Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes following exposure to Tdap vaccine is ongoing. Pregnancy registries have been established for females who may become exposed to Boostrix (888-452-9622) or Adacel (800-822-2463) while pregnant.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to prevent diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
