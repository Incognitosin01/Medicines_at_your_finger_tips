</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Vardenafil ODT</h2><p class="First">Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets are indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.</p><h2>Vardenafil ODT Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets are available in 10 mg orally disintegrating tablets. Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets are not interchangeable with vardenafil 10 mg film-coated tablets (LEVITRA). Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets provide higher systemic exposure compared to vardenafil 10 mg film-coated tablets (LEVITRA)  <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]</span></p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets should be taken orally, as needed, approximately 60 minutes before sexual activity. The maximum dosing frequency is one vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablet per day. Sexual stimulation is required for a response to treatment.</p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets should be placed on the tongue where it will disintegrate. The tablet should be taken without liquid. It should be taken immediately upon removal from the blister.</p><p>Those patients who require a lower or higher dose of vardenafil need to be prescribed vardenafil film-coated tablets <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Use with Food</h3><p class="First">Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets can be taken with or without food.</p><h3>Use in Special Populations</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hepatic Impairment:</span> Do not use vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment:</span> Do not use vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets in patients on renal dialysis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Concomitant Medications</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nitrates:</span> Concomitant use with nitrates in any form is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators, such as riociguat</span>: Concomitant use is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.2)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">CYP3A4 Inhibitors:</span> Do not use vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets with potent or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin and erythromycin <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Alpha-Blockers:</span> In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended starting dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure in patients taking a phosphodiesterase (PDE5) inhibitor including vardenafil. In patients taking alpha-blockers, do not initiate vardenafil therapy with vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets. Lower doses of vardenafil film-coated tablets should be used as initial therapy in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>. Patients taking alpha-blockers who have previously used vardenafil film-coated tablets may change to vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets at the advice of their healthcare provider  <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span> and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.1).]</span></p><p>A time interval between dosing should be considered when vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets are prescribed concomitantly with alpha-blocker therapy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span> </p><p> </p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets are available in 10 mg white to off white, round, biconvex, debossed with “477”.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Nitrates</h3><p class="First">Administration of vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets with nitrates (either regularly and/or intermittently) and nitric oxide donors is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. Consistent with the effects of PDE5 inhibition on the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway, PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets, may potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates. A suitable time interval following vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets dosing for the safe administration of nitrates or nitric oxide donors has not been determined.</p><h3>Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators</h3><p class="First">Do not use vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets in patients who are using a GC stimulator, such as riociguat. PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets may potentiate the hypotensive effects of GC stimulators.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><p class="First">The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a medical assessment, a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment.</p><p>Before prescribing vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets, it is important to note the following:</p><h3>Cardiovascular Effects</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">General</span> </p><p>Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatment for erectile dysfunction, including vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is not recommended because of their underlying cardiovascular status.</p><p>There are no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of vardenafil in the following patients; and therefore its use is not recommended until further information is available: unstable angina; hypotension (resting systolic blood pressure of &lt;90 mmHg); uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;170/110 mmHg); recent history of stroke, life-threatening arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction (within the last 6 months); severe cardiac failure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Left Ventricular Outflow Obstruction</span> </p><p>Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction (for example, aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators including PDE5 inhibitors.</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood Pressure Effects</span> </p><p>Vardenafil has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 7 mmHg systolic and 8 mmHg diastolic) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects.</p><h3>Potential for Drug Interactions with Potent or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, indinavir, ketoconazole) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as erythromycin) increases plasma concentrations of vardenafil. Do not use vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets in patients taking potent or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors  <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Interactions (7.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17).]</span></p><h3>Risk of Priapism</h3><p class="First">There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds, including vardenafil. In the event that an erection persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may result.</p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets should be used with caution by patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie’s disease) or by patients who have conditions that may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia).</p><h3>Effects on the Eye</h3><p class="First">Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets, and seek medical attention in the event of sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a rare condition and a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision, that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. Based on published literature, the annual incidence of NAION is 2.5 to 11.8 cases per 100,000 in males aged ≥50.<br/>
An observational case-crossover study evaluated the risk of NAION when PDE5 inhibitor use, as a class, occurred immediately before NAION onset (within 5 half-lives), compared to PDE5 inhibitor use in a prior time period. The results suggest an approximate 2-fold increase in the risk of NAION, with a risk estimate of 2.15 (95% CI 1.06, 4.34). A similar study reported a consistent result, with a risk estimate of 2.27 (95% CI 0.99, 5.2). Other risk factors for NAION, such as the presence of “crowded” optic disc, may have contributed to the occurrence of NAION in these studies.</p><p>Neither the rare postmarketing reports, nor the association of PDE5 inhibitor use and NAION in the observational studies, substantiate a causal relationship between PDE5 inhibitor use and NAION <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].<br/></span></p><p>Physicians should consider whether their patients with underlying NAION risk factors could be adversely affected by use of PDE5 inhibitors. Individuals who have already experienced NAION are at increased risk of NAION recurrence. Therefore, PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets, should be used with caution in these patients and only when the anticipated benefits outweigh the risks. Individuals with “crowded” optic disc are also considered at greater risk for NAION compared to the general population, however, evidence is insufficient to support screening of prospective users of PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets, for this uncommon condition.</p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets have not been evaluated in patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, therefore its use is not recommended until further information is available in those patients.</p><h3>Sudden Hearing Loss</h3><p class="First">Physicians should advise patients to stop taking all PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Alpha-Blockers</h3><p class="First">In patients taking alpha-blockers, do not initiate vardenafil therapy with vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets. Patients treated with alpha-blockers who have previously used vardenafil film-coated tablets may be changed to vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets at the advice of their healthcare provider. Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span> leading to symptomatic hypotension (for example, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following:</p><p>·           Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.</p><p>·           In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended starting dose. In patients taking alpha-blockers, do not initiate vardenafil therapy with vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets. Lower doses of vardenafil film-coated tablets should be used as initial therapy in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><p>·           In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increases in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure in patients taking a PDE5 inhibitor.</p><p>Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs.</p><h3>Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">In a study of the effect of vardenafil on QT interval in 59 healthy males <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>, therapeutic (10 mg film-coated tablets) and supratherapeutic (80 mg) doses of vardenafil and the active control moxifloxacin (400 mg) produced similar increases in QTc interval. A postmarketing study evaluating the effect of combining vardenafil with another drug of comparable QT effect showed an additive QT effect when compared with either drug alone <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions when prescribing vardenafil to patients with known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval.</p><p>Patients taking Class 1A (for example, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (for example, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications or those with congenital QT prolongation, should avoid using vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Do not use vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Do not use vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets in patients on renal dialysis, as vardenafil has not been evaluated in this population <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].</span></p><h3>Combination with Other Erectile Dysfunction Therapies</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets used in combination with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended.</p><h3>Effects on Bleeding</h3><p class="First">In humans, vardenafil film-coated tablet alone in doses up to 20 mg does not prolong the bleeding time. There is no clinical evidence of any additive prolongation of the bleeding time when vardenafil is administered with aspirin. Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets have not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Therefore vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets should be administered to these patients after careful benefit-risk assessment.</p><h3>Phenylketonurics</h3><p class="First">Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria. Phenylketonurics: Each vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablet contains 1.403 mg phenylalanine per tablet.</p><h3>Sexually Transmitted Disease</h3><p class="First">Use of vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling of patients about protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), should be considered.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions with the use of vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><p>·            Cardiovascular effects <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></p><p>·            Priapism <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></p><p>·            QT Prolongation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span></p><p>·            Effects on eye <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></p><p>·            Sudden hearing loss <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span></p><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Vardenafil Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets</span>: Safety of vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets were evaluated in two identical multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In both pivotal studies, enrollment was stratified so that approximately 50% of patients were ≥65 years old. Approximately 8% (n=29) were ≥75 years old. An integrated analysis of both studies included a total of 355 subjects that received vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets compared to 340 subjects that received placebo (mean age was 61.7, range 21 to 88; 68% White, 5% Black, 6% Asian, 11% Hispanic and 11% Other). The discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 1.4% for vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets compared to 0.6% for placebo. Table 1 below details the most frequently reported adverse reactions.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Adverse drug reactions reported by ≥2% of the patients treated with vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets and more frequent on drug than placebo in controlled trials</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>Adverse drug reactions reported in the vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets placebo controlled trials were comparable to the adverse drug reactions reported in earlier vardenafil film-coated tablets placebo controlled trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">All Vardenafil Studies:</span> Vardenafil film-coated tablets and vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets have been administered to over 17,000 men (mean age 54.5, range 18 to 89 years; 70% White, 5% Black, 13% Asian, 4% Hispanic and 8% Other) during controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials worldwide. The number of patients treated for 6 months or longer was 3357, and 1350 patients were treated for at least 1 year.</p><p>In the placebo-controlled clinical trials for vardenafil film-coated tablets and vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets, the discontinuation rate due to adverse events was 1.9% for vardenafil compared to 0.8% for placebo.</p><p>Placebo-controlled trials suggested a dose effect in the incidence of some adverse reactions (for example, dizziness, headache, flushing, dyspepsia, nausea, nasal congestion) over the 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg doses of vardenafil film-coated tablets.</p><p>The following section identifies additional, less frequent adverse reactions (&lt;2%) reported during the clinical development of vardenafil film-coated tablets and vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets. Excluded from this list are those adverse reactions that are infrequent and minor, those events that may be commonly observed in the absence of drug therapy, and those events that are not reasonably associated with the drug:</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Body as a whole:</span> allergic edema and angioedema, feeling unwell, allergic reactions, chest pain</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Auditory:</span> tinnitus, vertigo</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular:</span> palpitation, tachycardia, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, hypotension</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Digestive:</span> nausea, gastrointestinal and abdominal pain, dry mouth, diarrhea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, vomiting, increase in transaminases</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Musculoskeletal:</span> increase in creatine phosphokinase (CPK), increased muscle tone and cramping, myalgia</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Nervous:</span> paresthesia and dysesthesia, somnolence, sleep disorder, syncope, amnesia, seizure</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Respiratory:</span> dyspnea, sinus congestion</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Skin and appendages:</span> erythema, rash</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Ophthalmologic:</span> visual disturbance, ocular hyperemia, visual color distortions, eye pain and eye discomfort, photophobia, increase in intraocular pressure, conjunctivitis</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Urogenital:</span> increase in erection, priapism</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of vardenafil in the film-coated tablet formulation. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Ophthalmologic:</span> Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio (“crowded disc”), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia and smoking <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><p>Visual disturbances including vision loss (temporary or permanent), such as visual field defect, retinal vein occlusion, and reduced visual acuity, have also been reported rarely in postmarketing experience. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of vardenafil.</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Neurologic:</span> Seizure, seizure recurrence and transient global amnesia have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with vardenafil.</p><p><span class="Bold">Otologic:</span> Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil. In some cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of vardenafil, to the patient’s underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">The drug interaction studies described below were conducted using vardenafil film-coated tablets.</p><h3>Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with Vardenafil Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nitrates:</span> Concomitant use of vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets and nitrates is contraindicated. The blood pressure lowering effects of sublingual nitrates (0.4 mg) taken 1 and 4 hours after vardenafil and increases in heart rate when taken at 1, 4 and 8 hours after vardenafil were potentiated by a 20 mg dose of vardenafil in healthy middle-aged subjects. These effects were not observed when vardenafil 20 mg was taken 24 hours before the nitroglycerin (NTG). Potentiation of the hypotensive effects of nitrates for patients with ischemic heart disease has not been evaluated, and concomitant use of vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets and nitrates is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Alpha-Blockers:</span> Patients taking alpha-blockers should not initiate vardenafil therapy with vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets. Patients treated with alpha-blockers who have previously used vardenafil film-coated tablets may be switched to vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets at the advice of their healthcare provider. Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with co-administration of vardenafil with alfuzosin, terazosin or tamsulosin  <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2).]</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Antihypertensives:</span> Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets may add to the blood pressure lowering effect of antihypertensive agents. In a clinical pharmacology study of patients with erectile dysfunction, single doses of 20 mg vardenafil caused a mean maximum decrease in supine blood pressure of 7 mmHg systolic and 8 mmHg diastolic (compared to placebo), accompanied by a mean maximum increase of heart rate of 4 beats per minute. The maximum decrease in blood pressure occurred between 1 and 4 hours after dosing. Following multiple dosing for 31 days, similar blood pressure responses were observed on Day 31 as on Day 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Alcohol:</span> Vardenafil 20 mg did not potentiate the hypotensive effects of alcohol during the 4-hour observation period in healthy volunteers when administered with alcohol (0.5 g/kg body weight: approximately 40 mL of absolute alcohol in a 70 kg person). Alcohol and vardenafil plasma levels were not altered when dosed simultaneously.</p><h3>Effect of Other Drugs on Vardenafil</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro studies</span> </p><p>Studies in human liver microsomes showed that vardenafil is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4/5, and to a lesser degree by CYP2C9.

This monohydrochloride salt of vardenafil is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific PDE5.</p><p>Vardenafil HCl, USP is designated chemically as piperazine, 1-[[3-(1,4-dihydro-5-methyl-4-oxo-7-propylimidazo[5,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-2-yl)-4-ethoxyphenyl]sulfonyl]-4-ethyl-, monohydrochloride and has the following structural formula:<br/>
<br/>
Vardenafil HCl, USP is a white or slightly brown or yellow powder with a molecular weight of 579.1. It is slightly soluble in water, freely soluble in anhydrous Ethanol. Practically insoluble in heptane.</p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets are formulated as white to off white, round, orally disintegrating tablets. Each tablet contains 11.85 mg vardenafil hydrochloride USP (in trihydrate form), which is equivalent to 10 mg vardenafil and the following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, aspartame, citric acid monohydrate, NAT Peppermint FL WONF SD #491, sodium stearyl fumarate and magnesium stearate.</p><h2>Vardenafil ODT - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Penile erection is a hemodynamic process initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP in turn triggers smooth muscle relaxation, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in erection. The tissue concentration of cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is the cGMP-specific PDE5; therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Because sexual stimulation is required to initiate the local release of nitric oxide, the inhibition of PDE5 has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that vardenafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. The inhibitory effect of vardenafil is more selective on PDE5 than for other known phosphodiesterases (&gt;15-fold relative to PDE6, &gt;130-fold relative to PDE1, &gt;300-fold relative to PDE11, and &gt;1,000-fold relative to PDE2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10).</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacodynamic studies described below were conducted using vardenafil film-coated tablets.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on Blood Pressure</span> </p><p>In a clinical pharmacology study of patients with erectile dysfunction, single doses of vardenafil 20 mg film-coated tablets caused a mean maximum decrease in supine blood pressure of 7 mmHg systolic and 8 mmHg diastolic (compared to placebo), accompanied by a mean maximum increase of heart rate of 4 beats per minute. The maximum decrease in blood pressure occurred between 1 and 4 hours after dosing. Following multiple dosing for 31 days, similar blood pressure responses were observed on Day 31 as on Day 1.

In a study of healthy male volunteers (18 to 50 years), the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of vardenafil from vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets were higher by 15% and 44%, respectively compared to 10 mg vardenafil film-coated tablets.</p><p>Vardenafil was not found to accumulate in plasma when vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets was dosed daily over ten days.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of food:</span> A high fat meal had no effect on vardenafil AUC and T<span class="Sub">max</span> from vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets in healthy volunteers and reduced Cmax by 35%. Clinical trials for vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets were conducted without regard to meals. Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets can be taken with or without food.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of water:</span> When vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets were swallowed with water, the AUC of vardenafil was reduced by 29% and median T<span class="Sub">max</span> was shortened by 60 minutes while C<span class="Sub">max</span> was not affected. In clinical trials, dosing was done without water. Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets should be taken without liquid.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution<br/></span> The mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) for vardenafil is 208 L, indicating extensive tissue distribution. Vardenafil and its major circulating metabolite, M1, are highly bound to plasma proteins (about 95% for parent drug and M1). This protein binding is reversible and independent of total drug concentrations.</p><p>Following a single oral dose of 20 mg vardenafil film-coated tablet in healthy volunteers, a mean of 0.00018% of the administered dose was obtained in semen 1.5 hours after dosing.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism<br/></span> Vardenafil is metabolized predominantly by the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4, with contribution from the CYP3A5 and CYP2C isoforms. The major circulating metabolite, M1, results from desethylation at the piperazine moiety of vardenafil. M1 is subject to further metabolism. The plasma concentration of M1 is approximately 26% that of the parent compound. This metabolite shows a phosphodiesterase selectivity profile similar to that of vardenafil and an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> inhibitory potency for PDE5 28% of that of vardenafil. Therefore, M1 accounts for approximately 7% of total pharmacologic activity.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span><br/>
The mean terminal half-life of vardenafil in patients receiving vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets varied between about 4 to 6 hours. The elimination half-life of the metabolite M1 is between 3 to 5 hours. After oral administration, vardenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 91 to 95% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 2 to 6% of administered oral dose). Vardenafil is a high clearance drug with a plasma clearance of 56.4 L/h following intravenous administration.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatrics<br/></span> Vardenafil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients.
