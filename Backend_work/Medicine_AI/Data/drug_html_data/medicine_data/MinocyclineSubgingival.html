Periodontal disease is caused by bacteria growing beneath the gum line. Minocycline works by keeping the number of bacteria from growing. Lowering the amount of bacteria helps to reduce inflammation and swelling in your mouth, and the amount of bleeding around the teeth. Minocycline is placed in deep gum pockets next to your teeth in order to reduce the depth of the pockets.</p><p>Minocycline will be applied by your dentist or other oral health care professional.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using minocycline</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For minocycline, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to minocycline or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.
