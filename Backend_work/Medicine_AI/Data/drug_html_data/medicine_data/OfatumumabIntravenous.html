It is also used in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to treat patients with relapsed CLL. Ofatumumab is also used in patients with CLL who have already been treated with other medicines (eg, alemtuzumab, fludarabine) that did not work well.</p><p>Ofatumumab injection is also used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. Ofatumumab will not cure MS, but it may slow some of the disabling effects and decrease the number of relapses of the disease.</p><p>Ofatumumab interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by ofatumumab, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Some unwanted effects, such as a skin rash, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some of the unwanted effects do not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.</p><p>Before you begin treatment with ofatumumab, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits ofatumumab will do as well as the risks of using it.</p><p><i>Arzerra®</i> is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor. <i>Kesimpta®</i> is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using ofatumumab</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For ofatumumab, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to ofatumumab or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of ofatumumab injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ofatumumab injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted side effects (eg, neutropenia, pneumonia) which may require caution.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of ofatumumab</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you ofatumumab in a medical facility. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins or as a shot under your skin, usually on the front of your thighs, stomach, or upper arms.</p><p><i>Arzerra®</i> needs to be given slowly, so the needle will remain in place for at least an hour. You may also receive medicines to help prevent allergic reactions.</p><p>Ofatumumab comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p><i>Kesimpta®</i> may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital or clinic. If you are using ofatumumab at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you how to prepare and inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand how to use the medicine.</p><p>You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems. Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, bruised, red, scaly, or hard, or areas with moles, scars, or stretch marks.</p><p>Remove the prefilled syringe or pen from the refrigerator before using. Allow the medicine to warm to room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes. Do not remove the needle cover while allowing to reach room temperature.</p><p>Check the liquid in the prefilled syringe or pen. It should be clear to slightly cloudy and colorless to slightly brownish-yellow. Do not use it if it is cloudy, discolored, or has particles in it. Do not shake. Do not use the prefilled syringe or pen if it has been damaged, broken, or if you dropped it with the cap removed.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of ofatumumab will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of ofatumumab. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.

Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Using ofatumumab while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose of ofatumumab. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Ofatumumab may cause chest pain, fever, chills, itching, hives, flushing of the face, rash, dizziness, fainting, or lightheadedness, trouble breathing, or swelling of the face, tongue, and throat within a few hours after you receive it. Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you have any of these symptoms.</p><p>Ofatumumab may cause a serious type of reaction called tumor lysis syndrome. Your doctor may give you a medicine to help prevent this. Call your doctor right away if you have a decrease or change in urine amount, joint pain, stiffness, or swelling, lower back, side, or stomach pain, a rapid weight gain, swelling of the feet or lower legs, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Ofatumumab can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>Ofatumumab may increase your risk of developing a serious and rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Check with your doctor right away if you have vision changes, loss of coordination, clumsiness, memory loss, difficulty speaking or understanding what others say, and weakness in the legs.</p><p>Ofatumumab may cause hepatitis B virus reactivation. Check with your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of liver problems, such as yellow skin or eyes, dark brown-colored urine, right-sided stomach pain, fever, or severe tiredness.</p><p>Do not have any live vaccines (immunizations) while you are being treated with ofatumumab injection. You should have completed any needed immunizations at least 4 weeks for live or live-attenuated vaccines and at least 2 weeks for non-live (inactivated) vaccines before starting treatment with ofatumumab. Check with your doctor before having any vaccines.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless thy have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Ofatumumab side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
