Each weight marking on the syringe plunger delivers enough paste to treat 250 lb body weight. (1) While holding plunger, turn the knurled ring on the plunger 1/4 turn to the left and slide it so the side nearest the barrel is at the prescribed weight marking. (2) Lock the ring in place by making a 1/4 turn to the right. (3) Make sure that the horse's mouth contains no feed. (4) Remove the cover from the tip of the syringe. (5) Insert the syringe tip into the horse's mouth at the space between the teeth. (6) Depress the plunger as far as it will go, depositing paste on the back of the tongue. (7) Immediately raise the horse's head for a few seconds after dosing.</p><h2>PARASITE CONTROL PROGRAM</h2><p class="First">All horses should be included in a regular parasite control program with particular attention being paid to mares, foals and yearlings. Foals should be treated initially at 6 to 8 weeks of age, and routine treatment repeated as appropriate. Consult your veterinarian for a control program to meet your specific needs. Zimecterin<span class="Sup">®</span> (ivermectin) Paste effectively controls gastrointestinal nematodes and bots of horses. Regular treatment will reduce the chances of verminous arteritis caused by <span class="Italics">Strongylus vulgaris.</span></p><h2>PRODUCT ADVANTAGES</h2><h3>Broad-spectrum Control</h3><p class="First">Zimecterin<span class="Sup">®</span> Paste kills important internal parasites, including bots and the arterial stages of <span class="Italics">S. vulgaris</span>, with a single dose. Zimecterin<span class="Sup">®</span> Paste is a potent antiparasitic agent that is neither a benzimidazole nor an organophosphate.</p><h2>ANIMAL SAFETY</h2><p class="First">Zimecterin<span class="Sup">®</span> (ivermectin) Paste may be used in horses of all ages, including mares at any stage of pregnancy.

These reactions were most likely the result of microfilariae dying in large numbers. Symptomatic treatment may be advisable. Consult your veterinarian should any such reactions occur.
