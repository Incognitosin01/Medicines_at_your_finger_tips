The medicine is contained in a small plastic rod that is implanted into the skin of your upper arm. The medicine is released slowly into the body. The rod can remain in place and provide continuous contraception for up to 3 years.</p><p>Etonogestrel implant may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use if you are pregnant or if you have recently had a baby.</b></p><p><b>You should not use an etonogestrel implant if you have:</b> undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, liver disease or liver cancer, if you will have major surgery, or if you have ever had a heart attack, a stroke, a blood clot, or cancer of the breast, uterus/cervix, or vagina.</p><p>Using an etonogestrel implant can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</p><p><b>Smoking can greatly increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</b> You should not smoke while using an etonogestrel implant.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Using an etonogestrel implant can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack. You are even more at risk if you have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or if you are overweight. Your risk of stroke or blood clot is highest during your first year of using  etonogestrel.</p><p><b>Smoking can greatly increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</b> Your risk increases the older you are and the more you smoke.</p><p><b>Do not use if you are pregnant.</b> If you become pregnant, the etonogestrel implant should be removed if you plan to continue the pregnancy.</p><p>You may need to have a negative pregnancy test before receiving the implant.</p><p>You should not use hormonal birth control if you have:</p><ul>

Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding.</p><h2>How is the etonogestrel implant used?</h2><p>The timing of when you will receive this implant depends on whether you were using birth control before, and what type it was.</p><p>Etonogestrel implant is inserted through a needle (under local anesthesia) into the skin of your upper arm, just inside and above the elbow. After the implant is inserted, your arm will be covered with 2 bandages. Remove the top bandage after 24 hours, but leave the smaller bandage on for 3 to 5 days. Keep the area clean and dry.</p><p>You should be able to feel the implant under your skin. Tell your doctor if you cannot feel the implant at any time while it is in place.</p><p>Etonogestrel implant can remain in place for up to 3 years. If the implant is placed correctly, you will not need to use back-up birth control. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>You may have irregular and unpredictable periods while using the etonogestrel implant. Tell your doctor if your periods are very heavy or long-lasting, or if you miss a period (you may be pregnant).</p><p><b>If you need major surgery or will be on long-term bed rest, or if you need medical tests</b> your etonogestrel implant may need to be removed for a short time. Any doctor or surgeon who treats you should know that you have an etonogestrel implant.</p><p>Have regular physical exams and mammograms, and self-examine your breasts for lumps on a monthly basis while using this medicine.</p><p>The etonogestrel implant must be removed by the end of the third year after it was inserted and may be replaced at that time with a new implant. After the implant is removed, your ability to get pregnant will return quickly. If the implant is not replaced with a new one, start using another form of birth control right away if you wish to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if it feels like the implant may be bent or broken while it is in your arm.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since etonogestrel is given as an implant by a healthcare professional, you will not be on a frequent dosing schedule. Be sure to see your doctor for removal of the implant by the end of the third year.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>If the implant is correctly inserted, an overdose of etonogestrel is highly unlikely.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking etonogestrel implant?</h2><p><b>You should not smoke while using an etonogestrel implant.</b></p><p>Etonogestrel implant will not protect you from sexually transmitted diseases--including HIV and AIDS. Using a condom is the only way to protect yourself from these diseases.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Etonogestrel implant side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction</b>: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
