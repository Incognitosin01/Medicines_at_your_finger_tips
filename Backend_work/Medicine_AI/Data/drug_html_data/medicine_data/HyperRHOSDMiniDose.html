Rh is a substance that most people have in their blood (Rh positive) but some people don't (Rh negative). A person who is Rh negative can be exposed to Rh positive blood through a mismatched blood transfusion or during pregnancy when the baby has the opposite blood type. When this exposure happens, the Rh negative blood will respond by making antibodies that will try to destroy the Rh positive blood cells. This can cause medical problems such as anemia (low red blood cells), kidney failure, or shock.</p><p>HyperRHO S/D Mini Dose is used to prevent an immune response to Rh positive blood in people with an Rh negative blood type. This medicine may also be used in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).</p><p>HyperRHO S/D Mini Dose may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive  HyperRHO S/D Mini Dose if you have immune globulin A (IgA) deficiency with antibody to IgA, or if you have hemolytic anemia (a lack of red blood cells).</p><p>RHo(D) immune globulin can cause an abnormal breakdown of red blood cells. This effect can lead to life-threatening blood clots or organ failure.</p><p><b>Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms:</b> fever, chills, back pain, unusual weakness, red or pink urine, pale skin, feeling short of breath, little or no urinating, rapid weight gain, sudden numbness or weakness, slurred speech, problems with vision or balance, coughing up blood, or swelling or warmth in your leg.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive this medicine if you have ever had an allergic reaction to an immune globulin, or if you have:</p><ul>

This medicine is not known to be harmful to a baby during pregnancy or while breast-feeding.</p><p>If you are receiving this medication to treat a mismatched blood transfusion, tell your doctor if you are pregnant or if you ever plan to become pregnant.</p><p><b>If you are an Rh-negative woman and you become pregnant, you must tell your doctor if you have ever been exposed to Rh-positive blood in your lifetime.</b> This includes exposure from a mismatched blood transfusion, or exposure during your first pregnancy. Your history of exposure and treatment will be extremely important to each and every one of your pregnancies.</p><p>HyperRHO S/D Mini Dose is made from human plasma (part of the blood) which may contain viruses and other infectious agents. Donated plasma is tested and treated to reduce the risk of it containing infectious agents, but there is still a small possibility it could transmit disease. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of using this medication.</p><h2>How is  HyperRHO S/D Mini Dose given?</h2><p>HyperRHO S/D Mini Dose is injected into a muscle or a vein. You will receive this injection in a clinic or hospital setting.</p><p>Your breathing, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and other vital signs will be watched closely after you receive immune globulin. Your urine may also need to be tested every 2 to 4 hours for at least 8 hours.</p><p>For treatment during pregnancy,  HyperRHO S/D Mini Dose is usually given at regular intervals during the last half of the pregnancy, and again after the baby is born.</p><p>For treatment of a mismatched blood transfusion, the medicine is given when symptoms of an immune response appear (when the body starts making Rh antibodies).</p><p>To be sure this medicine is helping your condition, you may need frequent blood tests. You may not notice any change in your symptoms, but your blood work will help your doctor determine how long to treat you with HyperRHO S/D Mini Dose.</p><p>HyperRHO S/D Mini Dose can cause false results with certain lab tests for glucose (sugar) in the blood. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using this medicine.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss an appointment for your  HyperRHO S/D Mini Dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while receiving  HyperRHO S/D Mini Dose?</h2><p>Do not receive a "live" vaccine for at least 3 months after treatment with HyperRHO S/D Mini Dose.
