</ul><h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2><p class="First">Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span> Injection (liver derivative complex) is a sterile solution containing 25.5mg liver derivative complex per ml in sterile water for injection.</p><p><br/>
Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span> Injection is composed of peptides and amino acids. The product contains no protein and does not exhibit anti-anemia activity.</p><p><br/>
Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span> Injection also contains as inactive ingredients: phenol 0.5%, sterile water for Injection, pH is adjusted with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide when necessary.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOI.OGY:</h2><p class="First">The specific action of Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span> is to enhance the resolution of inflammation and edema. In the late 1920's, it was demonstrated that liver was of benefit to patients suffering from acne vulgaris. <span class="Sup">1</span> As a consequence, various techniques were employed for isolating the active "factor" from liver. Studies published in the late 1930's and early 1940's <span class="Sup">2,3,4</span> showed activity in a specially purified liver fraction. During subsequent years, refinements in the isolation of the active material led to the marketing of Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span>.</p><p><br/>
Initially it was thought that the primary action of Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span> was on the capillaries and precapillary sphincters. However, it is now believed that this effect is a secondary one and that the primary action of Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span> is in response to injury at the cellular level. The capillary changes observed following administration of Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span> appear to be part of a more fundamental anti-inflammatory effect. In the normal animal, no consistent pharmacodynamic action has been demonstrated for Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span>. In particular, there is no effect on systemic blood pressure, no action on the autonomic nervous system and no alteration in prothrombin, coagulation or bleeding times. It is concluded that the specific action of the product is only apparent when tissues have been subjected to injury and when inflammation and edema are present.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First">A wide range of dermatological clinical conditions benefit from Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span> therapy. The common denominator in these varied conditions is the presence of inflammation and edema. Favourable responses to the administration of Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span> in patients with acne vulgaris <span class="Sup">5,6,7,8,</span> herpes zoster, "poison ivy" dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, seborrheic dermatitis, urticaria and eczema <span class="Sup">9,10,11</span>, severe sunburn <span class="Sup">12</span> and rosacea <span class="Sup">13</span> have been reported.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity or intolerance to liver or pork products.</p><h2>WARNING:</h2><p class="First">Use with caution in patients suspected of being hypersensitive to liver or with other allergic diatheses.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span></span><br/>
Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span> contains tyramine and should not be administered to patients taking MAO inhibitors because hypertensive crisis may occur.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span></span><br/>
No long-term animal studies have examined the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span>. Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span>s effect upon reproductive capacity is similarly unknown.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy- Pregnancy Category C:</span></span><br/>
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span>. It is also not known whether Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span> can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span> should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span></span><br/>
It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.

Local reactions may include pain. rash, stinging, swelling, and erythema.</p><h2>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE:</h2><p class="First">The Information on drug abuse and dependence is limited to uncontrolled data derived from marketing experience. Such experience has revealed no evidence of drug abuse and dependence associated with Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span> Injection.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First">For the management of skin disorders, the usual dose of Nexavir <span class="Sup">®</span> is 2 ml administered daily or as indicated. The product is given by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection only.</p><p><br/>
