In such patients, use a maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg <span class="Italics">[see</span></span> <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.1)</span> <span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Italics">and</span></span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.1)</span><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Italics">]</span>.</span></p><h3>Dyspnea</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with BRILINTA developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients.</span></p><p>In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment.</p><p>If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to BRILINTA, no specific treatment is required; continue BRILINTA without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of BRILINTA, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent.</p><h3>Discontinuation of BRILINTA in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Discontinuation of BRILINTA will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If BRILINTA must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with BRILINTA for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume BRILINTA as soon as hemostasis is achieved.</span></p><h3>Bradyarrhythmias</h3><p class="First">BRILINTA can cause ventricular pauses <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor.</p><h3>Severe Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Avoid use of BRILINTA in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of BRILINTA patients with severe hepatic impairment [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Laboratory Test Interferences</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)</span></p><p>BRILINTA has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (to include, but may not be limited to, the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y12-receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient’s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with BRILINTA is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of BRILINTA interference, BRILINTA is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>BRILINTA has been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients.</p><p><span class="Italics">Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS)</span></p><p>Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO)</span></p><p>Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other haemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.</p><p>T Ticagrelor;

Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for BRILINTA and in 2 for placebo.</p><p><span class="Italics">Bradycardia</span></p><p>In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with BRILINTA (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker).</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Lab abnormalities</span></span></p><p>Serum Uric Acid:</p><p>In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on BRILINTA 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group).</p><p>In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on BRILINTA 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on BRILINTA than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped.</p><p>Serum Creatinine:</p><p>In PLATO, a &gt;50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving BRILINTA 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria.</p><p>In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by &gt;50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving BRILINTA 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of BRILINTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood and lymphatic system disorders:</span> Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of BRILINTA.

Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists.</p><h3>Simvastatin, Lovastatin</h3><p class="First">BRILINTA increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Digoxin</h3><p class="First">BRILINTA inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in BRILINTA therapy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available data from case reports with BRILINTA use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>).</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred.</p><p>In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of ticagrelor or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ticagrelor and its metabolites were present in rat milk at higher concentrations than in maternal plasma. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with BRILINTA.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of BRILINTA in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">About half of the patients in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS, and THALES were ≥65 years of age and at least 15% were ≥75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Avoid use of BRILINTA in patients with severe hepatic impairment. There is limited experience with BRILINTA in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span> <span class="Italics">and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on dialysis</span></span></p><p>Clinical efficacy and safety studies with BRILINTA did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, no clinically significant difference in concentrations of ticagrelor and its metabolite and platelet inhibition are expected compared to those observed in patients with normal renal function <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar efficacy and safety in patients with ESRD on dialysis as were seen in PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is currently no known treatment to reverse the effects of BRILINTA, and ticagrelor is not dialyzable. Treatment of overdose should follow local standard medical practice. Bleeding is the expected pharmacologic effect of overdosing. If bleeding occurs, appropriate supportive measures should be taken.</p><p>Platelet transfusion did not reverse the antiplatelet effect of BRILINTA in healthy volunteers and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding.</p><p>Other effects of overdose may include gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) or ventricular pauses. Monitor the ECG.</p><h2>Brilinta Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">BRILINTA contains ticagrelor, a cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine, inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation mediated by the P2Y<span class="Sub">12</span> ADP-receptor.

Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 μM ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist.</p><p>The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours.</p><p>The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 μM ADP.</p><p>As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 5 - Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (±SE) following single oral doses of placebo, 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 6 - Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) following 6 weeks on placebo, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or clopidogrel 75 mg daily</span></p><p>Transitioning from clopidogrel to BRILINTA resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from BRILINTA to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to BRILINTA without interruption of antiplatelet effect <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>BRILINTA can be taken with or without food. Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median t<span class="Sub">max</span> of 1.5 h (range 1.0–4.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median t<span class="Sub">max</span> of 2.5 h (range 1.5-5.0).</p><p>The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36% (range 30%-42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor C<span class="Sub">max</span>, but resulted in a 21% increase in AUC. The C<span class="Sub">max</span> of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC.</p><p>BRILINTA as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> within 80-125% for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX) with a median t<span class="Sub">max</span> of 1.0 hour (range 1.0 – 4.0) for ticagrelor and 2.0 hours (range 1.0 –8.0) for AR-C124910XX.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (&gt;99%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30-40% of the exposure of ticagrelor.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis</span></span></p><p>In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of BRILINTA 90 mg administered on a day without dialysis were 38% and 51% higher respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. A similar increase in exposure was observed when BRILINTA was administered immediately prior to dialysis showing that BRILINTA is not dialyzable. Exposure of the active metabolite increased to a lesser extent. The IPA effect of BRILINTA was independent of dialysis in patients with end stage renal disease and similar to healthy adults with normal renal function.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 7 - Impact of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Effects of Other Drugs on BRILINTA</span></p><p>CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 8 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g., diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure.</p><p>Co-administration of 5 mg intravenous morphine with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor decreased observed mean ticagrelor exposure by up to 25% in healthy adults and up to 36% in ACS patients undergoing PCI. T<span class="Sub">max</span> was delayed by 1-2 hours. Exposure of the active metabolite decreased to a similar extent. Morphine co-administration did not delay or decrease platelet inhibition in healthy adults. Mean platelet aggregation was higher up to 3 hours post loading dose in ACS patients co-administered with morphine.</p><p>Co-administration of intravenous fentanyl with 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor in ACS patients undergoing PCI resulted in similar effects on ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 8 - Effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor</span></p><p>*<span class="Italics">See Dosage and Administration (2)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Effects of BRILINTA on Other Drugs</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter.

The study’s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke.</p><p>Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent.</p><p>All patients randomized to BRILINTA received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75-100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months.</p><p>PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were &gt;65 years and 15% were &gt;75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO.</p><p>Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint.

The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant (<span class="Italics">p</span>=0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings.

About 8% of non-US investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In the US, 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored BRILINTA when used with low maintenance doses (≤100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere.

It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI.</p><p>Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg.

Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk.</p><p>BRILINTA was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span><br/>

The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints.</p><p>Patients were eligible to participate if they were ≥40 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score ≤5) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD2 score ≥6 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis ≥50% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible.</p><p>Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either BRILINTA (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300-325 mg then 75-100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days.</p><p>BRILINTA was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span><br/>
