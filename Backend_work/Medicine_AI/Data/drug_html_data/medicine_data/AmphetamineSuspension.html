</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CNS stimulants, including Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension, other amphetamine-containing products, and methylphenidate, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2</span></span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">9.3)</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">]</span>.</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Amphetamine Suspension</h2><p class="First">Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension is indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in patients 6 years and older <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span> .</p><h2>Amphetamine Suspension Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Pre-Treatment Screening</h3><p class="First">Prior to treating patients with Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension, assess for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span> .</p><p>Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy. Maintain careful prescription records, educate patients about abuse, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and periodically re-evaluate the need for Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]</span> .</p><h3>Dosing Considerations for All Patients</h3><p class="First">Administer Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension orally once daily in the morning with or without food. The dose should be individualized according to the therapeutic needs and response of the patient.</p><p>Shake the bottle of Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension before administering the dose. Do not add Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension to food or mix Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension with other liquids before consuming.</p><h3>Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dose for patients 6 to 17 years of age is 6.3 mg (5 mL) once daily in the morning. Increase in increments of 3.1 mg (2.5 mL) or 6.3 mg (5 mL) at weekly intervals. The maximum dose is 18.8 mg (15 mL) daily for patients 6 to 12 years, and 12.5 mg (10 mL) daily for patients 13 to 17 years.</p><h3>Adults</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension for adults is 12.5 mg (10 mL) daily.</p><h3>Switching from Other Amphetamine Products</h3><p class="First">Patients taking ADDERALL XR may be switched to Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension at the equivalent dose taken once daily <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]</span> . Refer to Table 1 for equivalent doses of Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension and ADDERALL XR. ADDERALL XR (dextroamphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules) is also referred to as mixed salts of a single-entity amphetamine product extended-release capsules (MAS ER).</p><p>If switching from any other amphetamine products, discontinue that treatment, and titrate with Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension using the titration schedule <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)]</span> .</p><p>Do not substitute for other amphetamine products on a milligram-per-milligram basis because of different amphetamine salt compositions and differing pharmacokinetic profiles <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span> .</p><h3>Dosage Modifications Due to Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Agents that alter urinary pH can impact urinary excretion and alter blood levels of amphetamine. Acidifying agents (e.g., ascorbic acid) decrease blood levels, while alkalinizing agents (e.g., sodium bicarbonate) increase blood levels. Adjust Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension dosage accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span> .</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Extended-release oral suspension contains 1.25 mg amphetamine per mL.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension is contraindicated:</p><ul>
<li>In patients known to be hypersensitive to amphetamine, or other components of Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension. Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients treated with other amphetamine products <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span> .</li>
<li>In patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within 14 days of stopping MAOIs (including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue), because of an increased risk of hypertensive crisis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span> .</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Potential for Abuse or Dependence</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants, including Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension, other amphetamine-containing products, and methylphenidate, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Serious Cardiovascular Reactions</h3><p class="First">Sudden death, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults with CNS stimulant treatment at recommended doses. Sudden death has been reported in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, and other serious heart problems. Further evaluate patients who develop exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or arrhythmias during Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension treatment.</p><h3>Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase about 2-4 mm Hg) and heart rate (mean increase about 3-6 bpm). Monitor all patients for potential tachycardia and hypertension.</p><h3>Psychiatric Adverse Events</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Exacerbation of Pre-Existing Psychosis<br/></span> CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Illness<br/></span> CNS stimulants may induce a mixed or manic episode in patients with bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or has a history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms<br/></span> CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without prior history of psychotic illness or mania. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% in placebo-treated patients.</p><h3>Long-Term Suppression of Growth</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants, including Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension.</p><p>Patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted <span class="Italics">[ Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span> .</p><h3>Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's Phenomenon</h3><p class="First">Stimulants, including Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span> . The co-administration with cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitors may also increase the risk with increased exposure to Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension. In these situations, consider an alternative non-serotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span> .</p><p>Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).</p><p>Concomitant use of Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension with MAOI drugs is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span> .</p><p>Discontinue treatment with Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors is clinically warranted, initiate Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension with lower doses, monitor patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome during drug initiation or titration, and inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome.</p><h3>Potential for Overdose Due to Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension and other amphetamine products could occur, leading to possible overdosage. To avoid substitution errors and overdosage, do not substitute for other amphetamine products on a milligram-per-milligram basis because of different amphetamine salt compositions and differing pharmacokinetic profiles <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span> .</p><h3>Potential for Intestinal Necrosis</h3><p class="First">Cases of intestinal necrosis, including some deaths, have been reported with the concomitant use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol, two of the inactive ingredients in Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension. In these cases, patients were administered sodium polystyrene sulfonate to treat hyperkalemia at doses greater than 200 times the amount present in Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension. However, no absolute safe levels for the interaction of sodium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol have been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The safety of Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension has been established from adequate and well-controlled studies of single-entity amphetamine product extended-release (MAS ER) capsules <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span> . The adverse reactions of MAS ER capsules in these adequate and well-controlled studies are described below.</p><p>The premarketing development program for MAS ER included exposures in a total of 1315 participants in clinical trials (635 pediatric patients, 350 adolescent patients, 248 adult patients, and 82 healthy adult subjects). Of these, 635 patients (ages 6 to 12) were evaluated in two controlled clinical studies, one open-label clinical study, and two single-dose clinical pharmacology studies (N= 40).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment<br/></span> The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of MAS ER in controlled and uncontrolled, multiple-dose clinical trials of pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years (N=595) were anorexia (loss of appetite) (2.9%), insomnia (1.5%), weight loss (1.2%), emotional lability (1%), and depression (0.7%).</p><p>In a separate placebo-controlled 4-week study in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years with ADHD, five patients (2.1%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events among MAS ER-treated patients (N=233) compared to none who received placebo (N=54). The most frequent adverse event leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e. leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of MAS ER-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) was insomnia (1.3%, n=3).</p><p>In one placebo-controlled 4-week study among adults with ADHD with doses 20 mg to 60 mg, 23 patients (12.0%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events among MAS ER-treated patients (N=191) compared to one patient (1.6%) who received placebo (N=64). The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e. leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of MAS ER-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were insomnia (5.2%, n=10), anxiety (2.1%, n=4), nervousness (1.6%, n=3), dry mouth (1.6%, n=3), anorexia (1.6%, n=3), tachycardia (1.6%, n=3), headache (1.6%, n=3), and asthenia (1.0%, n=2).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Occurring in Controlled Trials</span></p><p>Adverse reactions reported in a 3-week clinical trial of pediatric patients 6 to 12 years and a 4-week clinical trial in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age and adults, respectively, treated with MAS ER or placebo are presented in the tables below.</p><p>* Included doses up to 40 mg<br/>
<span class="Sup">b</span> Dose-related adverse reactions<br/>
Note: The following reactions did not meet the criterion for inclusion in Table 3 but were reported by 2% to 4% of adolescent patients receiving MAS ER with a higher incidence than patients receiving placebo in this study: accidental injury, asthenia (fatigue), dry mouth, dyspepsia, emotional lability, nausea, somnolence, and vomiting.</p><p>*Included doses up to 60 mg.<br/>
<br/>
Note: The following reactions did not meet the criterion for inclusion in Table 4 but were reported by 2% to 4% of adult patients receiving MAS ER with a higher incidence than patients receiving placebo in this study: infection, photosensitivity reaction, constipation, tooth disorder (e.g. teeth clenching, tooth infection), emotional lability, libido decreased, somnolence, speech disorder (e.g., stuttering, excessive speech), palpitation, twitching, dyspnea, sweating, dysmenorrhea, and impotence.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials and Spontaneous Postmarketing Reports of Other Amphetamine Products</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are from clinical trials and spontaneous postmarketing reports of other amphetamine products in pediatric patients and adults with ADHD. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Cardiovascular: Palpitations, sudden death, myocardial infarction. There have been isolated reports of cardiomyopathy associated with chronic amphetamine use.</p><p>Central Nervous System: Restlessness, irritability, euphoria, dyskinesia, dysphoria, depression, tremor, aggression, anger, logorrhea, and paresthesia (including formication).</p><p>Eye Disorders: Vision blurred, mydriasis.</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Unpleasant taste, constipation, other gastrointestinal disturbances.</p><p>Allergic: Urticaria, rash, hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema and anaphylaxis. Serious skin rashes, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported.</p><p>Endocrine: Impotence, change in libido, frequent or prolonged erections.</p><p>Skin: Alopecia.</p><p>Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders: Rhabdomyolysis.</p><p>Psychiatric Disorders: Dermatillomania, bruxism.</p><p>Vascular Disorders: Raynaud's phenomenon</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with Amphetamines</h3><p class="First">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, St. John's Wort</p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">Amphetamines can cause a significant elevation in plasma corticosteroid levels. This increase is greatest in the evening. Amphetamines may interfere with urinary steroid determinations.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Exposure Registry<br/></span> There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychostimulants at 1-866-961-2388.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary<br/></span> The limited available data from published literature and postmarketing reports on the use of prescription amphetamine in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major congenital malformations or miscarriage. Adverse pregnancy outcomes, including premature delivery and low birth weight, have been seen in infants born to mothers dependent on amphetamines <span class="Italics">( <span class="Italics">see Clinical Considerations</span>).</span></p><p>No effects on morphological development were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of amphetamine to rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 4 and 20 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 12.5 mg/day (as base) given to adolescents, on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis. However, in a pre- and post-natal development study, amphetamine ( <span class="Italics">d</span>- to <span class="Italics">l</span>- ratio of 3:1) administered orally to pregnant rats during gestation and lactation caused a decrease in pup survival and a decrease in pup body weight that correlated with a delay in developmental landmarks at clinically relevant doses of amphetamine. In addition, adverse effects on reproductive performance were observed in pups whose mothers were treated with amphetamine. Long-term neurochemical and behavioral effects have also been reported in published animal developmental studies using clinically relevant doses of amphetamine ( <span class="Italics">see Data</span>).</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions<br/></span> Amphetamines, such as Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension, cause vasoconstriction and thereby may decrease placental perfusion. In addition, amphetamines can stimulate uterine contractions increasing the risk of premature delivery. Infants born to amphetamine dependent mothers have an increased risk of premature delivery and low birth weight.</p><p>Monitor infants born to mothers taking amphetamines for symptoms of withdrawal, such as feeding difficulties, irritability, agitation, and excessive drowsiness.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Animal Data<br/></span> Amphetamine ( <span class="Italics">d</span>- to <span class="Italics">l</span>- enantiomer ratio of 3:1) had no apparent effects on embryofetal morphological development or survival when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis at doses of up to 6 and 16 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are approximately 4 and 20 times, respectively, the MRHD of 12.5 mg/day (as base) given to adolescents, on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Fetal malformations and death have been reported in mice following parenteral administration of <span class="Italics">d</span>-amphetamine doses of 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 15 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis) or greater to pregnant animals. Administration of these doses was also associated with severe maternal toxicity.</p><p>A study was conducted in which pregnant rats received daily oral doses of amphetamine ( <span class="Italics">d</span>- to <span class="Italics">l</span>- enantiomer ratio of 3:1) of 2, 6, and 10 mg/kg from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20. These doses are approximately 1, 4, and 6 times the MRHD of 12.5 mg/day (as base) given to adolescents, on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis. All doses caused hyperactivity and decreased weight gain in the dams. A decrease in pup survival was seen at all doses. A decrease in pup body weight was seen at 6 and 10 mg/kg which correlated with delays in developmental landmarks, such as preputial separation and vaginal opening. Increased pup locomotor activity was seen at 10 mg/kg on day 22 postpartum but not at 5 weeks postweaning. When pups were tested for reproductive performance at maturation, gestational weight gain, number of implantations, and number of delivered pups were decreased in the group whose mothers had been given 10 mg/kg.</p><p>A number of studies in rodents indicate that prenatal or early postnatal exposure to amphetamine ( <span class="Italics">d</span>- or <span class="Italics">d</span>, <span class="Italics">l</span>-), at doses similar to those used clinically, can result in long-term neurochemical and behavioral alterations. Reported behavioral effects include learning and memory deficits, altered locomotor activity, and changes in sexual function.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary<br/></span> Based on limited case reports in published literature, amphetamine ( <span class="Italics">d</span>- or <span class="Italics">d</span>, <span class="Italics">l</span>-) is present in human milk, at relative infant doses of 2% to 13.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 1.9 and 7.5. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant. Long term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from stimulant exposure are unknown. It is possible that large dosages of amphetamine might interfere with milk production, especially in women whose lactation is not well established. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness have been established in pediatric patients with ADHD ages 6 to 17 years of age in three adequate and well-controlled clinical trials of up to 4 weeks in duration <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12), Clinical Studies (14)]</span> . Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age with ADHD have not been established.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Long-Term Growth Suppression<br/></span> Growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, including Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension, and children who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span> .</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data<br/></span> Juvenile rats treated with mixed amphetamine salts early in the postnatal period through sexual maturation demonstrated transient changes in motor activity. Learning and memory was impaired at approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis. No recovery was seen following a drug free period. A delay in sexual maturation was observed at a dose approximately 10 times the MRHD given to pediatric patients on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis, although there was no effect on fertility.</p><p>In a juvenile developmental study, rats received daily oral doses of amphetamine ( <span class="Italics">d</span> to <span class="Italics">l</span> enantiomer ratio of 3:1) of 2, 6, or 20 mg/kg on days 7-13 of age; from day 14 to approximately day 60 of age these doses were given twice daily for total daily doses of 4, 12, or 40 mg/kg. The latter doses are approximately 1, 3, and 10 times the MRHD of 18.8 mg/day (as base) given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Post-dosing hyperactivity was seen at all doses; motor activity measured prior to the daily dose was decreased during the dosing period but the decreased motor activity was largely absent after an 18 day drug-free recovery period. Performance in the Morris water maze test for learning and memory was impaired at the 40 mg/kg dose, and sporadically at the lower doses, when measured prior to the daily dose during the treatment period; no recovery was seen after a 19 day drug-free period. A delay in the developmental milestones of vaginal opening and preputial separation was seen at 40 mg/kg but there was no effect on fertility.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension contains amphetamine, a Schedule II controlled substance in the U.S. Controlled Substances Act (CSA).</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension, is a CNS stimulant that contains amphetamine which has a high potential for abuse. Abuse is characterized by impaired control of drug use, compulsive use despite harm, and craving.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of amphetamine abuse may include increased heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and/or sweating, dilated pupils, hyperactivity, restlessness, insomnia, decreased appetite, loss of coordination, tremors, flushed skin, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed. Abusers of amphetamines may use other unapproved routes of administration which can result in overdose and death <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span> .</p><p>To reduce the abuse of Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, keep careful prescription records, educate patients and their families about abuse and proper storage and disposal of CNS stimulants, monitor for signs of abuse while on therapy, and re-evaluate the need for Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension use.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Tolerance<br/></span> Tolerance (a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug results in a reduction of the drug's desired and/or undesired effects over time) may occur during the chronic therapy of CNS stimulants including Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Dependence<br/></span> Physical dependence (which is manifested by a withdrawal syndrome produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, or administration of an antagonist) may occur in patients treated with CNS stimulants including Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension. Withdrawal symptoms after abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration of CNS stimulants include dysphoric mood; fatigue; vivid, unpleasant dreams; insomnia or hypersomnia; increased appetite; and psychomotor retardation or agitation.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Consult with a Certified Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) for up-to-date guidance and advice for treatment of overdosage. Individual patient response to amphetamines varies widely. Toxic symptoms may occur idiosyncratically at low doses.</p><p>Manifestations of amphetamine overdose include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, panic states, hyperpyrexia and rhabdomyolysis. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central nervous system stimulation.

This change is not considered clinically significant. The mean time to peak concentration (Tmax) for <span class="Italics">d</span>- and <span class="Italics">l</span>- amphetamine was about 5 hours after administration of Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension with or without food.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Effect of Alcohol<br/></span> In an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> alcohol-induced dose dumping study, a substantial increase in amphetamine release occurred in the presence of 40% alcohol but not with 5%, 10% and 20% alcohol.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Excretion<br/></span> Amphetamine is reported to be oxidized at the 4 position of the benzene ring to form 4-hydroxyamphetamine, or on the side chain α or β carbons to form alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine or norephedrine, respectively. Norephedrine and 4-hydroxy-amphetamine are both active and each is subsequently oxidized to form 4-hydroxy-norephedrine. Alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine undergoes deamination to form phenylacetone, which ultimately forms benzoic acid and its glucuronide and the glycine conjugate hippuric acid. Although the enzymes involved in amphetamine metabolism have not been clearly defined, CYP2D6 is known to be involved with formation of 4-hydroxy-amphetamine. Since CYP2D6 is genetically polymorphic, population variations in amphetamine metabolism are a possibility.</p><p>Amphetamine is known to inhibit monoamine oxidase, whereas the ability of amphetamine and its metabolites to inhibit various P450 isozymes and other enzymes has not been adequately elucidated. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> experiments with human microsomes indicate minor inhibition of CYP2D6 by amphetamine and minor inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, and 3A4 by one or more metabolites. However, due to the probability of auto-inhibition and the lack of information on the concentration of these metabolites relative to <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> concentrations, no predications regarding the potential for amphetamine or its metabolites to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs by CYP isozymes <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> can be made.</p><p>With normal urine pHs, approximately half of an administered dose of amphetamine is recoverable in urine as derivatives of alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine and approximately another 30-40% of the dose is recoverable in urine as amphetamine itself. Since amphetamine has a pKa of 9.9, urinary recovery of amphetamine is highly dependent on pH and urine flow rates. Alkaline urine pHs result in less ionization and reduced renal elimination, and acidic pHs and high flow rates result in increased renal elimination with clearances greater than glomerular filtration rates, indicating the involvement of active secretion. Urinary recovery of amphetamine has been reported to range from 1% to 75%, depending on urinary pH, with the remaining fraction of the dose hepatically metabolized. Consequently, both hepatic and renal dysfunction have the potential to inhibit the elimination of amphetamine and result in prolonged exposures. In addition, drugs that effect urinary pH are known to alter the elimination of amphetamine, and any decrease in amphetamine's metabolism that might occur due to drug interactions or genetic polymorphisms is more likely to be clinically significant when renal elimination is decreased <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span> .</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations<br/></span> Comparison of the pharmacokinetics of <span class="Italics">d</span>- and <span class="Italics">l</span>-amphetamine after oral administration of MAS ER in children (6-12 years) and adolescent (13-17 years) ADHD patients and healthy adult volunteers indicates that body weight is the primary determinant of apparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of <span class="Italics">d</span>-and <span class="Italics">l</span>-amphetamine across the age range. Systemic exposure measured by area under the curve to infinity (AUC <span class="Sub">∞</span>) and maximum plasma concentration (C <span class="Sub">max</span>) decreased with increases in body weight, while oral volume of distribution (V <span class="Sub">Z</span>/F), oral clearance (CL/F), and elimination half-life (t <span class="Sub">1/2</span>) increased with increases in body weight.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients<br/></span> The pharmacokinetics of <span class="Italics">d</span>- and <span class="Italics">l</span>-amphetamine in pediatric patients has been evaluated based on the pharmacokinetics after administration of MAS ER to pediatric patients. On a mg/kg weight basis, pediatric patients eliminate amphetamine faster than adults. The elimination half-life (t <span class="Sub">1/2</span>) is approximately 1 hour shorter for <span class="Italics">d</span>-amphetamine and 2 hours shorter for <span class="Italics">l-</span>amphetamine in pediatric patients than in adults. However, for a given dose of MAS ER, pediatric patients had higher systemic exposure to amphetamine (C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC) than adults which was attributed to the higher dose administered to pediatric patients on a mg/kg body weight basis compared to adults. Upon dose normalization on a mg/kg basis, pediatric patients showed 30% less systemic exposure compared to adults.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of <span class="Italics">d</span>- and <span class="Italics">l</span>-amphetamine after administration of Amphetamine extended-release oral suspension was evaluated in a single dose pharmacokinetic study in 29 pediatric patients 6 - 12 years with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
