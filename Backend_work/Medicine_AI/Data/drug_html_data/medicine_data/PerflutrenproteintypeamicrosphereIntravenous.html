Ultrasound contrast agents are used to help provide a clear picture during ultrasound. Ultrasound is a special kind of diagnostic procedure. It uses high-frequency sound waves to create images or “pictures” of certain areas inside the body. The sound waves produced by the ultrasound equipment can be reflected (bounced off) by different parts of the body, such as, the heart. As the sound waves return they are electronically converted into images on a television screen. Unlike x-rays, ultrasound does not involve ionizing radiation. The albumin microspheres sonicated preparation contains very small gas-filled albumin microspheres that reflect the sound waves and help create a better picture.</p><p>Perflutren protein type a microsphere is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor with specialized training in ultrasound procedures.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using perflutren protein type a microsphere</h2><p>In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do.
