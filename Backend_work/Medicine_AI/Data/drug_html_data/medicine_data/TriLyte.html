</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for TriLyte</h2><p class="First">TriLyte is indicated for bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopy in adults and pediatric patients aged 6 months or greater.</p><h2>TriLyte Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage Overview</h3><p class="First">TriLyte, supplied as a powder, must be reconstituted with water before its use; it is not for direct ingestion <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].</span> The 4 liter reconstituted TriLyte solution contains: 420 grams of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 5.72 grams of sodium bicarbonate, 11.2 grams of sodium chloride, and 1.4 grams of potassium chloride. TriLyte may be used with or without one of the supplied flavor packs.</p><h3>Administration Instructions Prior to Dosage</h3><p class="First">On the day prior to the colonoscopy, instruct patients to:</p><h3>Dosage</h3><p class="First">The following is the recommended dose of reconstituted TriLyte solution for adults and pediatric patients ≥ 6 months. Instruct patients they may consume water or clear liquids during the bowel preparation and after completion of the bowel preparation up until 2 hours before the time of the colonoscopy. The solution is more palatable if chilled prior to administration.</p><p>The first bowel movements should occur approximately one hour after the start of TriLyte administration. Continue drinking until the watery stool is clear and free of solid matter.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">For oral solution: One 4 liter jug with powder for reconstitution with water.</p><p>Each 4 liter jug contains: polyethylene glycol 3350 420 g, sodium bicarbonate 5.72 g, sodium chloride 11.2 g, potassium chloride 1.48 g and flavoring ingredients 3.22 g. When made up to 4 liters volume with water, the solution contains PEG 3350 31.3 mmol/L, sodium 65 mmol/L, chloride 53 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17 mmol/L and potassium 5 mmol/L.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">TriLyte is contraindicated in the following conditions:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of TriLyte. Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure when replacing fluids. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration including signs of orthostatic hypotension after taking TriLyte, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) and treat accordingly. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment. Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected before treatment with TriLyte.</p><p>In addition, use caution when prescribing TriLyte for patients who have conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.1)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>Cardiac Arrhythmias</h3><p class="First">There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing TriLyte for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.</p><p>Use caution when prescribing TriLyte for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Use caution when prescribing TriLyte for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration, and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients.</p><h3>Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis</h3><p class="First">Administration of osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and TriLyte may increase this risk. The potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation should be considered when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p><h3>Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease</h3><p class="First">If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering TriLyte. If a patient experiences severe bloating, distention or abdominal pain, administration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until the symptoms abate. If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, appropriate studies should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of TriLyte.</p><p>Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.</p><h3>Aspiration</h3><p class="First">Use with caution in patients with impaired gag reflex, unconscious, or semiconscious patients, and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration. Such patients should be observed during administration of TriLyte, especially if it administered via nasogastric tube.</p><h3>Not for Direct Ingestion</h3><p class="First">The contents of each jug must be diluted with water to a final volume of 4 liters (4 L) and ingestion of additional water is important to patient tolerance. Direct ingestion of the undissolved powder may increase the risk of nausea, vomiting, dehydration, and electrolyte disturbances.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of TriLyte. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Nausea, abdominal fullness and bloating are the most common adverse reactions (occurred in up to 50% of patients) to administration of TriLyte. Abdominal cramps, vomiting and anal irritation occur less frequently. These adverse reactions are transient and usually subside rapidly. Isolated cases of urticaria, rhinorrhea, dermatitis and (rarely) anaphylactic reaction have been reported which may represent allergic reactions.</p><p>Published literature contains isolated reports of serious adverse reactions following the administration of PEG-electrolyte solution products in patients over 60 years of age. These adverse events include upper GI bleeding from Mallory-Weiss Tear, esophageal perforation, asystole, sudden dyspnea with pulmonary edema, and “butterfly-like” infiltrates on chest X-ray after vomiting and aspirating PEG.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drugs that May Lead to Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Use caution when prescribing TriLyte for patients who are using medications that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and prolonged QT in the setting of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Consider additional patient evaluations as appropriate <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4)]</span> in patients taking these concomitant medications.</p><h3>Potential for Altered Drug Absorption</h3><p class="First">Oral medication administered within one hour of the start of administration of TriLyte may be flushed from the gastrointestinal tract and the medication may not be absorbed properly.</p><h3>Stimulant Laxatives</h3><p class="First">Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and TriLyte may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis. Avoid use of stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate) while taking TriLyte.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with TriLyte. It is also not known whether TriLyte can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. TriLyte should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when TriLyte is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of TriLyte in pediatric patients aged 6 months and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials of TriLyte in adults with additional safety and efficacy data from published studies of similar formulations.</p><p>Use of TriLyte in children younger than 2 years of age should be carefully monitored for occurrence of possible hypoglycemia, as this solution has no caloric substrate. Dehydration has been reported in one child and hypokalemia has been reported in 3 children.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of TriLyte did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>TriLyte Description</h2><p class="First">For oral solution: Each 4 liter (4 L) TriLyte jug contains a white to off white powder for reconstitution. TriLyte is a combination of polyethylene glycol 3350, an osmotic laxative, and electrolytes (sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride) for oral solution.</p><p>Each 4 liter jug contains: polyethylene glycol 3350 420 g, sodium bicarbonate 5.72 g, sodium chloride 11.2 g, potassium chloride 1.48 g. The solution is clear and colorless when reconstituted to a final volume of 4 liters with water.</p><p>Polyethylene Glycol 3350, USP</p><p>Sodium Bicarbonate, USP</p><p>The chemical name is NaHCO<span class="Sub">3</span>.
