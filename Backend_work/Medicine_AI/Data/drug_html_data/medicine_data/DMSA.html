</ul><h2>DMSA Description</h2><p class="First">AnazaoHealth supplies DMSA as a compounded kit for preparing Tc 99m DMSA. Each Reaction vial contains 1.1 mg meso-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, 0.2 mg tin as stannous chloride, and 0.7 mg ascorbic acid. The vial is back filled with inert gas and may contain a partial vacuum.</p><p>Each Acetate buffer vial contains 1.2 ml Sodium Acetate .25 N. pH 5.2 to 5.6.</p><p>LDO normal saline included for dilution of prepared kit, if required</p><h2>DMSA - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Technetium Tc 99m DMSA, when administered intravenously apparently binds to plasma proteins in the blood and collects in the renal cortex.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for DMSA</h2><p class="First">Technetium Tc 99m DMSA by intravenous administration is indicated as a static kidney imaging agent.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">There are no known contraindications.</p><h2>DMSA Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Preparation of Technetium Tc 99m DMSA is done by the following aseptic procedure:</p><p>Tagging Tips</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>If you need only a one or two mCi dose for your patient, use about 10 mCi of Tc 99m for your kit. Do not stretch your kit to 40 mCi if you do not need to. We have tested the kits to 40 mCi with a Friday generator eluted on Monday but recommend using only what you need</li>
<li>Keep your volumes low. Take your Tc 99m and dilute to about 1cc with the Low Dissolved Oxygen saline and inject into the DMSA kit</li>
<li>Let the kit stand for about 15 minutes with just the Tc 99m and DMSA (NO BUFFER)</li>
<li>After 15 minutes, then add the buffer. This is only for patient comfort and will interfere with the tagging process if introduced any earlier</li>
<li>After buffering you can add additional “Low Dissolved Oxygen” saline to dilute the kit</li>
<li>You should inject the dose within 2 hours after making the kit for best results</li>
</ul><h3>Storage and Handling</h3><p class="First">Store the kit at 2°-8°C (36°-46°F) and protect from light</p><h2>PACKAGE LABEL.PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Figure 1</span></p><h2>More about DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid)</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
