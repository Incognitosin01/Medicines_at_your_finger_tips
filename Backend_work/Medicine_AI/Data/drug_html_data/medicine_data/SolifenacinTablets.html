</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening.</p><p>Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span> . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue Solifenacin Succinate Tablets andprovide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway.</p><h3>Urinary Retention</h3><p class="First">The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span> .</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Disorders</h3><p class="First">The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastric retention <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span> . The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility.</p><h3>Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span> A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Solifenacin Succinate Tablets affect them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation.</p><h3>Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma</h3><p class="First">Solifenacin Succinate Tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span> , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adultpatients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QTprolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect ofsolifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose.</p><p>The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="CM32 First"></p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span> . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group.</p><p>In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span> .</p><p>The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks. </p><p class="First">Number of Patients</p><p class="First">1216</p><p class="First">578</p><p class="First">1233</p><p class="First">GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS</p><p class="First">     Dry Mouth</p><p class="First">4.2</p><p class="First">10.9</p><p class="First">27.6</p><p class="First">     Constipation</p><p class="First">2.9</p><p class="First">5.4</p><p class="First">13.4</p><p class="First">     Nausea</p><p class="First">2.0</p><p class="First">1.7</p><p class="First">3.3</p><p class="First">     Dyspepsia</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">3.9</p><p class="First">     Abdominal Pain Upper</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">1.9</p><p class="First">1.2</p><p class="First">     Vomiting NOS</p><p class="First">0.9</p><p class="First">0.2</p><p class="First">1.1</p><p class="First">INFECTIONS AND INFESTATIONS</p><p class="First">     Urinary Tract Infection NOS</p><p class="First">2.8</p><p class="First">2.8</p><p class="First">4.8</p><p class="First">     Influenza</p><p class="First">1.3</p><p class="First">2.2</p><p class="First">0.9</p><p class="First">     Pharyngitis NOS</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">1.1</p><p class="First">NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS</p><p class="First">     Dizziness</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">1.9</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">EYE DISORDERS</p><p class="First">     Vision Blurred</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">3.8</p><p class="First">4.8</p><p class="First">     Dry Eyes NOS</p><p class="First">0.6</p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">1.6</p><p class="First">RENAL AND URINARY DISORDERS</p><p class="First">     Urinary Retention</p><p class="First">0.6</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS</p><p class="First">     Edema Lower Limb</p><p class="First">0.7</p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">1.1</p><p class="First">     Fatigue</p><p class="First">1.1</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">2.1</p><p class="First">PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS</p><p class="First">     Depression NOS</p><p class="First">0.8</p><p class="First">1.2</p><p class="First">0.8</p><p class="First">RESPIRATORY, THORACIC AND MEDIASTINAL DISORDERS</p><p class="First">    Cough</p><p class="First">0.2</p><p class="First">0.2</p><p class="First">1.1</p><p class="First">VASCULAR DISORDERS</p><p class="First">    Hypertension NOS</p><p class="First">0.6</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">0.5</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of solifenacin succinate in the U.S. and/or outside of the U.S. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold">General disorders and administration site conditions</span>: peripheral edema, hypersensitivity reactions (including angioedema with airway obstruction, rash, pruritus, urticaria, anaphylactic reaction);</p><p><span class="Bold">Nervous system disorders</span>: dizziness, headache, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, somnolence;</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac disorders</span>: QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, palpitations;</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatobiliary disorders</span> : liver disorders mostly characterized by abnormal liver function tests, AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase);</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal and urinary disorders</span>: renal impairment, urinary retention;</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and nutrition disorders</span>: decreased appetite, hyperkalemia;</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders</span>: exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, dry skin;</p><p><span class="Bold">Eye disorders</span>: glaucoma;</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal disorders</span>: gastroesophageal reflux disease, ileus, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysgeusia, sialadenitis;</p><p><span class="Bold">Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders</span>: dysphonia, nasal dryness;</p><p><span class="Bold">Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders</span>: muscular weakness.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="Default First">Solifenacin is a substrate of CYP3A4. Concomitant use of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, significantly increased the exposure of solifenacin <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> . The dosage of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets greater than 5 mg once daily is not recommended when concomitantly used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration</span><span class="Italics">(2.4)]</span> .</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no studies with the use of solifenacin succinate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with oral administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis at a dose resulting in 1.2 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day. However, administration of doses 3.6 times and greater than the MRHD during organogenesis produced maternal toxicity in the pregnant mice and resulted in developmental toxicity and reduced fetal body weights in offspring <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p class="CM33">Oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice resulted in the recovery of radiolabel in the fetus indicating that solifenacin-related product can cross the placental barrier. In pregnant mice, administration of solifenacin succinate at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day (7.9 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg), resulted in an increased incidence of cleft palate and increased maternal lethality. Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant mice during organogenesis at greater than or equal to 3.6 times (100 mg/kg/day and greater) the systemic exposure at the MRHD, resulted in reduced fetal body weights and reduced maternal body weight gain. No embryo-fetal toxicity or teratogenicity was observed in fetuses from pregnant mice treated with solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD). Administration of solifenacin succinate to pregnant rats and rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (&lt; 1 times and 1.8 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD, respectively), resulted in no findings of embryo-fetal toxicity. Oral pre- and post-natal administration of solifenacin succinate at 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis through weaning, resulted in reduced peripartum and postnatal survival, reduced body weight gain by the pups, and delayed physical development (eye opening and vaginal patency). An increase in the percentage of male offspring was also observed in litters from offspring (F2 generation) exposed to maternal doses of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on natural delivery in mice treated with 1.2 times (30 mg/kg/day) the expected systemic exposure at the MRHD.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information on the presence of solifenacin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Solifenacin is present in mouse milk <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for solifenacin succinate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from solifenacin succinate or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p class="CM33">Oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-solifenacin succinate to lactating mice resulted in the recovery of radioactivity in maternal milk. Lactating female mice orally administered solifenacin succinate at a maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day (3.6 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had increased postpartum pup mortality, pups with reduced body weights, or delays in the onset of reflex and physical development. Pups from lactating dams orally administered solifenacin succinate at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the systemic exposure at the MRHD) had no discernible adverse findings. The concentrations of solifenacin in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have not been established in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="CM33 First">In placebo-controlled clinical studies, similar safety and effectiveness were observed between geriatric patients (623 patients ≥ 65 years and 189 patients ≥ 75 years) and younger adult patients (1188 patients &lt; 65 years) treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="CM33 First">Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in patients with severe renal impairment (CL <span class="Sub">cr</span> &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span>) is 5 mg once daily <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span> . The recommended dose in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as in patients with normal renal function.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="CM33 First">Solifenacin plasma concentrations are greater in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> . Because increased solifenacin plasma concentrations increase the risk of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, the maximum recommended dose of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 5 mg once daily <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span> and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).</p><h3>Gender</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of solifenacin is not significantly influenced by gender.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdosage with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets can potentially result in severe antimuscarinic effects and should be treated accordingly. The highest dose ingested in an accidental overdose of solifenacin succinate was 280 mg (28 times the maximum dosage) in a 5-hour period. This case was associated with mental status changes. Some cases reported a decrease in the level of consciousness.</p><p>Intolerable antimuscarinic adverse reactions (fixed and dilated pupils, blurred vision, failure of heel-to-toe exam, tremors, and dry skin) occurred on day 3 in normal volunteers taking 50 mg daily (5 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose) and resolved within 7 days following discontinuation of drug.</p><p>In the event of overdose with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, treat with gastric lavage and appropriate supportive measures. ECG monitoring is also recommended. </p><h2>Solifenacin Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Chemically, solifenacin succinate is butanedioic acid, compounded with (1S)-(3R)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl 3,4-dihydro-1-phenyl-2(1H)iso-quinolinecarboxylate (1:1) having an empirical formula of C <span class="Sub">23</span>H <span class="Sub">26</span>N <span class="Sub">2</span>O <span class="Sub">2</span>•C <span class="Sub">4</span>H <span class="Sub">6</span>O <span class="Sub">4</span>, and a molecular weight of 480.55. The structural formula of solifenacin succinate is:</p><p></p><p>Solifenacin succinate is a white to pale-yellowish-white crystal or crystalline powder. It is freely soluble at room temperature in water, glacial acetic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, and methanol. Each Solifenacin Succinate tablet contains 5 or 10 mg of solifenacin succinate and is for oral administration. In addition to the active ingredient solifenacin succinate, each Solifenacin Succinate tablet also contains the following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, pregelatinized starch, hypromellose 2910, magnesium stearate, triacetin, polyethylene glycol 3350 and titanium dioxide with yellow ferric oxide and red ferric oxide.</p><h2>Solifenacin Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>The effect of 10 mg and 30 mg solifenacin succinate (three times the maximum recommended dose) on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak plasma concentration of solifenacin in a multi-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) trial <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].</span> After receiving placebo and moxifloxacin sequentially, subjects were randomized to one of two treatment groups. One group (n=51) completed 3 additional sequential periods of dosing with solifenacin succinate 10, 20, and 30 mg while the second group (n=25) in parallel completed a sequence of placebo and moxifloxacin. Study subjects were female volunteers aged 19 to 79 years. The 30 mg dose of solifenacin succinate (three times the highest recommended dose) was chosen for use in this study because this dose results in a solifenacin exposure that covers those observed upon coadministration of 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 400 mg). Due to the sequential dose escalating nature of the study, baseline ECG measurements were separated from the final QT assessment (of the 30 mg dose level) by 33 days.</p><p>The median difference from baseline in heart rate associated with the 10 and 30 mg doses of solifenacin succinate compared to placebo was -2 and 0 beats/minute, respectively. Because a significant period effect on QTc was observed, the QTc effects were analyzed utilizing the parallel placebo control arm rather than the pre-specified intra-patient analysis. Representative results are shown in Table 2.</p><p class="First">Solifenacin succinate 10 mg</p><p class="First">2 (-3,6)</p><p class="First">Solifenacin succinate 30 mg</p><p class="First">8 (4,13)</p><p class="First">*Results displayed are those derived from the parallel design portion of the study and represent the comparison of Group 1 to time-matched placebo effects in Group 2.</p><p>Moxifloxacin was included as a positive control in this study and, given the length of the study, its effect on the QT interval was evaluated in 3 different sessions. The placebo-subtracted mean changes (90% CI) in QTcF for moxifloxacin in the three sessions were 11 (7, 14), 12 (8, 17), and 16 (12, 21), respectively.</p><p>The QT interval prolonging effect of the highest solifenacin succinate dose (three times the maximum therapeutic dose) studied was not as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its recommended dose. However, the confidence intervals overlapped, and this study was not designed to draw direct statistical conclusions between the drugs or the dose levels.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>After oral administration of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets in healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations levels (C <span class="Sub">max</span>) of solifenacin were reached within 3 to 8 hours after administration and, at steady-state, ranged from 32.3 to 62.9 ng/mL for the 5 and 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of solifenacin is approximately 90%, with plasma concentrations of solifenacin proportional to the dose administered.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Food</span></p><p>Solifenacin Succinate Tablets may be administered without regard to meals. A single 10 mg dose administration of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with food increased C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of solifenacin by 4% and 3%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Solifenacin is approximately 98% ( <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>) bound to human plasma proteins, principally to α <span class="Sub">1</span>-acid glycoprotein. Solifenacin is highly distributed to non-CNS tissues, having a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 600 L.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>The elimination half-life (t <span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of solifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 45-68 hours.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Solifenacin is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary pathway for elimination is by way of CYP3A4; however, alternate metabolic pathways exist. The primary metabolic routes of solifenacin are through N-oxidation of the quinuclidin ring and 4R-hydroxylation of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. One pharmacologically active metabolite (4R-hydroxy solifenacin), occurring at low concentrations and unlikely to contribute significantly to clinical activity, and three pharmacologically inactive metabolites (N-glucuronide and the N-oxide and 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide of solifenacin) have been found in human plasma after oral dosing.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Following the administration of 10 mg of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-solifenacin succinate to healthy volunteers, 69% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 23% in the feces over 26 days.

No increased frequency in mortality was observed in juvenile mice that were treated after weaning for a duration of 4 weeks, from day 21 after birth onwards. Plasma exposure at postnatal day 10 was higher than in adult mice; the systemic exposure at postnatal day 21 was comparable to the systemic exposure in adult mice.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Solifenacin Succinate Tablets were evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for ≥ 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on Solifenacin Succinate Tablets and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg Solifenacin Succinate Tablets doses (Studies 1 and 2) and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years.</p><p>The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition.</p><p>The efficacy of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg (2.3; p &lt; 0.001) and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg (2.7; p &lt; 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4).The mean reduction in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours was significantly greater with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg (1.5; p &lt; 0.001) and Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg (1.8; p &lt; 0.001) treatment groups compared to the placebo treatment group (1.1).
