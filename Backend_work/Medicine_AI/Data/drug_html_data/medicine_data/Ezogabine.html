<html><head></head><body><h1>Ezogabine (Oral)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> ezogabine (e-ZOG-a-been)</p><p>Retinal abnormalities that can progress to vision loss were seen in about one-third of patients after approximately 4 years of ezogabine treatment. The retinal abnormalities exhibited fundoscopic features similar to those of retinal pigment dystrophies. The reversibility and rate of progression of the retinal abnormalities is unknown. Accordingly, ezogabine is only indicated for patients who have experienced refractory results with other treatments and in whom the benefits of ezogabine exceed the risk of vision loss. Visual monitoring (including visual acuity, dilated fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, and possibly fluorescein angiograms, perimetry, and electroretinograms) is indicated at baseline and 6-month intervals thereafter with ezogabine therapy. Discontinue use if retinal pigmentary abnormalities or vision changes are detected unless no other treatment options are available and in patients who do not gain substantial clinical benefit after adequate ezogabine titration .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for ezogabine</h2><p>Ezogabine is used together with other medicines to control partial seizures (convulsions) in the treatment of epilepsy.</p><p>Ezogabine belongs to a class of medicines called anticonvulsants. It acts in the brain to prevent seizures. However, ezogabine cannot cure epilepsy and will only work to control seizures as long as you continue to take it.</p><p>Ezogabine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using ezogabine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.
