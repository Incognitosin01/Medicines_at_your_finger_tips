It is an iodinated contrast agent. Contrast agents are used to create a clear picture of the different parts of the body during certain medical procedures (eg, CT scans).</p><p>Iohexol is to be given only by or under the supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using iohexol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For iohexol, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to iohexol or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of iohexol in children.
