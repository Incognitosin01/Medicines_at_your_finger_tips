A lack of clotting factors can cause uncontrolled bleeding, as the blood is unable to clot properly. This medicine works by temporarily raising levels of these factor XIII in the blood to aid in clotting.</p><p>Corifact will not treat a bleeding episode that has already begun.</p><p>Corifact may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Corifact if you are allergic to any medicine made with human plasma.</p><p>Before using Corifact, tell your doctor if you have liver disease.</p><p>You may be shown how to use an IV at home. Do not self-inject Corifact if you do not fully understand how to give the injection and properly dispose of used needles, IV tubing, and other items used to inject the medicine.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have new or worsening bleeding episodes, sudden numbness or weakness, chest pain, coughing up blood, problems with vision or speech, or pain, swelling, warmth, or redness in one or both legs.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Corifact if you are allergic to factor XIII or to any medicine made with human plasma.</p><p>To make sure Corifact is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>

Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><p>Corifact is made from human plasma (part of the blood) which may contain viruses and other infectious agents. Donated plasma is tested and treated to reduce the risk of it containing infectious agents, but there is still a small possibility it could transmit disease. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of using this medication.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take Corifact?</h2><p>Corifact is injected into a vein through an IV.
