<html><head></head><body><h1>Zyprexa IntraMuscular</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> olanzapine (oh-LAN-za-peen) (Intramuscular route)</p><p>Risk of death is increased in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs. Although the causes of death in clinical trials were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (eg, heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (eg, pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. It is unclear from these studies to what extent the mortality findings may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to patient characteristics. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis .</p><p>Patients are at risk for severe sedation (including coma) or delirium after each injection and must be observed for at least 3 hours in a registered facility with ready access to emergency response services. Because of this risk, olanzapine pamoate is available only through a restricted distribution program called olanzapine pamoate Patient Care Program and requires prescriber, healthcare facility, patient, and pharmacy enrollment. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Olanzapine pamoate is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>
