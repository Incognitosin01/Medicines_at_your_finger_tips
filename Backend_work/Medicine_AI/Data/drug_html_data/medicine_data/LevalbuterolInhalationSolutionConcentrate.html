</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution Concentrate</h2><p class="First">Levalbuterol inhalation solution (concentrate) is indicated for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in adults, adolescents, and children 6 years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease.</p><h2>Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution Concentrate Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Levalbuterol inhalation solution (concentrate) is for oral inhalation only. Dilute with sterile normal saline before administration. Administer by nebulization using with a standard jet nebulizer (with a face mask or mouthpiece) connected to an air compressor. Do not exceed recommended dose. For dosages less than 1.25 mg, the non-concentrate (i.e., levalbuterol inhalation solution, 3 mL) formulation must be used.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Children 6 to 11 Years Old:</span></span> The recommended dosage of levalbuterol inhalation solution for patients 6 to 11 years old is 0.31 mg administered three times a day, by nebulization. Routine dosing should not exceed 0.63 mg three times a day.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adults and Adolescents ≥ 12 Years Old:</span></span> The recommended starting dosage of levalbuterol inhalation solution for patients 12 years of age and older is 0.63 mg administered three times a day, every 6 to 8 hours, by nebulization.</p><p>Patients 12 years of age and older with more severe asthma or patients who do not respond adequately to a dose of 0.63 mg of levalbuterol inhalation solution may benefit from a dosage of 1.25 mg three times a day.</p><p>Patients receiving the highest dose of levalbuterol inhalation solution should be monitored closely for adverse systemic effects, and the risks of such effects should be balanced against the potential for improved efficacy.</p><p>The use of levalbuterol inhalation solution can be continued as medically indicated to help control recurring bouts of bronchospasm. During this time, most patients gain optimal benefit from regular use of the inhalation solution.</p><p>If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide the usual response this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires reevaluation of the patient and the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for anti-inflammatory treatment, e.g., corticosteroids.</p><p>The drug compatibility (physical and chemical), efficacy, and safety of levalbuterol inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established.</p><p>The safety and efficacy of levalbuterol inhalation solution have been established in clinical trials when administered using the PARI LC Jet™ and PARI LC Plus™ nebulizers, and the PARI Master<span class="Sup">®</span> Dura-Neb<span class="Sup">®</span> 2000 and Dura-Neb<span class="Sup">®</span> 3000 compressors. The safety and efficacy of levalbuterol inhalation solution when administered using other nebulizer systems have not been established.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution, USP (Concentrate) 0.5 mL unit-dose vials containing 1.25 mg of levalbuterol that must be diluted before use. Levalbuterol inhalation solution (concentrate) is available in cartons of 30 individually pouched vials.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Levalbuterol inhalation solution is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to levalbuterol or racemic albuterol. Reactions have included urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Paradoxical Bronchospasm</h3><p class="First">Levalbuterol inhalation solution can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, levalbuterol inhalation solution should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm, when associated with inhaled formulations, frequently occurs with the first use of a new vial.</p><h3>Deterioration of Asthma</h3><p class="First">Asthma may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If the patient needs more doses of levalbuterol inhalation solution than usual, this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires reevaluation of the patient and treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for anti-inflammatory treatment, e.g., corticosteroids.</p><h3>Use of Anti-Inflammatory Agents</h3><p class="First">Levalbuterol inhalation solution is not a substitute for corticosteroids. The use of beta-adrenergic agonist alone may not be adequate to control asthma in many patients. Early consideration should be given to adding anti-inflammatory agents, e.g., corticosteroids, to the therapeutic regimen.</p><h3>Cardiovascular Effects</h3><p class="First">Levalbuterol inhalation solution, like other beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients, as measured by heart rate, blood pressure, and symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of levalbuterol inhalation solution at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the t-wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, levalbuterol inhalation solution, like all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.</p><h3>Do Not Exceed Recommended Dose</h3><p class="First">Do not exceed the recommended dose. Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs in patients with asthma. The exact cause of death is unknown, but cardiac arrest following an unexpected development of a severe acute asthmatic crisis and subsequent hypoxia is suspected.</p><h3>Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of levalbuterol or racemic albuterol. Reactions have included urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema. The potential for hypersensitivity must be considered in the clinical evaluation of patients who experience immediate hypersensitivity reactions while receiving levalbuterol inhalation solution.</p><h3>Coexisting Conditions</h3><p class="First">Levalbuterol inhalation solution, like all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias; in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus; and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Clinically significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been seen in individual patients and could be expected to occur in some patients after the use of any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator.</p><p>Changes in blood glucose may occur. Large doses of intravenous racemic albuterol have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.</p><h3>Hypokalemia</h3><p class="First">As with other beta-adrenergic agonist medications, levalbuterol inhalation solution may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease is usually transient, not requiring supplementation.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of the drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First">Adverse reaction information concerning levalbuterol inhalation solution in adults and adolescents is derived from one 4-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-, and placebo-controlled trial in 362 patients with asthma 12 years of age and older. Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients receiving levalbuterol inhalation solution or racemic albuterol and more frequently than in patients receiving placebo are listed in Table 1.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Body System</span></p><p><span class="Bold">     Preferred Term</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Percent of Patients</span>*</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 75)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Levalbuterol</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Inhalation</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Solution</span></p><p><span class="Bold">1.25 mg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 73)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Levalbuterol</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Inhalation</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Solution</span></p><p><span class="Bold">0.63 mg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 72)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Racemic</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Albuterol</span></p><p><span class="Bold">2.5 mg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 74)</span></p><p class="First">Body as a Whole</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Allergic reaction</p><p class="First">1.3</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Flu syndrome</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">4.2</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Accidental injury</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Pain</p><p class="First">1.3</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">2.8</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Back pain</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First">Cardiovascular System</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Tachycardia</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First">2.8</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Migraine</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">Digestive System</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Dyspepsia</p><p class="First">1.3</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">Musculoskeletal System</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Leg cramps</p><p class="First">1.3</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">Central Nervous System</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Dizziness</p><p class="First">1.3</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Hypertonia</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Nervousness</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">9.6</p><p class="First">2.8</p><p class="First">8.1</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Tremor</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">6.8</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Anxiety</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">Respiratory System</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Cough increased</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First">4.1</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Infection viral</p><p class="First">9.3</p><p class="First">12.3</p><p class="First">6.9</p><p class="First">12.2</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Rhinitis</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First">11.1</p><p class="First">6.8</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Sinusitis</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">4.2</p><p class="First">2.7</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span>Turbinate edema</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">2.8</p><p class="First">0</p><p>The incidence of certain systemic beta-adrenergic adverse reactions (e.g., tremor, nervousness) was slightly less in the levalbuterol inhalation solution 0.63 mg group compared with the other active treatment groups.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, their frequency of reporting, or their likely beta-mediated mechanism: angioedema, anaphylaxis, arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, extrasystoles), asthma, chest pain, cough increased, dysphonia, dyspnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), metabolic acidosis, nausea, nervousness, rash, tachycardia, tremor, urticaria.</p><p>In addition, levalbuterol inhalation solution, like other sympathomimetic agents, can cause adverse reactions such as hypertension, angina, vertigo, central nervous system stimulation, sleeplessness, headache, and drying or irritation of the oropharynx.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Short-Acting Bronchodilators</h3><p class="First">Avoid concomitant use of other short-acting sympathomimetic bronchodilators or epinephrine in patients being treated with levalbuterol inhalation solution. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects.</p><h3>Beta-blockers</h3><p class="First">Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-adrenergic agonists such as levalbuterol inhalation solution, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers should be considered, although they should be administered with caution.</p><h3>Diuretics</h3><p class="First">The ECG changes or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop and thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with non-potassium-sparing diuretics. Consider monitoring potassium levels.</p><h3>Digoxin</h3><p class="First">Mean decreases of 16% and 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single-dose intravenous and oral administration of racemic albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. The clinical significance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving levalbuterol inhalation solution and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin and levalbuterol inhalation solution.</p><h3>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants</h3><p class="First">Levalbuterol inhalation solution should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of levalbuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated. Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to asthma medication, including levalbuterol inhalation solution during pregnancy.

Efficacy and safety data for levalbuterol inhalation solution in this age group are primarily available from one 3-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 1) in 211 pediatric patients between the ages of 2 and 5 years, of whom 119 received levalbuterol inhalation solution. Over the 3 week treatment period, there were no significant treatment differences in the Pediatric Asthma Questionnaire (PAQ) total score between groups receiving levalbuterol inhalation solution 0.31 mg, levalbuterol inhalation solution 0.63 mg, racemic albuterol, and placebo.

Only 5 patients 65 years of age and older were treated with levalbuterol inhalation solution in a 4-week clinical study <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12) and Clinical Studies (14)]</span> (n = 2 for 0.63 mg and n = 3 for 1.25 mg). In these patients, bronchodilation was observed after the first dose on day 1 and after 4 weeks of treatment. In general, patients 65 years of age and older should be started at a dose of 0.63 mg of levalbuterol inhalation solution. If clinically warranted due to insufficient bronchodilator response, the dose of levalbuterol inhalation solution may be increased in elderly patients as tolerated, in conjunction with frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring, to the maximum recommended daily dose <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Albuterol is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The expected symptoms with overdosage are those of excessive beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the symptoms listed under <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6)</span>, e.g., seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min., arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and sleeplessness. Hypokalemia also may occur. As with all sympathomimetic medications, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with the abuse of levalbuterol inhalation solution. Treatment consists of discontinuation of levalbuterol inhalation solution together with appropriate symptomatic therapy. The judicious use of a cardio selective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of levalbuterol inhalation solution.</p><h2>Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution Concentrate Description</h2><p class="First">Levalbuterol inhalation solution, USP (concentrate) is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free solution of the hydrochloride salt of levalbuterol, the (R)-enantiomer of the drug substance racemic albuterol. Levalbuterol hydrochloride is a relatively selective beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptor agonist <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]</span>. The chemical name for levalbuterol hydrochloride is (R)-α<span class="Sup">1</span>-[[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]methyl]-4-hydroxy-1,3-benzenedimethanol hydrochloride, and its established chemical structure is as follows:</p><p>The molecular weight of levalbuterol hydrochloride is 275.8, and its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">13</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span>•HCl. It is a white to off-white, crystalline solid, with a melting point of approximately 187°C and solubility of approximately 180 mg/mL in water.</p><p>Levalbuterol hydrochloride is the USAN modified name for (R)-albuterol hydrochloride in the United States.</p><p>Levalbuterol inhalation solution (concentrate) is supplied in 0.5 mL individually-wrapped unit-dose vials that must be diluted with normal saline before administration by nebulization. Each 0.5 mL unit-dose vial contains 1.25 mg of levalbuterol (as 1.44 mg of levalbuterol hydrochloride), sodium chloride to adjust tonicity, edetate disodium (EDTA) as a chelating agent and sulfuric acid to adjust the pH to 4.0 (3.3 to 4.5).</p><h2>Levalbuterol Inhalation Solution Concentrate - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Activation of beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic-3′, 5′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). The increase in cyclic AMP is associated with the activation of protein kinase A, which in turn inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in muscle relaxation. Levalbuterol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway. Levalbuterol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges. While it is recognized that beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there are beta-receptors in the human heart, 10% to 50% of which are beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>. However, all beta-adrenergic agonist drugs can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 20 adults with mild-to-moderate asthma received single doses of levalbuterol inhalation solution (0.31 mg, 0.63 mg, and 1.25 mg) and racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution (2.5 mg). All doses of active treatment produced a significantly greater degree of bronchodilation (as measured by percent change from pre-dose mean FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>) than placebo, and there were no significant differences between any of the active treatment arms. The bronchodilator responses to 1.25 mg of levalbuterol inhalation solution and 2.5 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution were clinically comparable over the 6 hour evaluation period, except for a slightly longer duration of action (&gt; 15% increase in FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> from baseline) after administration of 1.25 mg of levalbuterol inhalation solution. Systemic beta-adrenergic adverse effects were observed with all active doses and were generally dose-related for (R)-albuterol. Levalbuterol inhalation solution at a dose of 1.25 mg produced a slightly higher rate of systemic beta-adrenergic adverse effects than the 2.5 mg dose of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution.</p><p>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 12 adults with mild-to-moderate asthma were challenged with inhaled methacholine chloride 20 and 180 minutes following administration of a single dose of 2.5 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate, 1.25 mg of levalbuterol inhalation solution, 1.25 mg of (S)-albuterol, or placebo using a Pari LC Jet™ nebulizer. Racemic albuterol sulfate, levalbuterol inhalation solution, and (S)-albuterol had a protective effect against methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction 20 minutes after administration, although the effect of (S)-albuterol was minimal. At 180 minutes after administration, the bronchoprotective effect of 1.25 mg of levalbuterol inhalation solution was comparable to that of 2.5 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate. At 180 minutes after administration, 1.25 mg of (S)-albuterol had no bronchoprotective effect.</p><p>In a clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate asthma, comparable efficacy (as measured by change from baseline FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>) and safety (as measured by heart rate, blood pressure, ECG, serum potassium, and tremor) were demonstrated after a cumulative dose of 5 mg of levalbuterol inhalation solution (four consecutive doses of 1.25 mg administered every 30 minutes) and 10 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution (four consecutive doses of 2.5 mg administered every 30 minutes).</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The inhalation pharmacokinetics of levalbuterol inhalation solution were investigated in a randomized cross-over study in 30 healthy adults following administration of a single dose of 1.25 mg and a cumulative dose of 5 mg of levalbuterol inhalation solution and a single dose of 2.5 mg and a cumulative dose of 10 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution by nebulization using a PARI LC Jet™ nebulizer with a Dura-Neb<span class="Sup">®</span> 2000 compressor.</p><p>Following administration of a single 1.25 mg dose of levalbuterol inhalation solution, exposure to (R)-albuterol (AUC of 3.3 ng•hr/mL) was approximately 2-fold higher than following administration of a single 2.5 mg dose of racemic albuterol inhalation solution (AUC of 1.7 ng•hr/mL) (see Table 6).
