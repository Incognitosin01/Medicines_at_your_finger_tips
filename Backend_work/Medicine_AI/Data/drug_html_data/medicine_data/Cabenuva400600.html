This "lead-in dose" will help determine that you can safely use these medicines together. Follow all directions on your prescription label and use the medicines exactly as directed.</p><p>On the last day you take the tablets, you will receive your first injectable dose of this medicine. Cabenuva 400/600 is injected into a muscle once per month. A healthcare provider will give you this medicine as 2 separate injections in opposite sides of your buttocks.</p><p>One month after your first injectable dose, you will begin regular monthly Cabenuva 400/600 injections. You will be watched closely for about 10 minutes after each injection, to make sure you do not have a serious reaction.</p><p>The timing of your monthly injections is very important to the success of your HIV treatment. Your doctor may set a calendar day as your "target treatment date" to help keep you on schedule. If needed, you may receive an injection early or late, up to 7 days before or 7 days after your target date.</p><p>You must remain under the care of a doctor while receiving Cabenuva 400/600 injections. Stay on schedule to get the most benefit. Missing doses can increase your risk of HIV that is resistant to medication.</p><p>If you stop using Cabenuva 400/600, you will need to start using other HIV medicines within 1 month to prevent your condition from becoming resistant.</p><p>You will need frequent medical tests. Cabenuva 400/600 can have long lasting effects on your body (up to 12 months after your last dose). You may still need medical tests for a short time after you stop using this medicine.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss an appointment for your  Cabenuva 400/600.</p><p>If you plan to miss an injection by more than 7 days, you may need to take Cabenuva 400/600 tablets each day until your next monthly injection is due. You should start taking the tablets about 1 month after your last injection was given. If needed, daily tablets can replace this medicine injections for up to 2 months in a row.</p><p>If you miss an injection by more that 7 days and you have not started taking the medicine in tablet form, your doctor may need to decide whether or not Cabenuva 400/600 is the best treatment for you.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking  Cabenuva 400/600?</h2><p>Cabenuva 400/600 is a complete treatment for HIV.
