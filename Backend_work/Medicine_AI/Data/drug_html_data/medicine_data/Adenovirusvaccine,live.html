There is a chance that this vaccine may cause problems during pregnancy. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant for 6 weeks after receiving the vaccine. If you think you have become pregnant, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>This vaccine contains live viruses that are shed in the stool for up to 28 days after receiving the vaccine and can cause disease to other people if transmitted. Your doctor may recommend ways (eg, proper and frequent hand washing, especially right after bowel movements) to help prevent the spread of virus to other people.</p><p>You should avoid close contact with people at high risk for catching the adenovirus for 28 days after receiving this vaccine. People who are at risk for catching the virus are pregnant women, children younger than 7 years of age, and anyone who has a weak immune system that keeps them from fighting infections.</p><p>This vaccine contains albumin, which comes from human blood.
