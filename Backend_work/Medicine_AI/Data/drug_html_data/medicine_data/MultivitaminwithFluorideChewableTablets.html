Because the tablets are chewable, they provide a <span class="Italics">topical</span> as well as <span class="Italics">systemic</span> source of fluoride.  <span class="Italics">Hydroxyapatite</span> is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, <span class="Italics">fluorapatite</span>. The reaction may be expressed by the equation: </p><p>Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 2F- ------- Ca10(PO4)6F2 + 2OH- </p><p>      (Hydroxyapatite) (Fluorapatite) </p><p>Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished:</p><p>1. Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. </p><p>2. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. </p><p>3. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from the water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets</h2><p class="First">Supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins.</p><p>Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxis.</p><p><span class="Bold">M</span><span class="Bold">ultivitamin with Fluoride 0.5 mg Chewable Tablets</span><span class="Bold"> </span>provide 0.5 mg fluoride in tablet form for children 4-6 years of age in areas where the drinking water fluoride level is less than 0.3 ppm, and for children 6 years of age and above where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride.</p><p><span class="Bold">Multivitamin with Fluoride</span> <span class="Bold">0.5</span> <span class="Bold">mg Chewable Tablets</span><span class="Bold"> </span>supply significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. </p><p>Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain ten essential vitamins and the important mineral, fluoride. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplements.</p><p>Children using <span class="Bold">Multivitamin with Fluoride</span> <span class="Bold">0</span><span class="Bold">.</span><span class="Bold">5</span> <span class="Bold">mg</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Chewable Tablets</span> regularly should receive semiannual dental examinations. The regular brushing of teeth and attention to good oral hygiene practices are also essential. Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets is a prescription product for the clinical dietary management of the metabolic processes of caries prophylaxis and provides supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Keep out of the reach of children.
