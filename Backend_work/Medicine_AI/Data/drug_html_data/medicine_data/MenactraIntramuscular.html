The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria.</p><p>The following information applies only to the meningococcal vaccine used for meningococcal bacteria Groups A, C, Y, and W-135. These groups cause nearly all of the meningococcal meningitis cases in the U.S. The vaccine will not protect against infection caused by other meningococcal bacteria groups, such as Group B.</p><p>Meningococcal infection can cause life-threatening illnesses, such as meningococcal meningitis, which affects the brain, and meningococcemia, which affects the blood. Some persons with meningococcal meningitis and/or meningococcemia may die. The rate of these diseases peak in adolescence and early adulthood and are more likely to occur in persons with certain diseases or conditions that make them more susceptible to a meningococcal infection or more likely to develop serious problems from a meningococcal infection.</p><p>Immunization against meningococcal disease is recommended for persons who are at risk of getting the disease because:</p><ul>
<li>They have certain diseases or conditions that make them more susceptible to a meningococcal infection or more likely to develop serious problems from a meningococcal infection.</li>
<li>They are living in, working in, or visiting an area where there is a strong possibility of contracting meningococcal disease.</li>
