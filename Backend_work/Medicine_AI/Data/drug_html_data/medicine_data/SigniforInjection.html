</ul><h2>1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><h3>Cushing’s Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">SIGNIFOR is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing’s disease for whom pituitary surgery is not an option or has not been curative.</span></p><h2>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><h3>Recommended Dosage Range</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">The recommended dosage range of SIGNIFOR is 0.3 mg to 0.9 mg by subcutaneous injection twice a day. The recommended initial dose is either 0.6 mg or 0.9 mg twice a day. Titrate dose based on response and tolerability.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Patients should be evaluated for a treatment response [clinically meaningful reduction in 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels and/or improvement in signs or symptoms of the disease] and should continue receiving therapy with SIGNIFOR as long as benefit is derived <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies</span> <span class="Italics">(14)]</span>. Maximum UFC reduction is typically seen by two months of treatment  <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. For patients who are started on 0.6 mg twice a day, a dosage increase to 0.9 mg twice a day may be considered based on the response to the treatment, as long as the 0.6 mg dosage is well tolerated by the patient.</span></p><p>Management of suspected adverse reactions may require temporary dose reduction of SIGNIFOR. Dose reduction by 0.3 mg decrements per injection is suggested.</p><h3>Recommendations Prior to Initiation of SIGNIFOR</h3><p class="First">Prior to the start of SIGNIFOR, patients should have baseline levels of the following:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>liver tests <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></li>
<li>serum potassium and magnesium levels <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
</ul><p>Patients should also have a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and gallbladder ultrasound <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.5)]</span><span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>Treatment of patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus should be intensively optimized with anti-diabetic therapy prior to starting SIGNIFOR <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span><span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Dosage in Patients With Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B), the recommended initial dosage is 0.3 mg twice a day and the maximum dosage is 0.6 mg twice a day. Avoid the use of SIGNIFOR in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Instruct patients to:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Refer to the FDA-approved patient labeling (Instructions for Use) for detailed administration instructions.<br/></li>
<li>Prior to injection, visually inspect the product for particulate matter and discoloration. Do not use if particulates and/or discoloration are observed.<br/></li>
<li>Avoid injection in sites showing signs of inflammation or irritation.<br/></li>
<li>Prior to injection, gently pinch the skin at the injection site and hold the needle/syringe at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. <br/></li>
<li>Administer SIGNIFOR subcutaneously by self-injection into the top of the thigh or the abdomen.<br/></li>
<li>Avoid multiple subcutaneous injections at the same site within short periods of time. Use of the same injection site for 2 consecutive injections is not recommended.<br/></li>
<li>If a dose of SIGNIFOR is missed, the next injection should be administered at the scheduled time. Do not double doses to make up for a missed dose.</li>
</ul><h2>3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Injection: 0.3 mg/mL, 0.6 mg/mL, and 0.9 mg/mL in a single-dose, 1 mL colorless glass ampule.</span></p><h2>4 CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">None.</span></p><h2>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>Hypocortisolism</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment with SIGNIFOR leads to suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion in Cushing’s disease. Suppression of ACTH may lead to a decrease in circulating levels of cortisol and potentially hypocortisolism.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Monitor and instruct patients on the signs and symptoms associated with hypocortisolism (e.g., weakness, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hyponatremia, or hypoglycemia). If hypocortisolism occurs, consider temporary dose reduction or interruption of treatment with SIGNIFOR, as well as temporary, exogenous glucocorticoid replacement therapy.</span></p><h3>Hyperglycemia and Diabetes</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="following_xmChange">Blood glucose elevations have been seen in healthy volunteers and patients treated with SIGNIFOR. In the clinical study <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>, patients developed pre-diabetes and diabetes. Nearly all patients in the study, including those with normal glucose status at baseline, pre-diabetes, and diabetes, developed worsening glycemia in the first two weeks of treatment. Cushing’s disease patients with poor glycemic control (HbA1c &gt; 8%) may be at a higher risk of developing severe hyperglycemia and associated complications, e.g., ketoacidosis.</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Assess the patient’s glycemic status prior to starting treatment with SIGNIFOR. In patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, optimize anti-diabetic therapy prior to SIGNIFOR initiation. Glycemic monitoring should be done every week for the first two to three months and periodically thereafter, as well as over the first two to four weeks after any dose increase. If hyperglycemia develops, initiate or adjust anti-diabetic treatment per standard of care. If uncontrolled hyperglycemia persists despite appropriate treatment, reduce the dose or discontinue SIGNIFOR and perform glycemic monitoring according to clinical practice. Patients who were initiated on anti-diabetic treatment as a result of SIGNIFOR require closer monitoring after discontinuation of SIGNIFOR, especially if the anti-diabetic therapy has a risk of causing hypoglycemia.</span></p><h3>Bradycardia and QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Bradycardia</span></p><p>Bradycardia has been reported with the use of SIGNIFOR  <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>. Patients with cardiac disease and/or risk factors for bradycardia, such as history of clinically significant bradycardia, high-grade heart block, or concomitant use of drugs associated with bradycardia, should be carefully monitored. Dose adjustments of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or correction of electrolyte disturbances may be necessary.</p><p><span class="Bold">QT Prolongation</span></p><p>SIGNIFOR is associated with QT prolongation. In two thorough QT studies with SIGNIFOR, QT prolongation occurred at therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses. SIGNIFOR should be used with caution in patients who are at significant risk of developing prolongation of QTc, such as those:</p><ul>
<li>with congenital long QT prolongation.</li>
<li>with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or clinically significant bradycardia.</li>
<li>on anti-arrhythmic therapy or other substances that are known to lead to QT prolongation.</li>
<li>with hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia.</li>
</ul><p>A baseline ECG is recommended prior to initiating therapy with SIGNIFOR and monitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to SIGNIFOR administration and should be monitored periodically during therapy.</p><h3>Liver Test Elevations</h3><p class="First">In the Phase III trial, 5% of patients had an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the entire clinical development program of SIGNIFOR, there were 4 cases of concurrent elevations in ALT greater than 3 x ULN and bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN: one patient with Cushing’s disease and 3 healthy volunteers <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>. In these cases, total bilirubin elevations were seen either concomitantly or preceding the transaminase elevation.</p><p>Monitoring of liver tests should be done after 1- to 2 weeks on treatment, then monthly for 3 months, and every 6 months thereafter. If ALT is normal at baseline and elevations of ALT of 3-5 times the ULN are observed on treatment, repeat the test within a week or within 48 hours if exceeding 5 times ULN. If ALT is abnormal at baseline and elevations of ALT of 3 to 5 times the baseline values are observed on treatment, repeat the test within a week or sooner if exceeding 5 times ULN. Tests should be done in a laboratory that can provide same-day results. If the values are confirmed or rising, interrupt SIGNIFOR treatment and investigate for probable cause of the findings, which may or may not be SIGNIFOR-related. Serial measures of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, should be done weekly, or more frequently, if any value exceeds 5 times the baseline value in case of abnormal baselines, or 5 times the ULN in case of normal baselines. If resolution of abnormalities to normal or near normal occurs, resuming treatment with SIGNIFOR may be done cautiously, with close observation, and only if some other likely cause has been found.</p><h3>Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Cholelithiasis has been frequently reported in clinical studies with SIGNIFOR  <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>. There have been postmarketing reports of cholelithiasis (gallstones) resulting in complications, including cholecystitis or cholangitis and requiring cholecystectomy in patients taking SIGNIFOR. Ultrasonic examination of the gallbladder before, and periodically during SIGNIFOR therapy is recommended. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue SIGNIFOR and treat appropriately.</span></p><h3>Monitoring for Deficiency of Pituitary Hormones</h3><p class="First">As the pharmacological activity of SIGNIFOR mimics that of somatostatin, inhibition of pituitary hormones, other than ACTH, may occur. Monitoring of pituitary function [e.g., thyroid-stimulating harmone (TSH)/free T <span class="Sub">4</span>, GH/IGF-1] should occur prior to initiation of therapy with SIGNIFOR and periodically during treatment should be considered as clinically appropriate. Patients who have undergone transsphenoidal surgery and pituitary irradiation are particularly at increased risk for deficiency of pituitary hormones.</p><h2>6ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinically significant adverse reactions that appear in other sections of the labeling include:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Bold">Hypocortisolism <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span><br/></span></li>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>A total of 162 Cushing’s disease patients were exposed to SIGNIFOR in the Phase III study  <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. At study entry, patients were randomized to receive twice a day doses of either 0.6 mg or 0.9 mg of SIGNIFOR given subcutaneously. The mean age of patients was approximately 40 years old with a predominance of female patients (78%). The majority of the patients had persistent or recurrent Cushing’s disease (83%) and few patients (≤ 5%) in either treatment group had received previous pituitary irradiation. The median exposure to the treatment was 10.4 months (0.03-37.8) with 68% of patients having at least 6-months exposure.</p><p>In the Phase III trial, adverse reactions were reported in 98% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥ 20% in either group) were diarrhea, nausea, hyperglycemia, cholelithiasis, headache, abdominal pain, fatigue, and diabetes mellitus. There were no deaths during the study. Serious adverse events were reported in 25% of patients. Adverse events leading to study discontinuation were reported in 17% of patients.</p><p>Adverse reactions with an overall frequency higher than 5% are presented in Table 1 by randomized dose group and overall. Adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions listed first.</p><p>Other notable adverse reactions which occurred with a frequency less than 5% were: anemia (4%), blood amylase increased (2%), and prothrombin time prolonged (2%).</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal Disorders</span></p><p>Gastrointestinal disorders, predominantly diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting were reported frequently in the Phase III trial (see Table 1). These events began to develop primarily during the first month of treatment with SIGNIFOR and required no intervention.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hyperglycemia and Diabetes</span></p><p>Hyperglycemia-related terms were reported frequently in the Phase III trial. For all patients, these terms included: hyperglycemia (40%), diabetes mellitus (18%), increased HbA1c (11%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (9%). In general, increases in FPG and HbA1c were seen soon after initiation of SIGNIFOR and were sustained during the treatment period. In the SIGNIFOR 0.6 mg group, mean FPG levels increased from 98.6 mg/dL at baseline to 125.1 mg/dL at Month 6. In the SIGNIFOR 0.9 mg group, mean fasting FPG levels increased from 97.0 mg/dL at baseline to 128.0 mg/dL at Month 6. In the SIGNIFOR 0.6 mg group, HbA1c increased from 5.8% at baseline to 7.2% at Month 6. In the SIGNIFOR 0.9 mg group, HbA1c increased from 5.8% at baseline to 7.3% at Month 6 <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p>At one-month follow-up visits, following discontinuation of SIGNIFOR, mean FPG and HbA1c levels decreased but remained above baseline values. Long-term follow-up data are not available.</p><p><span class="Italics">Elevated Liver Tests</span></p><p>In the Phase III trial, there were transient mean elevations in aminotransferase values in patients treated with SIGNIFOR. Mean values returned to baseline levels by Month 4 of treatment. The elevations were not associated with clinical symptoms of hepatic disease.</p><p>In the clinical development program of SIGNIFOR, there were 4 patients with concurrent elevations in ALT greater than 3 x ULN and bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN: one patient with Cushing’s disease and 3 healthy volunteers <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>. In all 4 cases, the elevations were noted within the first 10 days of treatment. In all of these cases, total bilirubin elevations were seen either concomitantly or preceding the transaminase elevation. The patient with Cushing’s disease developed jaundice. All 4 cases had resolution of the laboratory abnormalities with discontinuation of SIGNIFOR.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hypocortisolism</span></p><p>Cases of hypocortisolism were reported in the Phase III study in Cushing’s disease patients <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. The majority of cases were manageable by reducing the dose of SIGNIFOR and/or adding low-dose, short-term glucocorticoid therapy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Injection-Site Reactions</span></p><p>Injection-site reactions were reported in 17% of patients enrolled in the Phase III trial in Cushing’s disease. The events were most frequently reported as local pain, erythema, hematoma, hemorrhage, and pruritus. These events resolved spontaneously and required no intervention.</p><p><span class="Bold">Thyroid Function</span></p><p>Hypothyroidism, with the use of SIGNIFOR, was reported for seven patients participating in the Phase III study in Cushing’s disease. All seven patients presented with a TSH close to or below the lower limit at study entry, which precludes establishing a conclusive relationship between the adverse event and the use of SIGNIFOR.</p><p><span class="Italics">Other Abnormal Laboratory Findings</span></p><p>Asymptomatic and reversible elevations in lipase and amylase were observed in patients receiving SIGNIFOR in clinical studies. Pancreatitis is a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of somatostatin analogs due to the association between cholelithiasis and acute pancreatitis.</p><p>For hemoglobin levels, mean decreases that remained within normal range were observed. Also, post-baseline elevations in prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were noted in 33% and 47% of patients, respectively. The PT and PTT elevations were minimal.</p><p>These laboratory findings are of unclear clinical significance.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of SIGNIFOR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><ul>
<li>Cholelithiasis resulting in complications, including cholecystitis and cholangitis, which have sometimes required cholecystectomy</li>
</ul><h2>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS</h2><h3>Effects of Other Drugs on SIGNIFOR</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Drugs That Prolong QT</span></span></p><p>Coadministration of drugs that prolong the QT interval with SIGNIFOR may have additive effects on the prolongation of the QT interval. Caution is required when coadministering SIGNIFOR with drugs that may prolong the QT interval <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Effects of SIGNIFOR on Other Drugs</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cyclosporine</span></p><p>Concomitant administration of cyclosporine with pasireotide may decrease the relative bioavailability of cyclosporine and, therefore, dose adjustment of cyclosporine to maintain therapeutic levels may be necessary.</p><p><span class="Bold">Bromocriptine</span></p><p>Coadministration of somatostatin analogues with bromocriptine may increase the blood levels of bromocriptine. Dose reduction of bromocriptine may be necessary.</p><h2>8USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>The limited data with SIGNIFOR in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In embryo-fetal development studies in rabbits, findings indicating developmental delay were observed with subcutaneous administration of pasireotide during organogenesis at doses less than the exposure in humans at the highest recommended dose; maternal toxicity was not observed at this dose <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In embryo-fetal development studies in rats given 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg/day subcutaneously throughout organogenesis, maternal toxicity was observed at all doses, including the lowest dose tested which had exposures 4 times higher than that at the maximum therapeutic dose based on area under the curve (AUC) comparisons across species. An increased incidence of early/total resorptions and malrotated limbs was observed in rats at 10 mg/kg/day. At 10 mg/kg/day in rats, the maternal systemic exposure (AUC) was 42179 ng*hr/mL, approximately 144 times the exposure in humans at the highest recommended dose of 900 mcg SIGNIFOR administered as a subcutaneous injection twice a day.</p><p>In embryo-fetal development studies in rabbits given 0.05, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day subcutaneously through organogenesis, maternal toxicity was observed at 1 mg/kg/day, at a maternal systemic exposure (AUC) of 1906 ng*hr/mL, approximately 7 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure. An increased incidence of unossified forepaw phalanx, indicative of a developmental retardation, was observed in rabbits at 0.05 mg/kg/day, with maternal systemic exposures less than the systemic exposure in humans at the highest recommended dose.</p><p>In pre- and post-natal developmental studies in rats given subcutaneous doses of 2, 5, and 10 mg/kg/day during gestation through lactation and weaning, maternal toxicity was observed at all doses, including the lowest dose (12 times higher than the maximum therapeutic dose based on surface area comparisons across species). Retardation of physiological growth, attributed to GH inhibition was observed at 2 mg/kg/day during a pre- and post-natal study in rats. After weaning, body weight gains in the rat pups (F1 generation) exposed to pasireotide were comparable to controls, showing reversibility of this developmental delay.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information available on the presence of SIGNIFOR in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies show that pasireotide administered subcutaneously passes into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for SIGNIFOR and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from SIGNIFOR or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>Available data in animals have shown excretion of pasireotide in milk. After a single 1 mg/kg [ <span class="Sup">14</span>C]-pasireotide subcutaneous dose to lactating rats, the transfer of radioactivity into milk was observed. The overall milk:plasma (M/P) exposure ratio of total radioactivity was 0.28, based on AUC <span class="Sub">0-∞</span> values.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as the therapeutic benefits of a reduction or normalization of serum cortisol levels in female patients with Cushing’s disease treated with pasireotide may lead to improved fertility.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of SIGNIFOR have not been established in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of SIGNIFOR did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy  <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh A), but is required for patients with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh B) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Avoid the use of SIGNIFOR in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment of SIGNIFOR in patients with impaired renal function is required <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>10 OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">No cases of overdosage have been reported in patients with Cushing’s disease receiving SIGNIFOR subcutaneously. Doses up to 2.1 mg twice a day have been used in healthy volunteers with adverse reactions of diarrhea being observed at a high frequency.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">In the event of overdosage, it is recommended that appropriate supportive treatment be initiated, as dictated by the patient’s clinical status, until resolution of the symptoms.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose can be obtained from a certified Regional Poison Center.

Pasireotide exerts its pharmacological activity via binding to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). Five human somatostatin receptor subtypes are known: SSTR 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. These receptor subtypes are expressed in different tissues under normal physiological conditions. Corticotroph tumor cells from Cushing’s disease patients frequently over-express SSTR5 whereas the other receptor subtypes are often not expressed or are expressed at lower levels. Pasireotide binds and activates the SSTRs resulting in inhibition of ACTH secretion, which leads to decreased cortisol secretion.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">The binding affinities of endogenous somatostatin and pasireotide are shown in Table 2.</span></p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Glucose Metabolism</span></p><p>In a randomized, double-blind mechanism study conducted in healthy volunteers, the development of hyperglycemia with pasireotide at doses of 0.6 mg twice a day and 0.9 mg twice a day was related to significant decreases in insulin secretion as well as incretin hormones (i.e., glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP]) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>QTcI interval was evaluated in a randomized, blinded, crossover study in healthy subjects investigating pasireotide doses of 0.6 mg twice a day and 1.95 mg twice a day. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) placebo-subtracted QTcI change from baseline was 12.7 (14.7) ms and 16.6 (18.6) ms, respectively. Both pasireotide doses decreased heart rate, with a maximum mean (95% lower confidence bound) placebo-subtracted change from baseline of -10.9 (-11.9) beats per minute (bpm) observed at 1.5 hours for pasireotide 0.6 mg twice a day, and -15.2 (-16.5) bpm at 0.5 hours for pasireotide 1.95 mg twice a day. The supra-therapeutic dose (1.95 mg twice a day) produced mean steady-state C <span class="Sub">max</span> values 3.3-fold the mean C <span class="Sub">max</span> for the 0.6 mg twice a day dose in the study.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">In healthy volunteers, pasireotide demonstrates approximately linear pharmacokinetics (PK) for a dose range from 0.0025 to 1.5 mg. In Cushing’s disease patients, pasireotide demonstrates linear dose-exposure relationship in a dose range from 0.3 mg to 1.2 mg.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption and Distribution</span></p><p>In healthy volunteers, pasireotide peak plasma concentration is reached within T <span class="Sub">max</span> 0.25-0.5 hour. C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC are dose-proportional following administration of single and multiple doses.</p><p>No studies have been conducted to evaluate the absolute bioavailability of pasireotide in humans. Food effect is unlikely to occur since SIGNIFOR is administered via a parenteral route.</p><p>In healthy volunteers, pasireotide is widely distributed with large apparent volume of distribution (V <span class="Sub">z</span>/F &gt; 100 L). Distribution between blood and plasma is concentration independent and shows that pasireotide is primarily located in the plasma (91%). Plasma protein binding is moderate (88%) and independent of concentration.</p><p>Pasireotide has low passive permeability and is likely to be a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but the impact of P-gp on ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) of pasireotide is expected to be low. In clinical testing in healthy volunteers, P-gp inhibition (e.g., verapamil) did not affect the rate or extent of pasireotide availability. Pasireotide is not a substrate of efflux transporter BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein), influx transporter OCT1 (organic cation transporter 1), or influx transporters OATP (organic anion-transporting polypeptide) 1B1, 1B3, or 2B1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Excretion</span></p><p>Pasireotide was shown to be metabolically stable in human liver and kidney microsomes systems. In healthy volunteers, pasireotide in its unchanged form is the predominant form found in plasma, urine, and feces. Somatropin may increase CYP450 enzymes and, therefore, suppression of growth hormone secretion by somatostatin analogs, including pasireotide may decrease the metabolic clearance of compounds metabolized by CYP450 enzymes.</p><p>Pasireotide is eliminated mainly via hepatic clearance (biliary excretion) with a small contribution of the renal route. In a human ADME study 55.9 ± 6.63% of the radioactivity dose was recovered over the first 10 days post dosing, including 48.3 ± 8.16% of the radioactivity in feces and 7.63 ± 2.03% in urine.</p><p>The clearance (CL/F) of pasireotide in healthy volunteers and Cushing’s disease patients is ~7.6 L/h and ~3.8 L/h, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Steady-State Pharmacokinetics</span></p><p>Following multiple subcutaneous doses, pasireotide demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 0.05 to 0.6 mg once a day in healthy volunteers, and 0.3 mg to 1.2 mg twice a day in Cushing’s disease patients. Based on the accumulation ratios of AUC, the calculated effective half-life (t <span class="Sub">1/2,eff</span>) in healthy volunteers was approximately 12 hours (on average between 10 and 13 hours for 0.05, 0.2 and 0.6 mg once a day doses).</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>Population PK analyses of SIGNIFOR indicate that race, body weight, age, and gender do not have a clinically relevant influence on PK parameters.

Rats were given daily subcutaneous doses of pasireotide at 0.01, 0.05, 0.3 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks. There were no drug-related tumors in rats at exposures up to 7-fold higher than the maximum recommended clinical exposure at the 1.8 mg/day dose. Mice were given subcutaneous doses of pasireotide at 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks and did not identify any carcinogenic potential.</p><p><span class="Italics">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Pasireotide was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro assays (Ames mutation test in <span class="Italics">Salmonella</span> and <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span> and mutation test in human peripheral lymphocytes). Pasireotide was not genotoxic in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> rat bone marrow nucleus test.</p><p><span class="Italics">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Subcutaneous dosing at 0.1 mg/kg/day before mating and continuing into gestation in rats at exposures less than the human clinical exposure based on body surface area comparisons across species resulted in statistically significant increased implantation loss and decreased viable fetuses, corpora lutea, and implantation sites. Abnormal cycles or acyclicity were observed at 1 mg/kg/day (5-fold higher than the maximum therapeutic exposure based on surface area, comparisons across species).</p><h2>14 CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">A Phase III, multicenter, randomized study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two dose levels of SIGNIFOR over a 6-month treatment period in Cushing’s disease patients with persistent or recurrent disease despite pituitary surgery or <span class="Italics">de novo</span> patients for whom surgery was not indicated or who had refused surgery.</span></p><p>Patients with a baseline 24-hour urine free cortisol (UFC) &gt;1.5 x ULN were randomized to receive a SIGNIFOR dosage of either 0.6 mg subcutaneous twice a day or 0.9 mg subcutaneous twice a day. After 3 months of treatment, patients with a mean 24-hour UFC ≤ 2.0 x ULN and below or equal to their baseline values continued blinded treatment at the randomized dose until Month 6. Patients who did not meet these criteria were unblinded and the dose was increased by 0.3 mg twice a day. After the initial 6 months in the study, patients entered an additional 6-month open-label treatment period. The dosage could be reduced by 0.3 mg twice a day at any time during the study for intolerability.</p><p>A total of 162 patients were enrolled in this study. The majority of patients were female (78%) and had persistent or recurrent Cushing’s disease despite pituitary surgery (83%) with a mean age of 40 years. A few patients (4%) in either treatment group received previous pituitary irradiation. The median value of the baseline 24-hour UFC for all patients was 565 nmol/24 hours (normal range 30 to 145 nmol/24 hours). About two-thirds of all randomized patients completed 6 months of treatment.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved normalization of mean 24-hour UFC levels after 6 months of treatment and did not dose increase during this period.</p><p><span class="Bold">24-Hour Urinary Free Cortisol Results</span></p><p>At Month 6, the percentages of responders for the primary endpoint were 15% and 26% in the 0.6 mg twice a day and 0.9 mg twice a day groups, respectively (Table 3). The percentages of patients with mUFC ≤ ULN or ≥ 50% reduction from baseline, a less stringent endpoint than the primary endpoint, were 34% in the 0.6 mg twice a day and 41% in the 0.9 mg twice a day groups. Dose increases appeared to have minimal effect on 24-hour UFC response. Mean and median percentage changes in UFC from baseline are presented in Table 3.</p><p>SIGNIFOR resulted in a decrease in the mean 24-hour UFC after 1 month of treatment (Figure 1). For patients (n = 78) who stayed in the trial, similar UFC lowering was observed at Month 12.</p><p>Note: Only patients who completed 6 months of treatment are included in this analysis (n = 110). The reference line is the ULN for UFC, which is 145 nmol/24hour; +/-Standard errors are displayed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Other Endpoints</span></p><p>Decreases from baseline for blood pressure were observed at Month 6, including patients who did not receive any anti-hypertensive medication. However, due to the fact that the study allowed initiation of anti-hypertensive medication and dose increases in patients already receiving such medications, the individual contribution of SIGNIFOR or of anti-hypertensive medication adjustments cannot be clearly established.</p><p>The mean decreases from baseline at Month 6 for weight, body mass index, and waist circumference were 4.4 kg, 1.6 kg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> and 2.6 cm, respectively. Individual patients showed varying degrees of improvement in Cushing's disease manifestations, but because of the variability in response and the absence of a control group in this trial, it is uncertain whether these changes could be ascribed to the effects of SIGNIFOR.</p><h2>16HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">SIGNIFOR is supplied as a single dose, colorless glass ampule packaged in a box of 60 ampules, arranged in 10 packs of 6 ampules each.
