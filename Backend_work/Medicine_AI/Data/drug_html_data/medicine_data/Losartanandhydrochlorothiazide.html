High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure may reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.</p><p>Losartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination is also used to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with high blood pressure and enlargement of the heart.</p><p>Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes the blood vessels to tighten. Losartan relaxes the blood vessels and lowers the blood pressure. A lower blood pressure will increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.</p><p>Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill) . It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure.</p><p>Losartan and hydrochlorothiazide is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using losartan and hydrochlorothiazide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For losartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to losartan and hydrochlorothiazide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted side effects, which may require caution in patients receiving losartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking losartan and hydrochlorothiazide, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using losartan and hydrochlorothiazide with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
