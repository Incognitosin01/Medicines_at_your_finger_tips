Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing substances in the body that cause pain and inflammation.</p><p>Misoprostol reduces stomach acid and replaces protective substances in the stomach that are reduced by NSAIDs. Misoprostol protects the lining of the esophagus, stomach and intestines while taking diclofenac.</p><p>Arthrotec is a prescription medicine used to treat osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in people at high risk for developing stomach or intestinal ulcers.</p><p>Arthrotec is supplied as delayed-release tablets containing 50 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol or 75 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use Arthrotec if you are pregnant.
