TriStart DHA™ can also be beneficial in improving the nutritional status of women prior to conception.1</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">TriStart DHA™ is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</span></p><p class="First">Caution is recommended in patients taking anticonvulsant medications as folate may interfere with anticonvulsant medication, and may lower seizure threshold. Furthermore, anticonvulsant medications may interfere with folate metabolism.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where Vitamin B12 is deficient. Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations progress.</p><p>Ingestion of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids (such as DHA and EPA) per day has been shown to have potential antithrombotic effects, including an increased bleeding time and International Normalized Ratio (INR). Administration of omega-3 fatty acids should be avoided in patients taking anticoagulants and in those known to have an inherited or acquired predisposition to bleeding.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.</p><p>You should call your doctor for medical advice about serious adverse events.
