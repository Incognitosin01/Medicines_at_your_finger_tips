CAPS is a rare, inherited disease of the immune system.</p><p>Canakinumab injection is also used to treat tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF).</p><p>Canakinumab injection is also used to treat active Still's disease, including adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA).</p><p>CAPS, TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and FMF are autoinflammatory periodic fever syndromes and Still's disease is an autoinflammatory disease. Autoinflammatory conditions occur when the body produces too much of a chemical called interleukin-1 beta. This chemical causes inflammation (swelling) and patients may have a fever, headache, skin rash, joint or muscle pain, or unusual tiredness or weakness. Canakinumab is an interleukin-1 beta blocker. It helps prevent inflammation by keeping the interleukin-1 beta from working properly.</p><p>Canakinumab is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using canakinumab</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
