</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">in ARTHROMATIC Plastic Container</span></p><h2>Sodium Chloride Irrigation Baxter Description</h2><p class="First">0.9% Sodium Chloride Irrigation, USP is a sterile nonpyrogenic, isotonic solution in a single dose ARTHROMATIC plastic container for use as an arthroscopic irrigating solution. Each liter contains 9 g Sodium Chloride, USP (NaCl) in Water for Injection. pH 5.5 (4.5 to 7.0). Milliequivalents per liter: Sodium - 154, Chloride - 154. Osmolarity 308 mOsmol/L (calc.). No antimicrobial agent has been added.</p><p>The ARTHROMATIC plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride (PL 146 Plastic). The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period, e.g., di-2-ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP), up to 5 parts per million. However, the safety of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies.</p><h2>Sodium Chloride Irrigation Baxter - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">0.9% Sodium Chloride Irrigation, USP is useful as an irrigating fluid for body joints because the solution is isotonic, and provides a transparent fluid medium with optical properties suitable for good visualization of the interior joint surface during endoscopic examination. During arthroscopic surgical procedures, the solution acts as a lavage for removing blood, tissue fragments, and bone fragments.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Sodium Chloride Irrigation Baxter</h2><p class="First">0.9% Sodium Chloride Irrigation, USP is indicated for use as an arthroscopic irrigating fluid with endoscopic instruments during arthroscopic procedures requiring distension and irrigation of the knee, shoulder, elbow, or other bone joints.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None known.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Not for injection.</p><p>Because fluids used to irrigate joints may be absorbed into the general circulation, solutions containing sodium ion should be used with great care in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency, and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention.</p><p>The contents of an opened container should be used promptly to minimize the possibility of bacterial growth or pyrogen formation. Discard the unused portion of irrigating solution since no antimicrobial agent has been added.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Because some of the fluid used to irrigate joints may be absorbed, caution must be exercised in the volume of irrigating fluid used especially with solutions containing the sodium ion in patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><p>Do not administer unless the solution is clear and the seal is intact.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">None known.</p><h2>Sodium Chloride Irrigation Baxter Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The volume of solution needed will vary with the nature and duration of the arthroscopic procedure.</p><p>If desired, warm in overpouch to near body temperature in a water bath or oven heated to not more than 45º C.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.</p><h2>How is Sodium Chloride Irrigation Baxter Supplied</h2><p class="First">0.9% Sodium Chloride Irrigation, USP in ARTHROMATIC Plastic Container is available as follows:</p><p>Exposure of pharmaceutical products to heat should be minimized. Avoid excessive heat. It is recommended the product be stored at room temperature (25º C); brief exposure up to 40º C does not adversely affect the product.</p><h2>DIRECTIONS FOR USE</h2><p class="First">Tear overwrap down side at slit and remove solution container. Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed. This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety. The opacity will diminish gradually. Check for minute leaks by squeezing bag firmly. If leaks are found, discard solution as sterility may be impaired.</p><p>Use Aseptic Technique.</p><p><span class="Bold">Baxter Healthcare Corporation</span></p><p>Deerfield, IL 60015 USA</p><p>Printed in USA</p><p><span class="Bold">07-19-44-646</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Rev.
