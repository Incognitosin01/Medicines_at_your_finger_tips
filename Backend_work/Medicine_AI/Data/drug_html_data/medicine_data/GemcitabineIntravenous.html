Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may occur after treatment with gemcitabine has been stopped.</p><p>Gemcitabine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using gemcitabine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For gemcitabine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to gemcitabine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of gemcitabine injection in the pediatric population. However, because of this medication's toxicity, it should be used with caution, after less toxic alternatives have been considered or found ineffective. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of gemcitabine injection in the elderly. However, elderly women patients are more sensitive to the effects of gemcitabine than younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using gemcitabine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of gemcitabine</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you gemcitabine in a medical facility. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. Gemcitabine must be given slowly, so the needle should stay in place for at least 30 minutes.</p><p>Gemcitabine often causes nausea and vomiting. It can also cause flu-like symptoms such as chills, fever, general feeling of illness, headache, muscle pain, and weakness. It is very important that you continue to receive the medicine even if it makes you feel ill. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for ways to lessen these effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using gemcitabine</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that gemcitabine is working properly. Blood and urine tests will be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Receiving gemcitabine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. It may also cause birth defects if the father is receiving it when his sexual partner becomes pregnant. Female patients should use effective birth control during treatment with gemcitabine and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Male patients who have female partners should use effective birth control during treatment with gemcitabine and for at least 3 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving gemcitabine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Gemcitabine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are needed for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Also, check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>Gemcitabine may cause lung problems (eg, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome), which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you have new or worsening cough, fever, chest tightness, or trouble breathing.</p><p>Gemcitabine may cause kidney problems, including hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy, and kidney failure. Check with your doctor right away if you have stomach pain, blood in the urine, fever, increased or decreased urination, pinpoint red spots on the skin, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, unusual bleeding or bruising, unusual tiredness or weakness, or yellow eyes or skin.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.</p><p>Gemcitabine may cause a condition called capillary leak syndrome. It can cause fluid to leak from the blood vessels into your body's tissues. Call your doctor right away if you have swelling or puffiness and are urinating less often, trouble breathing, feeling of fullness, dizziness, or feeling faint.</p><p>Tell your doctor right away if you have seizures, headache, confusion, vision problems, unusual drowsiness, tiredness, or weakness. These could be symptoms of a serious nervous system problem called posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).</p><p>If you plan to have children, talk with your doctor before receiving gemcitabine. Some men using gemcitabine have become infertile (unable to have children).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Gemcitabine side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
