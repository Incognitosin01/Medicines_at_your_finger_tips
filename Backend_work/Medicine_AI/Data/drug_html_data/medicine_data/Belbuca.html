Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p>Buprenorphine can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. You should not breastfeed while you are using Belbuca.</p><p>Belbuca is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use Belbuca?</h2><p>Use Belbuca exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Buprenorphine can slow or stop your breathing. Never use Belbuca in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain.</p><p>Buprenorphine may be habit-forming, even at regular doses. Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. <b>MISUSE OF NARCOTIC MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Selling or giving away Belbuca is against the law.</p><p>Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>Drink a glass of water to moisten your mouth. Use dry hands when handling the buccal film. Place the film against the inside of your cheek and hold it in place for 5 seconds. Once in place, the film will dissolve completely in about 30 minutes. Do not chew the film or swallow it whole.</p><p>Do not eat or drink anything until the Belbuca film has completely dissolved in your mouth.</p><p>While using Belbuca, you may need frequent blood tests to check your liver function.</p><p>If you need surgery, tell the surgeon ahead of time that you are using Belbuca.</p><p>Do not stop using Belbuca suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using buprenorphine.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep the medicine in a place where a child cannot get to it. Keep track of your medicine. Buprenorphine is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Do not keep leftover opioid medication. <b>Just one dose can cause death in someone using this medicine accidentally or improperly.</b> Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, remove any unused films from the foil pack and flush the films down the toilet. Throw the empty foil pack into the trash.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since this medicine is used for pain, you are not likely to miss a dose. Skip any missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>A buprenorphine overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b></p><p>Overdose symptoms may include extreme drowsiness or weakness, cold or clammy skin, severe muscle weakness, pinpoint pupils, weak pulse, very slow breathing, or coma.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using Belbuca?</h2><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><p>Avoid applying the buccal film to an area where you have a mouth sore.</p><p>Buprenorphine may impair your thinking or reactions. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how Belbuca will affect you. Dizziness or severe drowsiness can cause falls, accidents, or severe injuries.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Belbuca side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Belbuca</b>: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Like other narcotic medicines, buprenorphine can slow your breathing.
