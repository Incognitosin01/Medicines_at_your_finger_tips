Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Selinexor is usually taken with dexamethasone on just 2 specific days each week.

You may need a transfusion if your blood platelets get too low.</p><p>Selinexor can lower your sodium levels. This may not cause any symptoms so your blood will need to be tested.
