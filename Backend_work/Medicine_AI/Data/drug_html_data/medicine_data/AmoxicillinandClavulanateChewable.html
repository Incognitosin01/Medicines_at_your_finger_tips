</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Chewable</h2><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets USP, Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension USP, and Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets USP (Chewable) and other antibacterial drugs, Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets USP, Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension USP, and Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets USP (Chewable) should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><p>Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets USP, Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension USP, and Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets USP (Chewable) are combination penicillin-class antibacterials and beta-lactamase inhibitors indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible isolates of the designated bacteria in the conditions listed below*:</p><h3>Lower Respiratory Tract Infections</h3><p class="First">– caused by beta-lactamase–producing isolates of <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span> and <span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</span>.</p><h3>Acute Bacterial Otitis Media</h3><p class="First">– caused by beta-lactamase–producing isolates of <span class="Italics">H. influenzae</span> and <span class="Italics">M. catarrhalis</span>.</p><h3>Sinusitis</h3><p class="First">– caused by beta-lactamase–producing isolates of <span class="Italics">H. influenzae</span> and <span class="Italics">M. catarrhalis</span>.</p><h3>Skin and Skin Structure Infections</h3><p class="First">– caused by beta-lactamase–producing isolates of <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span>, <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>, and <span class="Italics">Klebsiella</span> species.</p><h3>Urinary Tract Infections</h3><p class="First">– caused by beta-lactamase–producing isolates of <span class="Italics">E. coli</span>, <span class="Italics">Klebsiella</span> species, and <span class="Italics">Enterobacter</span> species.</p><h3>Limitations of Use</h3><p class="First">– When susceptibility test results show susceptibility to amoxicillin, USP, indicating no beta-lactamase production, Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets USP, Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension USP, and Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets USP (Chewable) should not be used.</p><h2>Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Chewable Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets, Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension, and Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets (Chewable) may be taken without regard to meals; however, absorption of clavulanate potassium is enhanced when Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets, Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension, and Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets (Chewable) are administered at the start of a meal. To minimize the potential for gastrointestinal intolerance, Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets, Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension, and Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets (Chewable) should be taken at the start of a meal.</p><h3>Adults</h3><p class="First">The usual adult dose is one 500 mg/125 mg Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablet every 12 hours or one 250 mg/125 mg Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablet every 8 hours. For more severe infections and infections of the respiratory tract, the dose should be one 875 mg/125 mg Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablet every 12 hours or one 500 mg/125 mg Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablet every 8 hours. Adults who have difficulty swallowing may be given the 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL or 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL suspension in place of the 500 mg/125 mg tablet. The 200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL suspension or the 400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL suspension may be used in place of the 875 mg/125 mg tablet.</p><p>Two 250 mg/125 mg Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets should <span class="Italics">not</span> be substituted for one 500 mg/125 mg Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablet. Since both the 250 mg/125 mg and 500 mg/125 mg Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets contain the same amount of clavulanic acid (125 mg, as the potassium salt), two 250 mg/125 mg tablets are not equivalent to one 500 mg/125 mg Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablet.</p><p>The 250 mg/125 mg Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablet and the 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet should <span class="Italics">not</span> be substituted for each other, as they are not interchangeable. The 250 mg/125 mg Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablet and the 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet do not contain the same amount of clavulanic acid (as the potassium salt). The 250 mg/125 mg Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablet contains 125 mg of clavulanic acid, whereas the 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet contains 62.5 mg of clavulanic acid.</p><h3>Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">Based on the amoxicillin component, Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension should be dosed as follows:</p><p><span class="Bold">Neonates and Infants Aged &lt; 12 Weeks (&lt; 3 Months):</span> The recommended dose of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension is 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours, based on the amoxicillin component. Experience with the 200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL formulation in this age group is limited, and thus, use of the 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL oral suspension is recommended.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients Aged 12 Weeks (3 Months) and Older:</span> See dosing regimens provided in <span class="Bold">Table 1</span>. The every 12 hour regimen is recommended as it is associated with significantly less diarrhea <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>. However, the every 12 hour suspension (200 mg/5 mL and 400 mg/5 mL) and chewable tablets (200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL and 400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL) and chewable tablets (200 mg/28.5 mg and 400 mg/57 mg) contain aspartame and should not be used by phenylketonurics. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Table 1: Dosing in Patients Aged 12 Weeks (3 Months) and Older</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INFECTION</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DOSING REGIMEN</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Every 12 hours</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Every 8 hours</span></p><p class="First">200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL or<br/>

Renal impairment patients with a glomerular filtration rate of &lt; 30 mL/min should not receive the 875 mg/125 mg dose. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 10 to 30 mL/min should receive 500 mg/125 mg or 250 mg/125 mg every 12 hours, depending on the severity of the infection. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/min should receive 500 mg/125 mg or 250 mg/125 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection.</p><p>Hemodialysis patients should receive 500 mg/125 mg or 250 mg/125 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection. They should receive an additional dose both during and at the end of dialysis.</p><h3>Directions for Mixing Oral Suspension</h3><p class="First">Prepare a suspension at time of dispensing as follows: Tap bottle until all the powder flows freely. Add approximately 2/3 of the total amount of water for reconstitution (see <span class="Bold">Table 2</span> below) and shake vigorously to suspend powder. Add remainder of the water and again shake vigorously.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Table 2: Amount of Water for Mixing Oral Suspension</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Strength</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Bottle Size</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Amount of Water for Reconstitution</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Contents of Each Teaspoonful (5 mL)</span></p><p class="First">200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL</p><p class="First">100 mL</p><p class="First">92 mL</p><p class="First">200 mg amoxicillin and 28.5 mg of clavulanic acid as the potassium salt</p><p class="First">400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL</p><p class="First">100 mL</p><p class="First">87 mL</p><p class="First">400 mg amoxicillin and 57 mg of clavulanic acid as the potassium salt</p><p><span class="Bold">Note:</span> Shake oral suspension well before using.

The 250 mg/125 mg Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablet and the 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet do not contain the same amount of clavulanic acid. The 250 mg/125 mg Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablet contains 125 mg of clavulanic acid whereas the 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet contains 62.5 mg of clavulanic acid.</p><p>Two 250 mg/125 mg Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets should NOT be substituted for one 500 mg/125 mg Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablet.

These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension, and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (chewable), careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension, and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (chewable) should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><h3>Hepatic Dysfunction</h3><p class="First">Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice has been associated with the use of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium. Hepatic toxicity is usually reversible; however, deaths have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals in patients with hepatic impairment.</p><h3>Clostridium Difficile Associated Diarrhea (CDAD)</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Skin Rash in Patients With Mononucleosis</h3><p class="First">A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension, and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (chewable) should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis.</p><h3>Potential for Microbial Overgrowth</h3><p class="First">The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. If superinfection occurs, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><h3>Phenylketonurics</h3><p class="First">Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (chewable) and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension contain aspartame which contains phenylalanine. Each 200 mg/28.5 mg chewable tablet of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium contains 3.4 mg phenylalanine. Each 400 mg/57 mg chewable tablet contains 6.7 mg phenylalanine. Each 5 mL of the 200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL oral suspension contains 0.67 mg phenylalanine. Each 5 mL of the 400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL oral suspension contains 1.12 mg phenylalanine. The other formulations of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium do not contain phenylalanine.</p><h3>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension, or amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (chewable) in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient, and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea/loose stools (9%), nausea (3%), skin rashes and urticaria (3%), vomiting (1%) and vaginitis (1%). Less than 3% of patients discontinued therapy because of drug-related adverse reactions. The overall incidence of adverse reactions, and in particular diarrhea, increased with the higher recommended dose. Other less frequently reported adverse reactions (&lt; 1%) include: Abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and headache.</p><p>In pediatric patients (aged 2 months to 12 years), 1 U.S./Canadian clinical trial was conducted which compared 45/6.4 mg/kg/day (divided every 12 hours) of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium for 10 days versus 40/10 mg/kg/day (divided every 8 hours) of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium for 10 days in the treatment of acute otitis media. A total of 575 patients were enrolled, and only the suspension formulations were used in this trial. Overall, the adverse reactions seen were comparable to that noted above; however, there were differences in the rates of diarrhea, skin rashes/urticaria, and diaper area rashes. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span></p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following have been identified during postmarketing use of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal:</span> Indigestion, gastritis, stomatitis, glossitis, black “hairy” tongue, mucocutaneous candidiasis, enterocolitis, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Hypersensitivity Reactions:</span> Pruritus, angioedema, serum sickness–like reactions (urticaria or skin rash accompanied by arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia, and frequently fever), erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, and cases of exfoliative dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Liver:</span> Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice, increases in serum transaminases (AST and/or ALT), serum bilirubin, and/or alkaline phosphatase, has been reported with amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium. It has been reported more commonly in the elderly, in males, or in patients on prolonged treatment. The histologic findings on liver biopsy have consisted of predominantly cholestatic, hepatocellular, or mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular changes. The onset of signs/symptoms of hepatic dysfunction may occur during or several weeks after therapy has been discontinued. The hepatic dysfunction, which may be severe, is usually reversible. Deaths have been reported. <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Renal:</span> Interstitial nephritis, hematuria, and crystalluria have been reported. <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Hemic and Lymphatic Systems:</span> Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Thrombocytosis was noted in less than 1% of the patients treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium. There have been reports of increased prothrombin time in patients receiving amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium and anticoagulant therapy concomitantly. <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Central Nervous System:</span> Agitation, anxiety, behavioral changes, confusion, convulsions, dizziness, insomnia, and reversible hyperactivity have been reported.</p><p><span class="Bold">Miscellaneous:</span> Tooth discoloration (brown, yellow, or gray staining) has been reported. Most reports occurred in pediatric patients. Discoloration was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Probenecid</h3><p class="First">Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin but does not delay renal excretion of clavulanic acid. Concurrent use with amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium may result in increased and prolonged blood concentrations of amoxicillin. Coadministration of probenecid is not recommended.</p><h3>Oral Anticoagulants</h3><p class="First">Abnormal prolongation of prothrombin time (increased international normalized ratio [INR]) has been reported in patients receiving amoxicillin and oral anticoagulants. Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concurrently with amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium. Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation.</p><h3>Allopurinol</h3><p class="First">The concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of amoxicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.</p><h3>Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First">Amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium may affect intestinal flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives.</p><h3>Effects on Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">High urine concentrations of amoxicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST<span class="Sup">®</span>, Benedict’s Solution, or Fehling’s Solution. Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions be used.</p><p>Following administration of amoxicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category B</span></p><p>Reproduction studies performed in pregnant rats and mice given amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (2:1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin:clavulanate) at oral doses up to 1200 mg/kg/day revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium. The amoxicillin doses in rats and mice (based on body surface area) were approximately 4 and 2 times the maximum recommended adult human oral dose (875 mg/125 mg every 12 hours). For clavulanate, these dose multiples were approximately 9 and 4 times the maximum recommended adult human oral dose (125 mg every 8 hours). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">Oral ampicillin-class antibiotics are poorly absorbed during labor. It is not known whether use of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood of the necessity for an obstetrical intervention.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Amoxicillin has been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (chewable) have been established in pediatric patients. Use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (chewable) in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from studies of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets in adults with additional data from a study of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension in pediatric patients aged 2 months to 12 years with acute otitis media. [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14.2)</span>]</p><p>Because of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed; clavulanate elimination is unaltered in this age group. Dosing of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (chewable) should be modified in pediatric patients aged &lt; 12 weeks (&lt; 3 months). [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span>]</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 3,119 patients in an analysis of clinical studies of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, 32% were ≥ 65 years old, and 14% were ≥ 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h3>Dosing in Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Amoxicillin is primarily eliminated by the kidney and dosage adjustment is usually required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR &lt; 30 mL/min). See <span class="Italics">Patients With Renal Impairment (2.3)</span> for specific recommendations in patients with renal impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures as required. A prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poison-control center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mg/kg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms<span class="Sup">1</span>.</p><p>Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in patients after overdosage with amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium.</p><p>Crystalluria, in some cases leading to renal failure, has also been reported after amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium overdosage in adult and pediatric patients. In case of overdosage, adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium crystalluria.</p><p>Renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration. High blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium. Amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium may be removed from circulation by hemodialysis.

Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam, structurally related to the penicillins, which possesses the ability to inactivate some beta-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. In particular, it has good activity against the clinically important plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance.</p><p>The formulation of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension, and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (chewable) protects amoxicillin from degradation by some beta-lactamase enzymes and extends the antibiotic spectrum of amoxicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to amoxicillin.</p><p>Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gram-Positive Bacteria</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Gram-Negative Bacteria</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Enterobacter</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Klebsiella</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</span></p><p>The following in vitro data are available, <span class="Bold">but their clinical significance is unknown</span>.

Only the suspension formulations were used in this trial. A total of 575 pediatric patients (aged 2 months to 12 years) were enrolled, with an even distribution among the 2 treatment groups and a comparable number of patients were evaluable (i.e., ≥ 84%) per treatment group. Otitis media-specific criteria were required for eligibility and a strong correlation was found at the end of therapy and follow-up between these criteria and physician assessment of clinical response. The clinical efficacy rates at the end of therapy visit (defined as 2 to 4 days after the completion of therapy) and at the follow-up visit (defined as 22 to 28 days post-completion of therapy) were comparable for the 2 treatment groups, with the following cure rates obtained for the evaluable patients: At end of therapy, 87% (n = 265) and 82% (n = 260) for 45 mg/kg/day every 12 hours and 40 mg/kg/day every 8 hours, respectively. At follow-up, 67% (n = 249) and 69% (n = 243) for 45 mg/kg/day every 12 hours and 40 mg/kg/day every 8 hours, respectively.</p><p>Diarrhea was defined as either: (a) 3 or more watery or 4 or more loose/watery stools in 1 day; OR (b) 2 watery stools per day or 3 loose/watery stools per day for 2 consecutive days. The incidence of diarrhea was significantly lower in patients who received the every 12 hours regimen compared to patients who received the every 8 hours regimen (14% and 34%, respectively). In addition, the number of patients with either severe diarrhea or who were withdrawn with diarrhea was significantly lower in the every 12 hours treatment group (3% and 8% for the every 12 hours/10 day and every 8 hours/10 day, respectively). In the every 12 hours treatment group, 3 patients (1%) were withdrawn with an allergic reaction, while 1 patient in the every 8 hours group was withdrawn for this reason. The number of patients with a candidal infection of the diaper area was 4% and 6% for the every 12 hours and every 8 hours groups, respectively.</p><p>It is not known if the finding of a statistically significant reduction in diarrhea with the oral suspensions dosed every 12 hours, versus suspensions dosed every 8 hours, can be extrapolated to the chewable tablets. The presence of mannitol in the chewable tablets may contribute to a different diarrhea profile. The every 12 hour oral suspensions (200 mg/25.8 mg per 5 mL and 400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL) are sweetened with aspartame.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets USP</span></p><p>Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets USP are supplied as follows:</p><p>500 mg/125 mg: White, oblong-shaped, biconvex, film-coated, unscored tablets, debossed 93 on one side and 2274 on the other side.

Each dose should be taken with a meal or snack to reduce the possibility of gastrointestinal upset.</p><p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension, and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (chewable), should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension, and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (chewable) are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension, and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (chewable) or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials, and it usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken their last dose of the antibacterial. If diarrhea is severe or lasts more than 2 or 3 days, patients should contact their physician.</p><p>Patients should be advised to keep suspension refrigerated. Shake well before using. When dosing a child with the suspension (liquid) of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, use a dosing spoon or medicine dropper. Be sure to rinse the spoon or dropper after each use. Bottles of suspension of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium may contain more liquid than required. Follow your doctor’s instructions about the amount to use and the days of treatment your child requires. Discard any unused medicine.</p><p>Patients should be aware that amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension, and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (chewable) contain a penicillin class drug product that can cause allergic reactions in some individuals.</p><p>All brand names listed are the registered trademarks of their respective owners and are not trademarks of Teva Pharmaceuticals USA.</p><p>Manufactured In Canada By:</p><p><span class="Bold">TEVA CANADA LIMITED</span></p><p>Toronto, Canada M1B 2K9</p><p>Manufactured For:</p><p><span class="Bold">TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA</span></p><p>Sellersville, PA 18960</p><p>Rev.
