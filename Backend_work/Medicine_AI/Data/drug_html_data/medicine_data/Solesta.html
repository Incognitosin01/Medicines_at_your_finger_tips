Solesta is given as a set of 4 injections directly into the tissues of your anal canal.</p><p>You will be given an enema to clean out your rectum just before Solesta is injected.</p><p>You will receive the injections while lying on your side. A small tube called an anoscope will be gently inserted just a few inches into your rectum. This will help the doctor determine where to properly place the needle when injecting Solesta. You will be made to feel as comfortable as possible while the medicine is injected.</p><p><b>Tell your caregivers if you feel severe pain during the injections.</b></p><p>You will be able to get up after your injections are completed. However, you should remain resting for about 60 minutes before leaving the clinic. Your caregivers will check you for any immediate side effects the injections may cause.</p><p>Do not take a hot bath or engage in physical activity during the first 24 hours after your injection procedure.</p><p>You may use a stool softener to make your first bowel movement more comfortable after treatment. Do not continue using the stool softener unless your doctor tells you to.</p><p>Solesta injections can cause rectal bleeding or a rectal infection. Call your doctor if rectal bleeding is heavy or you have severe rectal irritation or signs of infection (pain, warmth, swelling, itching, or drainage).</p><p>You be given antibiotic medication to help prevent infection. Use the antibiotic for the full prescribed length of time, even if you have no symptoms of infection.</p><p>Solesta is not effective in every person and you may continue to have fecal incontinence. It also may take 3 to 6 months before you notice the full effects of this medicine. Tell your doctor if your symptoms do not begin to improve after 1 month.</p><p>You may need to receive more than one treatment with Solesta.</p><p>It is not known whether this medicine will continue to be effective for longer than 12 months.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since  Solesta is given all at one time, it does not have a daily dosing schedule.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since Solesta is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving  Solesta?</h2><p>For at least 1 week after your injections, avoid all strenuous activity including sexual intercourse, jogging, horseback riding, bicycling, or vigorous exercise.</p><p>For at least 1 month after injection, avoid inserting anything into your rectum (such as suppository, enema, or rectal thermometer).</p><p>Do not use anti-diarrhea medicine for at least 1 week after treatment with Solesta.</p><p>Ask your doctor before taking any medication to treat pain or swelling caused by your injection procedure. Avoid taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), celecoxib (Celebrex), diclofenac, indomethacin, meloxicam, and others.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Solesta side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have any of these <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
