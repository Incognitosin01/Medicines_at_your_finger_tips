Total volume of liquid consumed with Dose 2: 2480 mL (~83 oz).</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Prior to administration, each component of the dosing regimen (oral solution and powder for oral solution) must be diluted with water as follows:</p><p>Oral solution: Further dilute the 6 ounce oral solution by pouring the entire contents of the bottle into the provided 16 ounce mixing container and filling that container with cool water to the fill line for a final volume of 16 ounces (480 mL). Following dilution, the oral solution should be consumed within 20 minutes.</p><p>Powder for oral solution: Dissolve the powder in the provided 2 L bottle by adding water to the fill line for a final volume of 2 L (2000 mL). Close tightly and shake the container until all powder is dissolved; solution should be clear and colorless. Flavor packs (provided with the product) may also be added if desired. Following reconstitution of the powder for oral solution, the solution may be refrigerated and should be used within 48 hours.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Oral: Each bottle must be diluted prior to use. The entire contents should be consumed followed by each postdose hydration amount, as directed depending on the regimen. Only clear liquids should be consumed from the start of the dosing regimen until 2 hours prior to colonoscopy; thereafter, nothing should be consumed until after colonoscopy. Patients should avoid solid foods, red and purple liquids, milk, and alcoholic beverages on the day prior and the day of the colonoscopy. Oral medications should not be administered within 1 hour of start of therapy.</p><h2>Dietary Considerations</h2><p>Patient should not eat solid food from start of solution administration until after colonoscopy. Patient may have clear liquids (no solid food or milk) until 2 hours prior to colonoscopy.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store unused kits at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). Keep out of reach of children. Following dilution, the oral solution should be consumed within 20 minutes. Following reconstitution of the powder for oral solution, the solution may be refrigerated and should be used within 48 hours.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>&gt;10%:</p><p>Central nervous system: Malaise (62% to 69%)</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Abdominal distension (52%), nausea (42% to 46%), abdominal pain (38% to 40%), vomiting (11% to 14%)</p><p>Hepatic: Increased serum bilirubin (8% to 11%)</p><p>Renal: Renal insufficiency (9% to 25%)</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Central nervous system: Headache (1% to 2%)</p><p>Endocrine &amp; metabolic: Acidosis (3% to 10%), hypercalcemia (4% to 9%), increased serum glucose (2% to 7%), hyperuricemia (4% to 6%), hypokalemia (4%), decreased serum bicarbonate (3% to 4%), increased urine osmolality (2% to 4%), hypophosphatemia (≤3%), hypochloremia (1%), hyponatremia (≤1%), decreased serum magnesium (≤1%)</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Increased creatine phosphokinase (7%)</p><p>Renal: Increased serum creatinine (1% to 2%)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Arrhythmias: Serious arrhythmias have occurred rarely with the use of osmotic laxative products; use caution in patients at increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias (eg, recent MI, uncontrolled arrhythmias, unstable angina, cardiomyopathy, history of prolonged QT, HF); consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in these patients.</p><p>• Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities: Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to arrhythmias, seizures, and renal impairment. Advise patients to maintain adequate hydration before, during, and after treatment. If patient becomes dehydrated or experiences significant vomiting after treatment, consider post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Instruct patients to avoid alcohol beginning the day before colonoscopy and until after the completion of the colonoscopy; alcohol consumption may increase risk of dehydration.</p><p>• GI effects: Osmotic laxatives may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, including cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concomitant use of stimulant laxatives and this preparation may increase the risk and should be avoided. Use caution when interpreting colonoscopy results in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease.</p><p>• Seizures: Seizures associated with electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hyponatremia, hypokalemia) and low serum osmolality have occurred; use with caution in patients with underlying electrolyte disturbances and in patients at increased risk for seizures (eg, concomitant medications that lower seizure threshold, withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Gout: May cause transient increases in uric acid; use caution in patients with gout.</p><p>• Impaired gag reflex: Observe unconscious or semiconscious patients with impaired gag reflex or those who are otherwise prone to regurgitation or aspiration during administration.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use caution in patients with renal impairment; adequate hydration is particularly important in these patients or in patients receiving concomitant medications that may affect renal function (eg, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, NSAIDs). Consider baseline and post-colonoscopy electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN levels in patients at increased risk for renal impairment.</p><p>• Ulcerative colitis: Use with caution in patients with severe, active ulcerative colitis; increased risk of exacerbation of ulcerative colitis with use.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Evaluate patients with symptoms of bowel obstruction/perforation (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or distension) prior to use. Each bottle must be diluted with water prior to use; inadvertent administration of undiluted solution may increase the risk of nausea, vomiting, and fluid/electrolyte abnormalities.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Consider baseline and postprocedure labwork (eg, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine) in patients at risk for renal impairment, seizure, or who have a history of electrolyte abnormality; post-colonoscopy labwork (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) is recommended in any patient experiencing significant vomiting or signs of dehydration following use. ECG (prior to therapy and post-colonoscopy) in patients with risks for prolonged QT or arrhythmias.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
