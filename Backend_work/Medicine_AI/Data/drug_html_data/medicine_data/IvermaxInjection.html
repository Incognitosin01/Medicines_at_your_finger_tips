1% Sterile Solution</p><p><span class="Bold">A Parasiticide for the Treatment and Control of Internal and External Parasites of Cattle and Swine.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Consult your veterinarian for assistance in the diagnosis, treatment and control of parasitism.</span></p><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2><p class="First">IVERMAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection for Cattle and Swine (ivermectin) is an injectable parasiticide for cattle and swine. One low-volume dose effectively treats and controls the following internal and external parasites that may impair the health of cattle and swine: gastrointestinal roundworms (including inhibited Ostertagia ostertagi in cattle), lungworms, grubs, sucking lice, and mange mites of cattle; and gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, lice, and mange mites of swine. Ivermectin's convenience, broad-spectrum efficacy and safety margin make IVERMAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection for Cattle and Swine a unique product for parasite control of cattle and swine.</p><h2>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">Ivermectin is derived from the avermectins, a family of potent, broad-spectrum antiparasitic agents isolated from fermentation of <span class="Italics">Streptomyces avermitilis</span>.</p><p>IVERMAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection for Cattle and Swine is a clear, ready-to-use, sterile solution containing 1% ivermectin, 40% glycerol formal, and propylene glycol q.s. ad 100%. IVERMAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection for Cattle and Swine is formulated to deliver the recommended dose level of 200 mcg ivermectin/kilogram of body weight in cattle when given subcutaneously at the rate of 1 mL/110 lb (50 kg). In Swine, IVERMAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection for Cattle and Swine is formulated to deliver the recommended dose level of 300 mcg ivermectin/kilogram body weight when given subcutaneously in the neck at the rate of 1 mL per 75 lb (33 kg).</p><h2>MODE OF ACTION</h2><p class="First">Ivermectin is a member of the macrocyclic lactone class of endectocides which have a unique mode of action. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).</p><p>The margin of safety for compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels, the macrocyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold Underline">Cattle:</span> IVERMAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection for Cattle and Swine is indicated for the effective treatment and control of the following harmful species of gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, grubs, sucking lice, and mange mites in cattle:</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Roundworms</span> (adults and fourth-stage larvae):</p><p><span class="Italics">Ostertagia ostertagi</span> (including inhibited <span class="Italics">O. ostertagi</span>)</p><p><span class="Italics">O. lyrata</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemonchus placei</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Trichostrongylus axei</span></p><p><span class="Italics">T. colubriformis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Cooperia oncophora</span></p><p><span class="Italics">C. punctata</span></p><p><span class="Italics">C. pectinata</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Oesophagostomum radiatum</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Bunostomum phlebotomum</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Nematodirus helvetianus</span> (adults only)</p><p><span class="Italics">N. spathiger</span> (adults only)</p><p><span class="Bold">Lungworms</span> (adults and fourth-stage larvae):</p><p><span class="Italics">Dictyocaulus viviparus</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Cattle Grubs</span> (parasitic stages):</p><p><span class="Italics">Hypoderma bovis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">H. lineatum</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Sucking Lice:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Linognathus vituli</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haematopinus eurysternus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Solenopotes capillatus</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Mites</span> (scabies):</p><p><span class="Italics">Psoroptes ovis</span> (syn. <span class="Italics">P. communis</span> var. <span class="Italics">bovis</span>)</p><p><span class="Italics">Sarcoptes scabiei</span> var. <span class="Italics">bovis</span></p><h3>Persistent Activity</h3><p class="First">Ivermectin injection has been proved to effectively control infections and to protect cattle from reinfection with <span class="Italics">Dictyocaulus viviparus</span> and <span class="Italics">Oesophagostomum radiatum</span> for 28 days after treatment; <span class="Italics">Ostertagia ostertagi</span>, <span class="Italics">Trichostrongylus axei</span> and <span class="Italics">Cooperia punctata</span> for 21 days after treatment; <span class="Italics">Haemonchus placei</span> and <span class="Italics">Cooperia oncophora</span> for 14 days after treatment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Underline">Swine:</span> IVERMAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection for Cattle and Swine is indicated for the effective treatment and control of the following harmful species of gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, lice, and mange mites in swine:</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Roundworms:</span></p><p>Large roundworm, <span class="Italics">Ascaris suum</span></p><p>(adults and fourth-stage larvae)</p><p>Red stomach worm, <span class="Italics">Hyostrongylus rubidus</span></p><p>(adults and fourth-stage larvae)</p><p>Nodular worm, <span class="Italics">Oesophagostomum</span> spp.</p><p>(adults and fourth-stage larvae)</p><p>Threadworm, <span class="Italics">Strongyloides ransomi</span> (adults)</p><p><span class="Bold">Somatic Roundworm Larvae:</span></p><p>Threadworm, <span class="Italics">Strongyloides ransomi</span> (somatic larvae)</p><p>Sows must be treated at least seven days before farrowing to prevent infection in piglets.</p><p><span class="Bold">Lungworms:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metastrongylus</span> spp. (adults)</p><p><span class="Bold">Lice:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haematopinus suis</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Mange Mites:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Sarcoptes scabiei</span> var. <span class="Italics">suis</span></p><h2>DOSAGE</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold Underline">Cattle:</span> IVERMAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection for Cattle and Swine should be given only by subcutaneous injection under the loose skin in front of or behind the shoulder at the recommended dose level of 200 mcg of ivermectin per kilogram of body weight.

As with any injection, sterile equipment should be used. The injection site should be cleaned and disinfected with alcohol before injection. The rubber stopper should also be disinfected with alcohol to prevent contamination of the contents. Mild and transient pain reactions may be seen in some swine following subcutaneous administration.</p><h3>Recommended Treatment Program</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Underline">Swine:</span> At the time of initiating any parasite control program, it is important to treat all breeding animals in the herd. After the initial treatment, use IVERMAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection for Cattle and Swine regularly as follows:</p><h3>BREEDING ANIMALS</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Sows:</span> Treat prior to farrowing, preferably 7-14 days before, to minimize infection of piglets.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gilts:</span>   Treat 7-14 days prior to breeding.<br/>
                  Treat 7-14 days prior to farrowing.</p><p><span class="Bold">Boars:</span> Frequency and need for treatments are dependent upon exposure.<br/>
                   Treat at least two times a year.</p><h3>FEEDER PIGS</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(Weaners/Growers/Finishers)</span></p><p>All weaner/feeder pigs should be treated before placement in clean quarters. Pigs exposed to contaminated soil or pasture may need retreatment if reinfection occurs.</p><p><span class="Bold">NOTE:</span></p><h3>Special Minor Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Underline">Reindeer:</span> For the treatment and control of warbles (<span class="Italics">Oedemagena tarandi</span>) in reindeer, inject 200 micrograms ivermectin per kilogram of body weight, subcutaneously. Follow use directions for cattle as described under <span class="Bold">ADMINISTRATION.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Underline">American Bison:</span> For the treatment and control of grubs (<span class="Italics">Hypoderma bovis</span>) in American bison, inject 200 micrograms ivermectin per kilogram of body weight, subcutaneously. Follow use directions for cattle as described under <span class="Bold">ADMINISTRATION.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">RESIDUE INFORMATION:</span> Do not treat reindeer or American bison within 8 weeks (56 days) of slaughter.</p><h2>WARNING</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NOT FOR USE IN HUMANS.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children.</span></p><p>The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) contains more detailed occupational safety information. To report adverse effects, obtain an MSDS or for assistance, call ChemTrec at 1-800-424-9300.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">RESIDUE INFORMATION:</span> Do not treat cattle within 35 days of slaughter. Because a withdrawal time in milk has not been established, do not use in female dairy cattle of breeding age. A withdrawal period has not been established for this product in pre-ruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal. Do not treat swine within 18 days of slaughter.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS</h2><p class="First">Transitory discomfort has been observed in some cattle following subcutaneous administration. A low incidence of soft tissue swelling at the injection site has been observed. These reactions have disappeared without treatment. For cattle, divide doses greater than 10 mL between two injection sites to reduce occasional discomfort or site reaction.</p><p>Use sterile equipment and sanitize the injection site by applying a suitable disinfectant. Clean, properly disinfected needles should be used to reduce the potential for injection site infections.</p><p>Observe cattle for injection site reactions. Reactions may be due to clostridial infection and should be aggressively treated with appropriate antibiotics. If injection site infections are suspected, consult your veterinarian.</p><p>This product is not for intravenous or intramuscular use.<br/>
Protect product from light.</p><p>IVERMAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection for Cattle and Swine has been developed specifically for use in cattle, swine, reindeer, and American bison <span class="Bold">only</span>. This product should not be used in other animal species as severe adverse reactions, including fatalities in dogs, may result.</p><h3>When to Treat Cattle with Grubs</h3><p class="First">IVERMAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection for Cattle and Swine effectively controls all stages of cattle grubs. However, proper timing of treatment is important. For most effective results, cattle should be treated as soon as possible after the end of the heel fly (warble fly) season. Destruction of <span class="Italics">Hypoderma</span> larvae (cattle grubs) at the period when these grubs are in vital areas may cause undesirable host-parasite reactions including the possibility of fatalities. Killing <span class="Italics">Hypoderma lineatum</span> when it is in the tissue surrounding the esophagus (gullet) may cause salivation and bloat; killing <span class="Italics">H. bovis</span> when it is in the vertebral canal may cause staggering or paralysis. These reactions are not specific to treatment with IVERMAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection for Cattle and Swine, but can occur with any successful treatment of grubs. Cattle should be treated either before or after these stages of grub development. Consult your veterinarian concerning the proper time for treatment.</p><p>Cattle treated with IVERMAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection for Cattle and Swine after the end of the heel fly season may be retreated with IVERMAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection for Cattle and Swine during the winter for internal parasites, mange mites, or sucking lice without danger of grub-related reactions. A planned parasite control program is recommended.</p><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Store at 15°- 30°C (59°- 86°F).</p><h2>ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY</h2><p class="First">Studies indicate that when ivermectin comes in contact with soil, it readily and tightly binds to the soil and becomes inactive over time. Free ivermectin may adversely affect fish and certain aquatic organisms. Do not permit water runoff from feedlots to enter lakes, streams, or ponds. Do not contaminate water by direct application or by improper disposal of drug containers. Dispose of containers in an approved landfill or by incineration.</p><p>As with other avermectins, ivermectin is excreted in the dung of treated animals and can inhibit the reproduction and growth of pest and beneficial insects that use dung as a source of food and for reproduction. The magnitude and duration of such effects are species and life-cycle specific. When used according to label directions, the product is not expected to have an adverse impact on populations of dung-dependent insects.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED</h2><p class="First">IVERMAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Injection for Cattle and Swine is available in five ready-to-use pack sizes:</p><p>The 50 mL pack is a multiple-dose, rubber-capped bottle.
