This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For inotersen, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to inotersen or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of inotersen injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of inotersen injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have serious unwanted effects (including heart failure, chills, myalgia, or pain in the arms or legs), which may require caution in patients receiving inotersen.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking inotersen, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using inotersen with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of inotersen</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you inotersen. It is given as a shot under your skin, usually in the stomach, thighs, or upper arms. You or your caregiver may be trained to prepare and inject the medicine at home. Be sure that you understand how to use the medicine.</p><p>If you use inotersen at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections. Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, red, bruised, or hard, or with scars or tattoos.</p><p>It is very important that you understand the requirements of the Tegsedi™ REMS program, and become familiar with the Tegsedi™ Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions. Ask your pharmacist for the medication guide if you do not have one.</p><p>Allow the medicine to warm to room temperature for 30 minutes before you use it. Do not warm it in any other way.</p><p>Check the liquid in the prefilled syringe or autoinjector. It should be colorless or slightly yellow. Do not use the medicine if the liquid is cloudy, discolored, or has particles in it. Do not shake.</p><p>Do not remove the needle cap from the prefilled syringe until you are ready to use it.</p><p>You might not use all of the medicine in each prefilled syringe. Use each prefilled syringe only one time. Do not save an open syringe.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of inotersen will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of inotersen. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.

Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Inotersen injection will lower the number of some types of blood cells in your body. Because of this, you may bleed or get infections more easily. To help with these problems, avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have bloody urine, a decrease in frequency or amount of urine, an increase in blood pressure, increased thirst, loss of appetite, lower back or side pain, nausea, swelling of the face, fingers, or lower legs, troubled breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, vomiting, or weight gain. These could be symptoms of a serious kidney problem.</p><p>Inotersen may increase your risk for inflammatory or immune system problems, stroke, or arterial dissection (tear in the lining of a brain artery). Check with your doctor if you have confusion, difficulty in speaking, slow speech, inability to speak, inability to move the arms, legs, or facial muscles, double vision, headache, spasms in the legs, back pain, or weight loss.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.</p><p>Inotersen may cause serious allergic reactions, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after using inotersen.</p><p>Inotersen may decrease the vitamin A levels in the blood. Check with your doctor right away if blurred vision, difficulty with reading, difficulty seeing at night, or any other change in vision occurs during or after treatment. Your doctor may want your eyes be checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Inotersen side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
