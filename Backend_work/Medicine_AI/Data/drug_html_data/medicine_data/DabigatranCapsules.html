(A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE CAPSULES INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS<br/>
Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5, 2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span><br/>
<br/>
(B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA<br/>
Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">• use of indwelling epidural catheters<br/>
• concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants<br/>
• a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures<br/>
• a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery<br/>
• optimal timing between the administration of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules and neuraxial procedures is not known <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span><br/>
Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].<br/></span> Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Dabigatran Capsules</h2><h3>Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation</h3><p class="First">Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.</p><h3>Treatment of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism</h3><p class="First">Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules is indicated for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients who have been treated with a parenteral anticoagulant for 5-10 days.</p><h3>Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism</h3><p class="First">Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients who have been previously treated.</p><h3>Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Following Hip Replacement Surgery</h3><p class="First">Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules is indicated for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, in patients who have undergone hip replacement surgery.</p><h2>Dabigatran Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dose</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><br/>

Periodically assess renal function as clinically indicated (i.e., more frequently in clinical situations that may be associated with a decline in renal function) and adjust therapy accordingly. Discontinue Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules in patients who develop acute renal failure while on Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules and consider alternative anticoagulant therapy.</p><p>Generally, the extent of anticoagulation does not need to be assessed.

Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules should be taken with a full glass of water. Breaking, chewing, or emptying the contents of the capsule can result in increased exposure <span class="Italics">[</span>s<span class="Italics">ee Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>If a dose of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day; the missed dose should be skipped if it cannot be taken at least 6 hours before the next scheduled dose. The dose of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.</p><h3>Converting from or to Warfarin</h3><p class="First">When converting patients from warfarin therapy to Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules, discontinue warfarin and start Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules when the INR is below 2.0.</p><p>When converting from Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules to warfarin, adjust the starting time of warfarin based on creatinine clearance as follows:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>For CrCl ≥50 mL/min, start warfarin 3 days before discontinuing Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules.</li>
<li>For CrCl 30-50 mL/min, start warfarin 2 days before discontinuing Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules.</li>
<li>For CrCl 15-30 mL/min, start warfarin 1 day before discontinuing Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules.</li>
<li>For CrCl &lt;15 mL/min, no recommendations can be made.</li>
</ul><p>Because Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules can increase INR, the INR will better reflect warfarin’s effect only after Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules has been stopped for at least 2 days <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><h3>Converting from or to Parenteral Anticoagulants</h3><p class="First">For patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, start Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of the parenteral drug was to have been administered or at the time of discontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral drug (e.g., intravenous unfractionated heparin).</p><p>For patients currently taking Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules, wait 12 hours (CrCl ≥30 mL/min) or 24 hours (CrCl &lt;30 mL/min) after the last dose of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules before initiating treatment with a parenteral anticoagulant <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Discontinuation for Surgery and Other Interventions</h3><p class="First">If possible, discontinue Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 1 to 2 days (CrCl ≥50 mL/min) or 3 to 5 days (CrCl &lt;50 mL/min) before invasive or surgical procedures because of the increased risk of bleeding. Consider longer times for patients undergoing major surgery, spinal puncture, or placement of a spinal or epidural catheter or port, in whom complete hemostasis may be required <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>If surgery cannot be delayed, there is an increased risk of bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)]</span>. Use a specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) in case of emergency surgery or urgent procedures when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is needed. Refer to the idarucizumab prescribing information for additional information. Restart Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules as soon as medically appropriate.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">150 mg capsules with a white to pale yellow pellets filled in HPMC capsule size “0EL” light navy blue opaque body and light cream opaque cap imprinted with “150” on body and “DAB” on cap in black ink.</p><p>75 mg capsules with a white to pale yellow pellets filled in HPMC capsule size “1” light cream opaque cap and light cream opaque body imprinted with “DAB” on cap and “75” on body in black ink.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules is contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation</h3><p class="First">Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. If Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant and restart Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules as soon as medically appropriate <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5, 2.6)].</span></p><h3>Risk of Bleeding</h3><p class="First">Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules increases the risk of bleeding and can cause significant and, sometimes, fatal bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss (e.g., a drop in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit or hypotension). Discontinue Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules in patients with active pathological bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span></p><p>Risk factors for bleeding include the concomitant use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anti-platelet agents, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs). Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules’s anticoagulant activity and half-life are increased in patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect:</span></p><p>A specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) for dabigatran is available when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is needed:</p><p>· For emergency surgery/urgent procedures</p><p>· In life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding</p><p>Hemodialysis can remove dabigatran; however the clinical experience supporting the use of hemodialysis as a treatment for bleeding is limited <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>. Prothrombin complex concentrates, or recombinant Factor VIIa may be considered but their use has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran. Consider administration of platelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long-acting antiplatelet drugs have been used.</p><h3>Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture</h3><p class="First">When neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal puncture is employed, patients treated with anticoagulant agents are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning]</span>.</p><p>To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of dabigatran and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.</p><p>Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, monitor frequently to detect any signs or symptoms of neurological impairment, such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to immediately report if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.</p><h3>Thromboembolic and Bleeding Events in Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules in patients with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic heart valves was evaluated in the RE-ALIGN trial, in which patients with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic heart valves (recently implanted or implanted more than three months prior to enrollment) were randomized to dose adjusted warfarin or 150 mg, 220 mg, or 300 mg of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules twice a day. RE-ALIGN was terminated early due to the occurrence of significantly more thromboembolic events (valve thrombosis, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and myocardial infarction) and an excess of major bleeding (predominantly post-operative pericardial effusions requiring intervention for hemodynamic compromise) in the Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules treatment arm as compared to the warfarin treatment arm. These bleeding and thromboembolic events were seen both in patients who were initiated on Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules post-operatively within three days of mechanical bileaflet valve implantation, as well as in patients whose valves had been implanted more than three months prior to enrollment. Therefore, the use of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules is contraindicated in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><p>The use of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules for the prophylaxis of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation in the setting of other forms of valvular heart disease, including the presence of a bioprosthetic heart valve, has not been studied and is not recommended.</p><h3>Effect of P-gp Inducers and Inhibitors on Dabigatran Exposure</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin) reduces exposure to dabigatran and should generally be avoided <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>P-gp inhibition and impaired renal function are the major independent factors that result in increased exposure to dabigatran <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> Concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors in patients with renal impairment is expected to produce increased exposure of  dabigatran compared to that seen with either factor alone.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation</span></span></p><p>Reduce the dose of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules to 75 mg twice daily when dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole is coadministered with Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-50 mL/min). Avoid use of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules and P-gp inhibitors in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15-30 mL/min) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Treatment and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism</span></span> Avoid use of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules and concomitant P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl &lt;50 mL/min <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Following Hip Replacement Surgery</span></span> <span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>Avoid use of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules and concomitant P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl &lt;50 mL/min <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple-Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS (especially those who are triple-positive [positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies]), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><p>· Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></p><p>· Risk of Bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></p><p>· Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></p><p>· Thromboembolic and Bleeding Events in Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></p><p> · Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple-Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span></p><p>The most serious adverse reactions reported with Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules were related to bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First"> Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation </span></span></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"> </span></span></p><p>The RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant Therapy) study provided safety information on the use of two doses of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules and warfarin <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)].</span> The numbers of patients and their exposures are described in Table 1.

There was a higher rate of any gastrointestinal bleeds in patients receiving Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 150 mg than in patients receiving warfarin (6.6% vs. 4.2%, respectively). The risk of major bleeds was similar with Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 150 mg and warfarin across major subgroups defined by baseline characteristics (see Figure 1), with the exception of age, where there was a trend towards a higher incidence of major bleeding on Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules (hazard ratio 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0 to 1.5) for patients ≥75 years of age.<br/>

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions</span></span><br/>
Patients on Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 150 mg had an increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions (35% vs. 24% on warfarin). These were commonly dyspepsia (including abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort) and gastritis-like symptoms (including GERD, esophagitis, erosive gastritis, gastric hemorrhage, hemorrhagic gastritis, hemorrhagic erosive gastritis, and gastrointestinal ulcer).<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><br/>
Hypersensitivity Reactions</span></span><br/>
In the RE-LY study, drug hypersensitivity (including urticaria, rash, and pruritus), allergic edema, anaphylactic reaction, and anaphylactic shock were reported in &lt;0.1% of patients receiving Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Treatment and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism</span></span><br/>
Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules was studied in 4387 patients in 4 pivotal, parallel, randomized, double-blind trials. Three of these trials were active-controlled (warfarin) (RE-COVER, RE-COVER II, and RE-MEDY), and one study (RE-SONATE) was placebo-controlled. The demographic characteristics were similar among the 4 pivotal studies and between the treatment groups within these studies. Approximately 60% of the treated patients were male, with a mean age of 55.1 years. The majority of the patients were white (87.7%), 10.3% were Asian, and 1.9% were black with a mean CrCl of 105.6 mL/min.<br/>
Bleeding events for the 4 pivotal studies were classified as major bleeding events if at least one of the following criteria applied: fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ (intraocular, intracranial, intraspinal or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal bleeding, intra-articular bleeding, or pericardial bleeding), bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 2.0 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L or more, or leading to transfusion of 2 or more units of whole blood or red cells).<br/>
<br/>
RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies compared Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 150 mg twice daily and warfarin for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Patients received 5-10 days of an approved parenteral anticoagulant therapy followed by 6 months, with mean exposure of 164 days, of oral only treatment; warfarin was overlapped with parenteral therapy.

In the RE-SONATE study, the rate of any gastrointestinal bleeds in patients receiving Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 150 mg was 0.7% (0.3% on placebo).<br/>
<br/>
Clinical Myocardial Infarction Events<br/>
In the active-controlled VTE studies, a higher rate of clinical myocardial infarction was reported in patients who received Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules [20 (0.66 per 100 patient-years)] than in those who received warfarin [5 (0.17 per 100 patient-years)]. In the placebo-controlled study, a similar rate of non-fatal and fatal clinical myocardial infarction was reported in patients who received Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules [1 (0.32 per 100 patient-years)] and in those who received placebo [1 (0.34 per 100 patient-years)].<br/>
<br/>
Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions<br/>
In the four pivotal studies, patients on Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 150 mg had a similar incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions (24.7% vs. 22.7% on warfarin). Dyspepsia (including abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort) occurred in patients on Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules in 7.5% vs. 5.5% on warfarin, and gastritis-like symptoms (including gastritis, GERD, esophagitis, erosive gastritis and gastric hemorrhage) occurred at 3.0% vs. 1.7%, respectively.<br/>
Hypersensitivity Reactions<br/>
In the 4 pivotal studies, drug hypersensitivity (including urticaria, rash, and pruritus), allergic edema, anaphylactic reaction, and anaphylactic shock were reported in 0.1% of patients receiving Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules.<br/>
Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Following Hip Replacement Surgery<br/>
Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules was studied in 5476 patients, randomized and treated in two double-blind, active-controlled non-inferiority trials (RE-NOVATE and RE-NOVATE II). The demographic characteristics were similar across the two studies and between the treatment groups within these studies. Approximately 45.3 % of the treated patients were male, with a mean age of 63.2 years. The majority of the patients were white (96.1%), 3.6% were Asian, and 0.3% were black with a mean CrCl of 92 mL/min.<br/>
<br/>
Bleeding events for the RE-NOVATE and RE-NOVATE II studies were classified as major bleeding events if at least one of the following criteria applied: fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ (intraocular, intracranial, intraspinal or retroperitoneal bleeding), bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 2.0 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L) or more, or leading to transfusion of 2 or more units of whole blood or red cells, requiring treatment cessation or leading to re-operation.<br/>
<br/>
The RE-NOVATE study compared Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 75 mg taken orally 1-4 hours after surgery followed by 150 mg once daily, Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 110 mg taken orally 1-4 hours after surgery followed by 220 mg once daily and subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily initiated the evening before surgery for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients who had undergone hip replacement surgery. The RE-NOVATE II study compared Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 110 mg taken orally 1-4 hours after surgery followed by 220 mg once daily and subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily initiated the evening before surgery for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients who had undergone hip replacement surgery. In the RE-NOVATE and RE-NOVATE II studies, patients received 28-35 days of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules or enoxaparin with median exposure of 33 days.

The structural formula is:</p><p> <br/>
<br/>
Dabigatran etexilate mesylate is a white to pale yellow powder. A saturated solution in pure water has a solubility of 1.8 mg/mL. It is freely soluble in methanol, slightly soluble in ethanol, and sparingly soluble in isopropanol. <br/>
Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules are supplied in 75 mg and 150 mg strengths for oral administration. Each capsule contains dabigatran etexilate mesylate as the active ingredient: 150 mg dabigatran etexilate (equivalent to 172.95 mg dabigatran etexilate mesylate), or 75 mg dabigatran etexilate (equivalent to 86.48 mg dabigatran etexilate mesylate) along with the following inactive ingredients: Butylated hydroxy toluene, citric acid monohydrate crystal, hydroxy propyl cellulose, hypromellose, hypromellose phthalate, macrogol, methacrylic acid copolymer, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol 600, polyvinyl alcohol, povidone (k-value-25), sodium bicarbonate, talc, tartaric acid and titanium dioxide. The capsule shell is composed of hypromellose, titanium dioxide, D&amp;C red #33 &amp; FD&amp;C blue #1 (150 mg), FD&amp;C yellow #6 (75 mg and 150 mg). The imprinting ink contains shellac, propylene glycol, strong ammonia solution, black iron oxide &amp; potassium hydroxide.</p><h2>Dabigatran Capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Dabigatran and its acyl glucuronides are competitive, direct thrombin inhibitors. Because thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the coagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of a thrombus. Both free and clot-bound thrombin, and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation are inhibited by the active moieties.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">At recommended therapeutic doses, dabigatran etexilate prolongs the coagulation markers such as aPTT, ECT, and TT. INR is relatively insensitive to the exposure to dabigatran and cannot be interpreted the same way as used for warfarin monitoring.</p><p>The aPTT test provides an approximation of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules’s anticoagulant effect. The average time course for effects on aPTT, following approved dosing regimens in patients with various degrees of renal impairment is shown in Figure 2. The curves represent mean levels without confidence intervals; variations should be expected when measuring aPTT. While advice cannot be provided on the level of recovery of aPTT needed in any particular clinical setting, the curves can be used to estimate the time to get to a particular level of recovery, even when the time since the last dose of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules is not precisely known. In the RE-LY trial, the median (10<span class="Sup">th</span> to 90<span class="Sup">th</span> percentile) trough aPTT in patients receiving the 150 mg dose was 52 (40 to 76) seconds.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2 Average Time Course for Effects of Dabigatran on aPTT, Following Approved Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules Dosing Regimens in Patients with Various Degrees of Renal Impairment*<br/></span></p><p>*Simulations based on PK data from a study in subjects with renal impairment and PK/aPTT relationships derived from the RE-LY study; aPTT prolongation in RE-LY was measured centrally in citrate plasma using PTT Reagent Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany. There may be quantitative differences between various established methods for aPTT assessment.</p><p>The degree of anticoagulant activity can also be assessed by the ecarin clotting time (ECT). This test is a more specific measure of the effect of dabigatran than activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). In the RE-LY trial, the median (10<span class="Sup">th</span> to 90<span class="Sup">th</span> percentile) trough ECT in patients receiving the 150 mg dose was 63 (44 to 103) seconds.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>In orthopedic hip surgery patients, maximum aPTT response (Emax) to dabigatran and baseline aPTT were higher shortly after surgery than at later time points (e.g. ≥3 days after surgery). </p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></span></p><p>No prolongation of the QTc interval was observed with dabigatran etexilate at doses up to 600 mg.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Dabigatran etexilate mesylate is absorbed as the dabigatran etexilate ester. The ester is then hydrolyzed, forming dabigatran, the active moiety. Dabigatran is metabolized to four different acyl glucuronides and both the glucuronides and dabigatran have similar pharmacological activity. Pharmacokinetics described here refer to the sum of dabigatran and its glucuronides. Dabigatran displays dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and patients in the range of doses from 10 to 400 mg.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Absorption</span><br/>
The absolute bioavailability of dabigatran following oral administration of dabigatran etexilate is approximately 3 to 7%. Dabigatran etexilate is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-gp. After oral administration of dabigatran etexilate in healthy volunteers, Cmax occurs at 1 hour post-administration in the fasted state. Coadministration of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules with a high-fat meal delays the time to Cmax by approximately 2 hours but has no effect on the bioavailability of dabigatran; Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules may be administered with or without food.<br/>
The oral bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate increases by 75% when the pellets are taken without the capsule shell compared to the intact capsule formulation. Dabigatran Etexilate capsules should therefore not be broken, chewed, or opened before administration.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Distribution</span><br/>
Dabigatran is approximately 35% bound to human plasma proteins. The red blood cell to plasma partitioning of dabigatran measured as total radioactivity is less than 0.3. The volume of distribution of dabigatran is 50 to 70 L. Dabigatran pharmacokinetics are dose proportional after single doses of 10 to 400 mg. Given twice daily, dabigatran’s accumulation factor is approximately two.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Elimination</span><br/>
Dabigatran is eliminated primarily in the urine. Renal clearance of dabigatran is 80% of total clearance after intravenous administration. After oral administration of radiolabeled dabigatran, 7% of radioactivity is recovered in urine and 86% in feces. The half-life of dabigatran in healthy subjects is 12 to 17 hours.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Metabolism</span><br/>
After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is converted to dabigatran. The cleavage of the dabigatran etexilate by esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis to the active principal dabigatran is the predominant metabolic reaction. Dabigatran is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of CYP450 enzymes. Dabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically active acyl glucuronides. Four positional isomers, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O, and 4-O-acylglucuronide exist, and each accounts for less than 10% of total dabigatran in plasma.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span><br/>
An open, parallel-group single-center study compared dabigatran pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and patients with mild to moderate renal impairment receiving a single dose of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 150 mg. Exposure to dabigatran increases with severity of renal function impairment (Table 8). Similar findings were observed in the RE-LY, RE-COVER and RE-NOVATE II trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 8 Impact of Renal Impairment on Dabigatran Pharmacokinetics<br/></span></p><p>+Patients with severe renal impairment were not studied in RE-LY, RE-COVER and RE-NOVATE II.

The highest doses tested (200 mg/kg/day) in mice and rats were approximately 3.6 and 6 times, respectively, the human exposure at MRHD of 300 mg/day based on AUC comparisons.</p><p>Dabigatran was not mutagenic in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> tests, including bacterial reversion tests, mouse lymphoma assay and chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes, and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus assay in rats.</p><p>In the rat fertility study with oral gavage doses of 15, 70, and 200 mg/kg, males were treated for 29 days prior to mating, during mating up to scheduled termination, and females were treated 15 days prior to mating through gestation Day 6. No adverse effects on male or female fertility were observed at 200 mg/kg or 9 to 12 times the human exposure at MRHD of 300 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. However, the number of implantations decreased in females receiving 70 mg/kg, or 3 times the human exposure at MRHD based on AUC comparisons.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation</h3><p class="First">The clinical evidence for the efficacy of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules was derived from RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant Therapy), a multi-center, multi-national, randomized parallel group trial comparing two blinded doses of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules (110 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice daily) with open-label warfarin (dosed to target INR of 2 to 3) in patients with non-valvular, persistent, paroxysmal, or permanent atrial fibrillation and one or more of the following additional risk factors:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Previous stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism</li>
<li>Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40%</li>
<li>Symptomatic heart failure, ≥ New York Heart Association Class 2</li>
<li>Age ≥75 years</li>
<li>Age ≥65 years and one of the following: diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), or hypertension</li>
</ul><p>The primary objective of this study was to determine if  Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules was non-inferior to warfarin in reducing the occurrence of the composite endpoint, stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism. The study was designed to ensure that Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules preserved more than 50% of warfarin’s effect as established by previous randomized, placebo-controlled trials of warfarin in atrial fibrillation. Statistical superiority was also analyzed.</p><p>A total of 18,113 patients were randomized and followed for a median of 2 years. The patients’ mean age was 71.5 years and the mean CHADS2 score was 2.1. The patient population was 64% male, 70% Caucasian, 16% Asian, and 1% black. Twenty percent of patients had a history of a stroke or TIA and 50% were Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) naïve, defined as less than 2 months total lifetime exposure to a VKA. Thirty-two percent of the population had never been exposed to a VKA. Concomitant diseases of patients in this trial included hypertension 79%, diabetes 23%, and CAD 28%. At baseline, 40% of patients were on aspirin and 6% were on clopidogrel. For patients randomized to warfarin, the mean percentage of time in therapeutic range (INR 2 to 3) was 64%.</p><p>Relative to warfarin and to Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 110 mg twice daily, Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 150 mg twice daily significantly reduced the primary composite endpoint of stroke and systemic embolism (see Table 9 and Figure 4).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 9 First Occurrence of Stroke or Systemic Embolism in the RE-LY Study*<br/></span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span> </p><p>* Randomized ITT </p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 4 Kaplan-Meier Curve Estimate of Time to First Stroke or Systemic Embolism<br/>
<br/></span></p><p>The contributions of the components of the composite endpoint, including stroke by subtype, are shown in Table 10. The treatment effect was primarily a reduction in stroke. Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 150 mg twice daily was superior in reducing ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes relative to warfarin.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Table 10 Strokes and Systemic Embolism in the RE-LY Study<br/></span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span> </p><p>In the RE-LY trial, the rate of all-cause mortality was lower on dabigatran 150 mg than on warfarin (3.6% per year versus 4.1% per year). The rate of vascular death was lower on dabigatran 150 mg compared to warfarin (2.3% per year versus 2.7% per year). Non-vascular death rates were similar in the treatment arms.  </p><p>The efficacy of Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 150 mg twice daily was generally consistent across major subgroups (see Figure 5).<br/>
