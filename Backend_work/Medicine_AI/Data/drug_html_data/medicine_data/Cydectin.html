Moxidectin is an endectocide in the milbemycin chemical class which shares the distinctive mode of action characteristic of macrocyclic lactones. Cydectin Injectable is specially formulated to allow moxidectin to be absorbed from the site of injection and distributed internally to the areas of the body affected by endo- and/or ectoparasitism. Moxidectin binds selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which are critical to the function of invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This interferes with neurotransmission resulting in paralysis and elimination of the parasite.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Cydectin Injectable, when administered at the recommended dose level of 0.2 mg/2.2 lb (0.2 mg/kg) body weight, is effective in the treatment and control of the following internal and external parasites of cattle:</p><p><span class="Bold">Persistent Activity:</span> Cydectin Injectable has been proven to effectively protect cattle from reinfection with <span class="Italics">Dictyocaulus viviparus</span> and <span class="Italics">Oesophagostomum radiatum</span> for 42 days after treatment<span class="Italics">, Haemonchus placei</span> for 35 days after treatment, and <span class="Italics">Ostertagia ostertagi</span> and <span class="Italics">Trichostrongylus axei</span> for 14 days after treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Management Considerations for External Parasites: </span>For most effective external parasite control, Cydectin Injectable should be administered to all cattle in the herd. Cattle entering the herd following this administration should be treated prior to introduction. Consult your veterinarian or a livestock entomologist for the most appropriate time to administer Cydectin Injectable in your location to effectively control external parasites.</p><h2>DOSAGE</h2><p class="First">The recommended rate of administration for Cydectin Injectable is 1 mL for each 110 lb (50 kg) body weight to provide 0.2 mg moxidectin/2.2 lb (0.2 mg/kg) body weight. The table below will assist in the calculation of the appropriate volume of injectable which must be administered based on the weight of animal being treated. Be careful not to overdose animals; estimate animal’s body weight as closely as possible or weigh animals individually.</p><h2>ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">Cydectin Injectable should be administered by subcutaneous injection under the loose skin in front of or behind the shoulder (Figure 1). Needles 1/2 to 3/4 inch in length and 16 to 18 gauge are recommended for subcutaneous injections. Use sterile, dry equipment and aseptic procedures when withdrawing and administering Cydectin.</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Figure 1.

Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children.</span> To obtain a copy of the material safety data sheet (MSDS) which provides more detailed occupational safety information or to report adverse reactions attributable to exposure to this product, call 1-866-638-2226.</p><h2>RESIDUE WARNINGS</h2><p class="First">Cattle must not be slaughtered for human consumption within 21 days of treatment. Because a withholding time in milk has not been established for this product, do not use in female dairy cattle of breeding age. A withdrawal period has not been established for preruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.</p><h2>ANIMAL SAFETY WARNINGS</h2><p class="First">Do not use in sick, debilitated, or underweight animals. In foreign countries there have been reports of adverse effects, including death. This product should not be used in calves less than 8 weeks of age because safety testing has not been done in the U.S. in calves less than 8 weeks of age.</p><h2>ENVIRONMENTAL WARNINGS</h2><p class="First">Studies indicate that when moxidectin comes in contact with the soil, it readily and tightly binds to the soil and becomes inactive. Free moxidectin may adversely affect fish and certain aquatic organisms. Do not contaminate water by direct application or by improper disposal of drug containers.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Cydectin Injectable has been formulated specifically for subcutaneous injection in cattle and should not be given by other routes of administration. Subcutaneous injection can cause transient local tissue reaction that may result in trim loss of edible tissue at slaughter if animals are slaughtered within 35 days after treatment. This product should not be used in other animal species as severe adverse reactions, including fatalities in dogs, may result.</p><p>Cydectin Injectable is effective against the migrating stage of cattle grubs (<span class="Italics">Hypoderma</span> larvae). Treatment with Cydectin Injectable during the period when grubs are migrating through vital areas may cause undesirable host-parasite reactions. Killing <span class="Italics">H. lineatum</span> when they are located in peri-esophageal tissues may cause bloat. Killing <span class="Italics">H. bovis</span> when they are in the vertebral canal may cause staggering or hindlimb paralysis. Cattle should be treated as soon as possible after heel fly (warble fly) season to avoid this potential problem. Cattle treated with Cydectin Injectable at the end of fly season can be retreated during the winter without danger of grub-related reactions. Consult your veterinarian for more information regarding these secondary grub reactions and the correct time to treat with Cydectin Injectable.</p><h2>ANIMAL SAFETY</h2><p class="First">U.S. tolerance and toxicity studies have demonstrated that Cydectin Injectable has an adequate margin of safety for use in cattle 8 weeks of age and older. No toxic signs were seen in growing cattle given up to 5 times the recommended dose. Calves as young as 8 weeks of age showed no toxic signs when treated with up to 3 times the recommended dose while nursing from cows concurrently treated with the recommended dose level of Cydectin Injectable. Mild, transient ataxia was noted in growing cattle receiving 10 times the recommended dose and in bulls treated at 4.5 times the recommended dose. In breeding animals (bulls and cows in estrous and during early, mid and late pregnancy), treatment with at least 3 times the recommended dose had no effect on breeding performance.</p><p>Signs of toxicity include ataxia, excessive salivation, depression, and mydriasis. These signs usually occur within 12 to 48 hours post-treatment.</p><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Store product at or below 77°F (25°C). Protect from light.</p><h2>DISPOSAL</h2><p class="First">Do not contaminate water by direct application or by improper disposal of drug containers. Dispose of containers in an approved landfill or by incineration.</p><h2>PACKAGE INFORMATION</h2><p class="First">Cydectin Injectable is available in 200 mL and 500 mL polyethylene bottles.</p><p class="First">U.S. Patent Nos. 4,916,154 and 5,965,603 - used under license.</p><p>© 2010 Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc.
