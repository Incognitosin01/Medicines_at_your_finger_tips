You will receive this implant with a minor surgical procedure in a clinic or doctor's office.</p><p>It is best to place the implant into your non-dominant arm (your left arm if you are right-handed). Be sure to tell your doctor which arm you use most often.</p><p>The skin of your upper arm will be treated with a numbing medicine to keep you from feeling pain during the insertion. Your doctor will use a scalpel to cut a small incision where the implant will be inserted.</p><p>The histrelin implant is inserted using a special tool that pushes the implant into place through the incision in your skin. After injecting the implant and removing the insertion tool, your doctor will then feel your arm to make sure the implant has been correctly placed.</p><p>The incision in your skin may be closed with stitches or surgical strips. Follow your doctor's instructions about caring for the incision and keeping it bandaged and clean until it heals completely. Keep your arm dry for at least 24 hours.</p><p>You will most likely be able to feel the implant through your skin, but it should not cause pain or discomfort.</p><p>Call your doctor if you have any pain, swelling, tenderness, itching, tingling, bruising, or redness where the implant was inserted, or if the implant comes through the skin or falls out.</p><p>A histrelin implant is usually left in place for 12 months and then must be removed through a surgical incision. Do not try to remove the implant yourself. Your doctor will determine whether you need another implant for continued treatment.</p><p>You may have a temporary increase in precocious puberty symptoms for a week or so after you have received the Supprelin LA implant.</p><p>You may need medical tests to help your doctor determine how long to treat you with histrelin.</p><p>Histrelin can cause unusual results with certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using histrelin.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since histrelin is given as an implant, it does not have a daily dosing schedule.</p><p>The implant should not be left in your arm for longer than 12 months. Call your doctor when it is time for your implant to be removed.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since the histrelin implant contains a specific amount of the medicine, you are not likely to receive an overdose.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving a histrelin implant?</h2><p>For at least 7 days after your implant is inserted, avoid strenuous exercise or heavy lifting.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Histrelin side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
