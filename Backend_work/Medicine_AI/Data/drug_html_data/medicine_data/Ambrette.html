The seeds are the source of ambrette, an aromatic oil used in perfumery. The plant grows to about 3 feet with showy yellow flowers with crimson centers. The plant is indigenous to India and is cultivated throughout the tropics.Leung 1980</p><h2>History</h2><p>Several parts of the plant have been used throughout history, most notably the seed oil, which is valued for its fragrant smell. The oil is used in cosmetics and has been used to flavor alcoholic beverages, especially bitters, and coffee.Duke 1985 The tender leaves and shoots are eaten as vegetables and the plant is often grown as an ornamental.</p><p>Philippine native have used decoctions of the plant to treat stomach cancer, and extracts of the plant have bene used to treat such diverse ailments as hysteria, gonorrhea and respiratory disorders.Duke 1985 The seeds are used for treating headaches, cramps, muscular aches and pains, and nervous system disorders including depression.

The volatile oil is high in fatty acids, including palmitic and myristic acids. The ketone ambrettolide (a lactone of ambrettolic acid) is responsible for the characteristic musk-like odor. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed 35 compounds in the oil with farnesol acetate (51.45%) and ambrettolide (12.96%) being the major components.Arokiyaraj 2015 A variety of other related compounds have also been identified, most of which were present in quantities of less than 1%.Arokiyaraj 2015, Leung 1980</p><p>The bark yields a fiber that is used to produce tough cloths.Duke 1985</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>Ambrette has been used as a stimulant and as treatment for a variety of ills, from stomach cancer to hysteria.

Farnesol acetate and ambrettolide were observed to have sufficient binding energy towards a beta-lactamase and dihydrofolate reductase proteins.Arokiyaraj 2015</p><h3>Other uses</h3><p>The related species A. manihot has been shown to limit the development of renal injury in rabbits with immune complex-induced glomerulonephritis, and A. ficulneus may contain substances that inhibit the development of the fetal sheep brain and that may impair the health of the ewe.Walker 1992</p><p>Antioxidant and radical scavenging properties have been described. Limited antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated.Gul 2011</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of Abelmoschus moschatus (ambrette).</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>There is no clinical evidence to support dosage of ambrette.</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Information is limited. Ambrette is used traditionally for menstrual disorders.
