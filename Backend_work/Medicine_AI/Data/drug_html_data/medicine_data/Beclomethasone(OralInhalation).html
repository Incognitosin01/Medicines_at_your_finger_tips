However, regular treatment with inhaled corticosteroids has been shown to increase the risk of pneumonia, especially in those with severe disease. Combination therapy is recommended in patients with a history of hospitalization(s) for exacerbations of COPD, ≥2 moderate exacerbations of COPD per year, blood eosinophils &gt;300 cells/microliter, and concomitant or history of asthma. Combination therapy may also be considered in patients with 1 moderate exacerbation of COPD per year and blood eosinophils of 100 to 300 cells/microliter <sup>[GOLD 2019]</sup>.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to beclomethasone or any component of the formulation; status asthmaticus, or other acute asthma episodes requiring intensive measures</p><p>Documentation of allergenic cross-reactivity for corticosteroids is limited.

After symptoms stabilize or after a maximum of 14 days of quadrupled dose, whichever occurs first, patients should be returned to their baseline dose (GINA 2019). Quadrupling the inhaled corticosteroid dose has been shown to decrease the severity of an asthma exacerbation in select patients. In a randomized trial of adolescents ≥16 years and adults (n=1,871), temporarily quadrupling the inhaled corticosteroid dose when asthma control began to deteriorate resulted in fewer severe asthma exacerbations (ie, less treatment with systemic glucocorticoids or unscheduled appointments for asthma) compared to patients who maintained their inhaled corticosteroid dose (McKeever 2018). No data for quadrupling the dose in patients &lt;16 years of age has been published. Quintupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone) in children 5 to 11 years of age was not shown to reduce the rate of severe exacerbations and may have been associated adverse effects (decreased linear growth, particularly in patients &lt;8 years of age) (GINA 2019; Jackson 2018).</p><p><i>Conversion from oral systemic corticosteroid to orally-inhaled corticosteroid:</i> Initiation of oral inhalation therapy in patients on oral corticosteroids (OCS) should include a gradual dose reduction of OCS. If adrenal insufficiency occurs, temporarily increase the OCS dose and follow with a more gradual withdrawal. <b>Note:</b> When transitioning from systemic to inhaled corticosteroids, supplemental systemic corticosteroid therapy may be necessary during periods of stress or during severe asthma attacks.</p><p><i>Canadian</i><i> labeling:</i> Maintenance therapy: Metered-dose inhaler: Oral inhalation:</p><p>Children 5 to 11 years: Initial: 50 mcg twice daily; maximum dose: 100 mcg twice daily.</p><p>Children ≥12 years of age and Adolescents:</p><p>Mild asthma: 50 to 100 mcg twice daily; maximum dose: 100 mcg twice daily.</p><p>Moderate asthma: 100 to 250 mcg twice daily; maximum dose: 250 mcg twice daily.</p><p>Severe asthma: 300 to 400 mcg twice daily; maximum dose: 400 mcg twice daily.</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance.

Rinse mouth with water (without swallowing) after each use. Do not wash or put inhaler in water; mouth piece may be cleaned with a dry tissue or cloth. Discard the inhaler when the dose counter displays "0".</p><p>QVAR: Prime canister by spraying twice into the air prior to initial use or if not in use for &gt;10 days. Patients using a spacer should inhale immediately due to decreased amount of medication that is delivered with a delayed inspiration.</p><p>QVAR RediHaler: Inhaler device is breath-actuated; does not require priming before use. The white cap on the inhaler must remain closed during storage; do not open white cap until ready for use. If more than 1 inhalation is needed per dose, make sure the white cap is closed prior to next inhalation. If the white cap has been opened for &gt;2 minutes or left in the open position, close the white cap to prepare inhaler and check dose counter to make sure the inhaler is not empty. Never breathe out into the inhaler mouthpiece. Do not use with a spacer or volume-holding chamber.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions are permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F). Do not use or store near heat or open flame; do not puncture canisters. Exposure to temperatures above 49ºC (120ºF) may cause canister to burst. Never throw container into fire or incinerator. Store QVAR inhaler on concave end of canister with actuator on top.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Aldesleukin: Corticosteroids may diminish the antineoplastic effect of Aldesleukin. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Cosyntropin: Corticosteroids (Orally Inhaled) may diminish the diagnostic effect of Cosyntropin. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Desmopressin: Corticosteroids (Orally Inhaled) may enhance the hyponatremic effect of Desmopressin. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Loxapine: Agents to Treat Airway Disease may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Loxapine.

HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis. Withdrawal and discontinuation of a corticosteroid should be done slowly and carefully. Particular care is required when patients are transferred from systemic corticosteroids to inhaled products due to possible adrenal insufficiency or withdrawal from steroids, including an increase in allergic symptoms. Adult patients receiving ≥20 mg per day of prednisone (or equivalent) may be most susceptible. Fatalities have occurred due to adrenal insufficiency in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to aerosol steroids; aerosol steroids do <b>not</b> provide the systemic steroid needed to treat patients having trauma, surgery, or infections (particularly gastroenteritis), or other conditions with severe electrolyte loss. Select surgical patients on long-term, high-dose, inhaled corticosteroid should be given stress doses of hydrocortisone intravenously during the surgical period and the dose reduced rapidly within 24 hours after surgery (NAEPP 2007).</p><p>• Bronchospasm: Paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening may occur with use of inhaled bronchodilating agents; reaction should be distinguished from inadequate response. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue beclomethasone and institute alternative therapy.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (eg, angioedema, bronchospasm, rash, and urticaria) may occur; discontinue use if reaction occurs.</p><p>• Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may increase the incidence of secondary infection, mask acute infection (including fungal infections), prolong or exacerbate viral infections, or limit response to vaccines. Avoid use, if possible, in patients with ocular herpes, active or quiescent respiratory tuberculosis, or untreated viral, fungal, parasitic or bacterial systemic infections. Exposure to chickenpox and measles should be avoided; if the patient is exposed, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin or pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin, respectively, may be indicated; if chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</p><p>• Oral candidiasis: Local oropharyngeal <i>Candida albicans</i> infections have been reported; if this occurs, treat appropriately while continuing therapy. Patients should be instructed to rinse mouth with water without swallowing after each use.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Asthma: Appropriate use: Supplemental steroids (oral or parenteral) may be needed during stress or severe asthma attacks. Use is contraindicated in status asthmaticus or during other acute episodes of asthma requiring intensive measures.</p><p>• Bone mineral density: Use with caution in patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral count such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (eg, anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids); long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with decreases in bone mineral density.</p><p>• Ocular disease: Use with caution in patients with cataracts and/or glaucoma; blurred vision, increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataracts have occurred with prolonged use. Consider routine eye exams in chronic users.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Pediatric: Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients (~1 centimeter per year [range: 0.3 to 1.8 cm per year] and related to dose and duration of exposure). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, each patient should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. Growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Discontinuation of therapy: A gradual tapering of dose may be required prior to discontinuing therapy; there have been reports of systemic corticosteroid withdrawal symptoms (eg, joint/muscle pain, lassitude, depression) when withdrawing oral inhalation therapy.</p><p>• Transfer to oral inhaler: When transferring to oral inhalation therapy from systemic corticosteroid therapy, previously suppressed allergic conditions (rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, and eosinophilic conditions) may be unmasked. Withdraw systemic corticosteroid therapy by gradually tapering the dose. Monitor lung function, beta-agonist use, asthma symptoms, and for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (eg, fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea/vomiting, hypotension) during withdrawal.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>FEV<sub>1</sub>, peak flow, and/or other pulmonary function tests; bone mineral density; growth (adolescents and children via stadiometry); signs/symptoms of HPA axis suppression/adrenal insufficiency; possible eosinophilic conditions (including eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [formerly known as Churg-Strauss]), signs/symptoms of oral candidiasis; asthma symptoms; glaucoma/cataracts</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Maternal use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in usual doses is not associated with an increased risk of fetal malformations; a small risk of malformations was observed in one study following maternal doses of beclomethasone &gt;1,000 mcg/day. Uncontrolled asthma is associated with adverse events on pregnancy (increased risk of perinatal mortality, preeclampsia, preterm birth, low-birth-weight infants, cesarean delivery, and the development of gestational diabetes). Poorly controlled asthma or asthma exacerbations may have a greater fetal/maternal risk than what is associated with appropriately used asthma medications. Maternal treatment improves pregnancy outcomes by reducing the risk of some adverse events (eg, preterm birth and gestational diabetes) (ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020]; GINA 2020).</p><p>Inhaled corticosteroids are recommended for the treatment of asthma during pregnancy (GINA 2020). Beclomethasone is one of the preferred agents. The lowest dose that maintains asthma control should be used. Maternal asthma symptoms should be monitored monthly during pregnancy (ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020])</p><p>Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes associated with asthma and the medications used to treat asthma in pregnancy is ongoing. Health care providers are encouraged to enroll exposed pregnant females in the MotherToBaby Pregnancy Studies conducted by the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS) (877-311-8972 or https://mothertobaby.org). Patients may also enroll themselves.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat asthma.</p><p>• Do not use this drug to treat an asthma attack.
