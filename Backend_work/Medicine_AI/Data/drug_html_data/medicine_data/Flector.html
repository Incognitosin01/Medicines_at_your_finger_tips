Diclofenac epolamine works by reducing substances in the body that cause pain and inflammation.</p><p>Flector patches are used to treat pain caused by minor sprains, strains, or bruising.</p><p>Flector patches are for use in adults and children at least 6 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before using Flector, tell your doctor if you are allergic to any drugs, or if you have heart disease, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, a history of heart attack or stroke, a history of stomach ulcer or bleeding, liver or kidney disease, a blood clotting disorder, asthma or polyps in your nose, or if you smoke.</p><p>Diclofenac can increase your risk of fatal heart attack or stroke, especially if you use it long term or take high doses, or if you have heart disease. Do not use Flector just before or after heart bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG).</p><p>Get emergency medical help if you have chest pain, weakness, shortness of breath, slurred speech, or problems with vision or balance while using Flector Patches.</p><p>While the risk of absorbing diclofenac into your bloodstream is low, an NSAID may cause life-threatening heart or circulation problems such as heart attack or stroke, especially if you use it long term.</p><p>Flector may also cause serious effects on the stomach or intestines, including bleeding or perforation (forming of a hole). These conditions can be fatal and can occur without warning while you are using Flector, especially in older adults.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have symptoms of stomach bleeding such as black, bloody, or tarry stools, or coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Diclofenac can increase your risk of fatal heart attack or stroke, even if you don't have any risk factors. Do not use this medicine just before or after heart bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG).</p><p>Diclofenac may also cause stomach or intestinal bleeding, which can be fatal. These conditions can occur without warning while you are using this medicine, especially in older adults.</p><p>You should not use Flector if you are allergic to diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam, Cambia, Solaraze, Pennsaid, and others), or if you have ever had an asthma attack or severe allergic reaction after taking aspirin or an NSAID.</p><p>To make sure Flector is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>

Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use Flector ?</h2><p>Use Flector Patches exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Use the lowest dose that is effective in treating your condition.</p><p>Using extra patches will not make the medicine more effective, and could cause dangerous side effects.</p><p>Apply the topical system directly to the area of pain. The patch can be worn for up to 12 hours and then removed. Apply a new patch at that time if pain continues.</p><p>Do not apply Flector on an open skin wound, or on areas of eczema, infection, skin rash, or burn injury.</p><p>Wash your hands after applying or removing a patch.</p><p>If the patch does not stick well, you may place medical tape around the edges. You may also use a mesh netting sleeve to hold a patch in place on your skin. Do not cover the patch with a bandage or other covering that does not allow air to pass through.</p><p>After removing a patch, fold it in half, sticky side in, and throw it away in a place where children or pets cannot get to it. <b>Keep both used and unused patches out of the reach of children or pets.</b></p><p>If you use Flector patch long-term, you may need frequent medical tests.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Reseal the storage envelope each time you remove a patch from it.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Apply a Flector patch as soon as you remember, and wear it for 12 hours before applying a new one. Do not use extra patches to make up the missed dose. Do not wear a Flector patch for longer than 12 hours.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using Flector?</h2><p>Do not wear a Flector patch while taking a bath or shower or while swimming.</p><p>Avoid getting a patch near your eyes, nose, or mouth.
