Clindamycin exhibits <i>in vitro</i> activity against <i>Cutibacterium acnes</i>, an organism associated with acne vulgaris. Topical tretinoin is believed to decrease follicular epithelial cells cohesiveness and increase follicular epithelial cell turnover resulting in decreased microcomedo formation and increased expulsion of comedones.</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Topical: Tretinoin: Minimal systemic absorption; Clindamycin: Low, but variable systemic absorption</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Acne:</b> For the treatment of acne vulgaris in patients ≥12 years.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, history of antibiotic-associated colitis</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Hypersensitivity to clindamycin, tretinoin, or any component of the formulation; hypersensitivity to lincomycin</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Acne:</b> Topical: Apply once daily in the evening or at bedtime.</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Acne vulgaris:</b> Topical: Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: Topical: Apply pea-size amount to entire face once daily in the evening or at bedtime; <b>Note:</b> Higher dosages (larger amount or more frequent use) have not been shown to improve efficacy and are associated with increased adverse effects (eg, skin irritation).</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>For external use only. Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. Prior to application, gently wash face with a mild soap and pat dry. Apply in the evening or at bedtime. Apply a pea-size amount to one fingertip and then dotted on chin, cheeks, nose, and forehead. Avoid contact with sunburned skin. Gently rub over entire face or entire affected area while avoiding eyes, mouth, angles of nose, and mucous membranes.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F); do not freeze.

Daily sunscreen use and other protective measures recommended. Use is not recommended in patients with sunburn.</p><p>• Skin irritation: Treatment can increase skin sensitivity to weather extremes of wind or cold. Also, concomitant topical medications (eg, medicated or abrasive soaps, cleansers, or cosmetics with a strong drying effect) should be used with caution due to increased skin irritation.</p><p>• Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including <i>Clostridioides</i> (formerly <i>Clostridium</i>) <i>difficile</i>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed &gt;2 months postantibiotic treatment. Discontinue drug if significant diarrhea, abdominal cramps, or passage of blood and mucus occurs.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues: </i></b></p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For external use only; not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use; avoid mucous membranes, eyes, mouth, and angles of nose.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
