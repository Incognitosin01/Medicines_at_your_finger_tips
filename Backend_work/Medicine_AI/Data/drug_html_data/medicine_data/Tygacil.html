Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully. The medicine must be given slowly, and each IV infusion can take 30 to 60 minutes to complete.</p><p>Tygacil is a powder medicine that must be mixed with a liquid (diluent) in an IV bag before using it. If you are using the injections at home, be sure you understand how to properly mix and store the medication.</p><p>Prepare your dose only when you are ready to give an injection. After mixing, the liquid should appear as a yellow or orange color. Do not use if the medicine has changed to green or black, or if it has any particles in it.
