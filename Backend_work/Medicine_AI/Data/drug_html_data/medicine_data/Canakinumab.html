Canakinumab is used to treat certain types of periodic fever syndromes, sometimes called auto-inflammatory syndromes.</p><p>Periodic fever syndromes are rare and often inherited conditions caused by mutations in certain genes; usually genes that are involved in producing a certain protein or enzyme in the body. People with a periodic fever syndrome have episodes of fever and inflammation without other causes such as infection or virus.</p><p>Canakinumab is used to treat the following periodic fever syndromes in adults and children who are at least 4 years old:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes, including Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome and Muckle-Wells Syndrome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome, also called Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency</p>
</li>
