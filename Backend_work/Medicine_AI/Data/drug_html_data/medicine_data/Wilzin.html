Each bottle contains 250 capsules.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Introduction<br/></span> Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is an autosomal recessive metabolic defect in hepatic excretion of copper in the bile, resulting in accumulation of excess copper in the liver, and subsequently in other organs, including the brain, kidneys, eyes, bone, and muscles.  In this disease, hepatocytes store excess copper, but when their capacity is exceeded copper is released into the blood and is taken up in extrahepatic sites, such as the brain, resulting in motor disorders (ataxia, tremors, speech difficulties) and psychiatric manifestations (irritability, depression, deterioration of work performance).  Redistribution of excess copper in hepatocytes leads to hepatocellular injury, inflammation, necrosis, and eventual cirrhosis.  Patients may present clinically with predominantly hepatic, neurologic, or psychiatric symptoms.</p><p>The disease has been treated by restricting copper in the diet, and the use of chelating agents to bind free copper to reduce its toxicity and facilitate its excretion.  The purpose of initial treatment of symptomatic patients with a chelating agent is to detoxify copper.   Once the patient's symptoms have stabilized clinically, maintenance treatment begins.  Clinical measures are used to determine whether the patient remains stable (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS: Monitoring Patients</span>).</p><p>The active moiety in zinc acetate is zinc cation.  Regardless of the ligand, zinc blocks the intestinal absorption of copper from the diet and the reabsorption of endogenously secreted copper such as that from the saliva, gastric juice and bile.  Zinc induces the production of metallothionein in the enterocyte, a protein that binds copper thereby preventing its serosal transfer into the blood.  The bound copper is then lost in the stool following desquamation of the intestinal cells.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics<br/></span> Because the proposed site of action of zinc is an effect on copper uptake at the level of the intestinal cell, pharmacokinetic evaluations based on blood levels of zinc do not provide useful information on zinc bioavailability at the site of action.  Determinations of zinc content in the liver and the plasma zinc concentration after the oral administration of zinc acetate have yielded inconsistent results. However, foods and beverages have been shown to decrease the uptake of zinc thereby decreasing the levels of zinc in the plasma of healthy volunteers.  For this reason, the oral dose of zinc should be separated from food and beverages, other than water, by at least one hour.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties</span></p><p>Pharmacotherapeutic group: various alimentary tract and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX05.</p><p>Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is an autosomal recessive metabolic defect in hepatic excretion of copper in the bile. Copper accumulation in the liver leads to hepatocellular injury and eventual cirrhosis. When the liver capacity of storing copper is exceeded copper is released into the blood and is taken up in extra hepatic sites, such as the brain, resulting in motor disorders and psychiatric manifestations. Patients may present clinically with predominantly hepatic, neurologic, or psychiatric symptoms.</p><p>The active moiety in zinc acetate dihydrate is zinc cation, which blocks the intestinal absorption of copper from the diet and the reabsorption of endogenously secreted copper. Zinc induces the production of metallothionein in the enterocyte, a protein that binds copper thereby preventing its transfer into the blood. The bound copper is then eliminated in the stool following desquamation of the intestinal cells.</p><p>Pharmacodynamic investigations of copper metabolism in patients with Wilson's disease included determinations of net copper balance and radiolabelled copper uptake. A daily regimen of 150 mg of Wilzin in three administrations was shown to be effective in significantly reducing copper absorption and inducing a negative copper balance.</p><p><span class="Bold">5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties<br/></span> Since the mechanism of action of zinc is an effect on copper uptake at the level of the intestinal cell, pharmacokinetic evaluations based on blood levels of zinc do not provide useful information on zinc bioavailability at the site of action.</p><p>Zinc is absorbed in the small intestine and its absorption kinetics suggest a tendency to saturation at increasing doses. Fractional zinc absorption is negatively correlated with zinc intake. It ranges from 30 to 60% with usual dietary intake (7-15 mg/d) and decreases to 7% with pharmacological doses of 100 mg/d.</p><p>In the blood, about 80% of absorbed zinc is distributed to erythrocytes, with most of the remainder being bound to albumin and other plasma proteins. The liver is the main storage for zinc and hepatic zinc levels are increased during maintenance therapy with zinc.</p><p class="First">Zinc Acetate Capsules are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the formulation.</p><p class="First">Zinc acetate is not recommended for the initial therapy of symptomatic patients because of the delay required for zinc-induced increase in enterocytic metallothionein and blockade of copper uptake.  Symptomatic patients should be treated initially, using chelating agents.  During initial therapy, neurological deterioration may occur as stores of copper are mobilized.  Once initial therapy has been completed, and the patient is clinically stable, maintenance treatment with zinc acetate can be considered, but patients may be continued on initial therapy as clinically indicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Information for Patients<br/></span> Patients should take GALZIN<span class="Sup">®</span> on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or two to three hours after meals.  Capsules should be swallowed whole, not opened or chewed.  In the rare event of gastric intolerance of zinc, generally occurring with the morning dose, this dose may be taken between breakfast and lunch.  Patients must be clinically monitored to determine the adequacy of zinc acetate therapy.  Since strict adherence to the zinc regimen is essential for optimal control of copper distribution and metabolism, the physician must reinforce the need for compliance at each contact with the patient.</p><p><span class="Bold">Monitoring Patients</span></p><p>Patients should be monitored primarily by assessment of existing signs and symptoms of Wilson’s disease and 24-hour urine copper.  Neuropsychiatric evaluations including speech as well as liver function tests including bilirubin and aminotransferases, should be done as appropriate.</p><p>The urinary excretion of copper is an accurate reflection of the body status of copper when patients are not on chelation therapy.  The clinician should be aware that urinary copper levels are usually increased with chelation therapy such as penicillamine or trientine.  Adequate zinc therapy will eventually decrease urinary copper excretion to 125 μg per 24 hours or less. A significant trend upward indicates impending loss of copper control.   The non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper (also known as free copper) is obtained by subtracting the ceruloplasmin-bound copper from the total plasma copper.  Each mg of ceruloplasmin contains 3 μg of copper.  In the United States study, non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper concentration was kept below 20 μg/dL.  Urine and plasma for copper determinations should be collected in copper-free containers and assayed with equipment capable of accurately measuring copper at levels as low as 0.01 μg/mL.</p><p>An additional monitoring tool, if available, is the amount of radioactivity measured in the plasma 1 or 2 hours after orally administered <span class="Sup">64</span>copper.  In adequately controlled patients, the amount is less than 1.2% of the administered dose.  The level of hepatic copper should not be used to manage therapy since it does not differentiate between potentially toxic free copper and safely bound copper.</p><p class="First">Nevertheless, while awaiting zinc induced duodenal metallothionein production and consequential effective inhibition of copper absorption, zinc acetate dehydrate could be administered initially in symptomatic patients in combination with a chelating agent.</p><p>Although rare, clinical deterioration may occur at the beginning of the treatment, as has also been reported with chelating agents. Whether this is related to mobilisation of copper stores or to natural history of the disease remains unclear. A change of therapy is recommended in this situation.</p><p>Caution should be exercised when switching patients with portal hypertension from a chelating agent to Wilzin, when such patients are doing well and the treatment is tolerated. Two patients of a series of 16 died from hepatic decompensation and advanced portal hypertension after being changed from penicillamine to zinc therapy.</p><p><span class="Italics">Therapeutic monitoring</span></p><p>The aim of the treatment is to maintain the plasma free copper (also known as non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper) below 250 microgram/l (normal: 100-150 microgram/l) and the urinary copper excretion below 125 microgram/24 h (normal: &lt; 50 microgram/24 h). The non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper is calculated by subtracting the ceruloplasmin-bound copper from the total plasma copper, given that each milligram of ceruloplasmin contains 3 micrograms of copper.</p><p>The urinary excretion of copper is an accurate reflection of body loading with excess copper only when patients are not on chelation therapy. Urinary copper levels are usually increased with chelation therapy such as penicillamine or trientine.</p><p>The level of hepatic copper cannot be used to manage therapy since it does not differentiate between potentially toxic free copper and metallothionein bound copper.</p><p>In treated patients, assays of urinary and/or plasma zinc may be a useful measure of treatment compliance. Values of urinary zinc above 2 mg/24 h and of plasma zinc above 1250 microgram/l generally indicate adequate compliance.</p><p>Like with all anti-copper agents overtreatment carries the risk of copper deficiency, which is especially harmful for children and pregnant women since copper is required for proper growth and mental development. In these patient groups, urinary copper levels should be kept a little above the upper limit of normal or in the high normal range (i.e. 40 – 50 microgram/24 h).</p><p>Laboratory follow-up including haematological surveillance and lipoproteins determination should also be performed in order to detect early manifestations of copper deficiency, such as anaemia and/or leukopenia resulting from bone marrow depression, and decrease in HDL cholesterol and HDL/total cholesterol ratio.</p><p class="First">Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000), very rare (&lt; 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).</p><p>Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.</p><p>Anaemia may be micro-, normo- or macrocytic and is often associated with leukopenia. Bone marrow examination usually reveals characteristic "ringed sideroblasts" (i.e. developing red blood cells containing iron-engorged paranuclear mitochondria). They may be early manifestations of copper deficiency and may recover rapidly following reduction of zinc dosage. However, they must be distinguished from haemolytic anaemia which commonly occurs where there is elevated serum free copper in uncontrolled Wilson's disease.</p><p>The most common undesirable effect is gastric irritation. This is usually worst with the first morning dose and disappears after the first days of treatment. Delaying the first dose to mid-morning or taking the dose with a little protein may usually relieve the symptoms.</p><p>Elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase, amylase and lipase may occur after a few weeks of treatment, with levels usually returning to high normal within the first one or two years of treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">United Kingdom<br/></span> Yellow Card Scheme<br/>

Therefore, precautions for zinc acetate effects do not seem necessary when Wilson’s disease patients are taking vitamin C or approved chelating agents.  However, no data are available to demonstrate that zinc acetate should be added to other drugs used for the treatment of Wilson’s disease patients or is safe.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Other anti-copper agents</span></p><p>Pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in Wilson's disease patients on the combination of Wilzin (50 mg three times daily) with ascorbic acid (1 g once daily), penicillamine (250 mg four times daily), and trientine (250 mg four times daily).</p><p>They showed no significant overall effect on copper balance although mild interaction of zinc with chelators (penicillamine and trientine) could be detected with decreased faecal but increased urinary copper excretion as compared with zinc alone. This is probably due to some extent of complexion of zinc by the chelator, thus reducing the effect of both active substances.</p><p>When switching a patient on chelating treatment to Wilzin for maintenance therapy, the chelating treatment should be maintained and co-administered for 2 to 3 weeks since this is the time it takes for the zinc treatment to induce maximum metallothionein induction and full blockade of copper absorption. The administration of the chelating treatment and Wilzin should be separated by at least 1 hour.</p><p><span class="Italics">Other medicinal products</span></p><p>The absorption of zinc may be reduced by iron and calcium supplements, tetracyclines and phosphorus-containing compounds, while zinc may reduce the absorption of iron, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones.</p><p><span class="Italics">Food</span></p><p class="First">Zinc does appear in breast milk and zinc-induced copper deficiency in the nursing baby may occur. Therefore, it is recommended that women on zinc therapy not nurse their babies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">4.6 Pregnancy and lactation</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy</span></p><p>Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies in patients with Wilson's disease give no indication of harmful effects of zinc on embryo/foetus and mother. Five miscarriages and 2 birth defects (microcephaly and correctable heart defect) were reported in 42 pregnancies.</p><p>Animal studies conducted with different zinc salts do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</p><p>It is extremely important that pregnant Wilson's disease patients continue their therapy during pregnancy. Which treatment should be used, zinc or chelating agent should be decided by the physician. Dose adjustments to guarantee that the foetus will not become copper deficient must be done and close monitoring of the patient is mandatory (see section 4.4).</p><p><span class="Italics">Lactation</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span></p><p>Acute oral overdosage with inorganic salts of zinc in humans is reported rarely. In the event of overdosage, the unabsorbed zinc salt should be removed from the stomach by lavage as quickly as possible.  The plasma level of zinc should be measured, and heavy metal chelation therapy should be considered if the plasma level of zinc is elevated markedly (&gt;1000 μg/dL). In addition, any signs or symptoms of toxicity should be treated as medically indicated.</p><p>One fatality associated with overdosage of zinc sulfate has been reported.  The death of this adult woman followed the accidental ingestion of approximately 28 g of zinc sulfate.  Death occurred on the fifth day after ingestion and was attributed to renal failure.  Hemorrhagic pancreatitis and hyperglycemic coma resulted from the overdose.  The amount ingested was 500 mg/Kg of zinc sulfate, a value that is in the same order of magnitude as that found to be lethal in animals.</p><p class="First">Treatment of overdose should be with gastric lavage or induced emesis as quickly as possible to remove unabsorbed zinc. Heavy metal chelation therapy should be considered if plasma zinc levels are markedly elevated (&gt; 10 mg/l).</p><p class="First">Zinc acetate has not been tested for its carcinogenic potential in long-term animal studies, for its mutagenic potential or for its effect on fertility in animals.</p><p>However, testing with other salts of zinc (zinc oxide, zinc stearate, zinc sulfate) did not reveal a mutagenicity potential in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ames assays, and human embryonic lung cell chromosomal aberration assay, and in <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> rat dominant lethal assay, and rat bone marrow cell chromosomal aberration assay.</p><p>Other salts of zinc (zinc oxide, zinc chloride, zinc citrate, zinc maleate, zinc carbonate, zinc sulfate) and pure zinc dust at oral doses up to 326 mg/Kg/day (18 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) were found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy: <span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects.</span> </span></p><p>Studies in pregnant women have not shown that zinc acetate or zinc sulfate increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during all trimesters of pregnancy.  If this drug is used during pregnancy, the possibility of fetal harm appears remote.  Because studies cannot rule out the possibility of harm, however, zinc acetate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. While zinc acetate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed, copper toxicosis can develop during pregnancy if anti-copper therapy is stopped.</p><p>Oral teratology studies have been performed with zinc sulfate in pregnant rats at doses up to 42.5 mg/Kg/day (2 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area), mice at doses up to 30 mg/Kg/day (1 time the recommended human dose based on body surface area), rabbits at doses up to 60 mg/Kg/day (6 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and hamsters at doses up to 88 mg/Kg/day (5 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to zinc sulfate. (See <span class="Bold">CLINICAL TRIALS</span>).</p><p class="First">Preclinical studies have been conducted with zinc acetate and with other zinc salts. Pharmacological and toxicological data available showed large similarities between zinc salts and among animal species.</p><p>The oral LD50 is approximately 300 mg zinc/kg body weight (about 100 to 150 times the human therapeutic dose). Repeat-dose toxicity studies have established that the NOEL (No Observed Effect Level) is about 95 mg zinc/kg body weight (about 48 times the human therapeutic dose).</p><p>The weight of evidence, from <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> tests, suggests that zinc has no clinically relevant genotoxic activity.</p><p>Reproduction toxicology studies performed with different zinc salts showed no clinically relevant evidence of embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity or teratogenicity.</p><p class="First">Rev. 7/2020</p><p>Distributed by:<br/>

Patients were hospitalized to carefully control food and liquid intake.  Food, urine and feces were analyzed for copper content, and copper balance was defined as the difference between copper intake and copper elimination/excretion over a 10-day period.  A patient was considered in adequate copper balance if the result was less than +0.25 mg copper/day.  Results for the groups in each dose regimen tested and for adequacy of individual results are provided in the following table.</p><p>*N = number of copper balance studies.  Some patients had more than one balance study, at different doses or at the same dose at widely separated intervals.</p><p>While all zinc acetate regimens appeared better than no therapy, there was little experience with doses other than 50 mg t.i.d.  Once daily dosing did not appear to give satisfactory control in many cases, and would be inadequate in patients with poor compliance.  Based on the limited data available 25 mg t.i.d. was also thought to be an adequate dose regimen, and not shown to be inferior to 50 mg t.i.d.  Dose related toxicity was not found in this study.</p><p><span class="Bold">Symptomatic Patients Initially Treated With a Chelating Drug</span></p><p>Clinical parameters such as neuropsychiatric status including evaluation of speech, and liver function tests were followed as the patients continued therapy on an adequate zinc acetate dose regimen.  One hundred and thirty-three patients were followed for up to 14 years.  There was no deterioration of neuropsychiatric function including speech and biochemical liver function tests, including bilirubin, transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and lactic dehydrogenase.  The liver function tests remained either within normal range or slightly above the upper limit of normal for up to 9 years of treatment.</p><p class="First">In this study 30 pre-symptomatic patients were followed for up to 10 years. Diagnosis of the pre-symptomatic Wilson’s disease was made on the basis of a liver copper value greater than 200 μg of copper per gram dry weight of tissue.</p><p>Non-ceruloplasmin copper levels, <span class="Sup">64</span>Cu balance studies, and clinical parameters were assessed. No patient developed symptoms of Wilson’s disease in this cohort.  Since the cloning and sequencing of the abnormal genes in Wilson’s disease patients, many mutations have been identified that may affect the rate of disease progression.  No matched historical control has been compared to this experience, nor has another center replicated this experience.</p><p>In a study in the Netherlands, using zinc sulfate, 27 patients were followed up to 29 years by mainly clinical parameters such as tremors, dysarthria, dystonia, ataxia and Kayser-Fleischer rings. No deterioration of the clinical status was observed.  In some cases, Kayser-Fleischer rings disappeared and clinical signs and symptoms improved.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnant Patients</span></p><p>Included in a continuing single center United States trial are 19 symptomatic and presymptomatic women who became pregnant and continued Galzin therapy.  These women delivered 26 live birth babies.  At the time of delivery, the duration of zinc acetate therapy had ranged from 0.7 to 13.7 years.  At the time of delivery all patients were using zinc acetate.  The zinc acetate dosage at the start of pregnancy ranged from 25 to 50 mg two to three times a day.  Two patients were being treated with penicillamine at the start of pregnancy and were switched to zinc acetate during the second month of pregnancy.</p><ul class="Disc">
