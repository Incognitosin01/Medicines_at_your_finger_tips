This test determines how well your kidneys are working.</p><p>Phenolsulfonphthalein passes out of the body almost entirely in the urine. Measuring the amount of phenolsulfonphthalein in the urine can help the doctor determine if the kidneys are working properly.</p><p>How test is done: After you have emptied your bladder, phenolsulfonphthalein will be given by injection. Then you will be asked to empty your bladder into a container one or more times after the medicine is given. The amount of phenolsulfonphthalein in your urine will be measured. Then the results of the test will be studied. The way the phenolsulfonphthalein test is done may be different for different patients. Some patients may have the phenolsulfonphthalein injected into a vein, others, into a muscle.</p><p>It is very important that you empty the bladder completely and collect all the urine when you are asked to do so. If any urine is left behind or lost, it will change the results of the test.</p><p>Phenolsulfonphthalein is to be used only under the supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using phenolsulfonphthalein</h2><p>In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do.
