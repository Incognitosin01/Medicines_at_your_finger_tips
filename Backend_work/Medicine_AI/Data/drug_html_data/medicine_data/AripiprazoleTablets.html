When the coadministered drug is withdrawn from the combination therapy, Aripiprazole Tablets dosage should then be adjusted to its original level. When the coadministered CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn, Aripiprazole Tablets dosage should be reduced to the original level over 1 to 2 weeks. Patients who may be receiving a combination of strong, moderate, and weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 (e.g., a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor or a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor with a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor), the dosing may be reduced to one-quarter (25%) of the usual dose initially and then adjusted to achieve a favorable clinical response.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Dose Adjustments for Aripiprazole Tablets in Patients who are known CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers and Patients Taking Concomitant CYP2D6 Inhibitors, 3A4 Inhibitors, and/or CYP3A4 Inducers</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Factors</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dosage Adjustments for Aripiprazole Tablets</span></p><p class="First">Known CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers</p><p class="First">Administer half of usual dose</p><p class="First">Known CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers taking concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin)</p><p class="First">Administer a quarter of usual dose</p><p class="First">Strong CYP2D6 (e.g., quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) <span class="Bold">or</span> CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin)</p><p class="First">Administer half of usual dose</p><p class="First">Strong CYP2D6 <span class="Bold">and</span> CYP3A4 inhibitors</p><p class="First">Administer a quarter of usual dose</p><p class="First">Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin)</p><p class="First">Double usual dose over 1 to 2 weeks</p><h3>Dosing of Oral Solution</h3><p class="First">The oral solution can be substituted for tablets on a mg-per-mg basis up to the 25 mg dose level.

If the prescriber elects to treat such patients with aripiprazole, assess for the emergence of difficulty swallowing or excessive somnolence, which could predispose to accidental injury or aspiration <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning].</span></p><h3>Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke</h3><p class="First">In placebo-controlled clinical studies (two flexible dose and one fixed dose study) of dementia-related psychosis, there was an increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, in aripiprazole-treated patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78 to 88 years). In the fixed-dose study, there was a statistically significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole. Aripiprazole is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning].</span></p><h3>Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults</h3><p class="CM67 First">Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term, placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p><p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 5.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 5:</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Age Range</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Increases Compared to Placebo</span></p><p class="First">&lt;18</p><p class="First">14 additional cases</p><p class="First">18 to 24</p><p class="First">5 additional cases</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Decreases Compared to Placebo</span></p><p class="First">25 to 64</p><p class="First">1 fewer case</p><p class="First">≥65</p><p class="First">6 fewer cases</p><p class="CM68">No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p class="CM67">It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.</p><p class="CM67"><span class="Bold">All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.</span></p><p class="CM67">The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p><p class="CM67">Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms.</p><p class="Default"><span class="Bold">Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for aripiprazole should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.</span></p><p>It should be noted that aripiprazole is not approved for use in treating depression in the pediatric population.</p><h3>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)</h3><p class="CM67 First">A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) may occur with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole. Rare cases of NMS occurred during aripiprazole treatment in the worldwide clinical database. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.</p><p class="CM67">The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.</p><p class="Default">The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.</p><p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.</p><h3>Tardive Dyskinesia</h3><p class="CM67 First">A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.</p><p class="CM67">The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.</p><p class="CM67">Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and, thereby, may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</p><p class="CM67">Given these considerations, aripiprazole should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.</p><p>If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on aripiprazole, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with aripiprazole despite the presence of the syndrome.</p><h3>Metabolic Changes</h3><p class="CM67 First">Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.</p><p class="CM67"><span class="Bold">Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus</span></p><p class="CM67">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with aripiprazole <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].</span> Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Because aripiprazole was not marketed at the time these studies were performed, it is not known if aripiprazole is associated with this increased risk. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.</p><p class="CM67">Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.</p><p class="CM67"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>In an analysis of 13 placebo-controlled monotherapy trials in adults, primarily with schizophrenia or another indication, the mean change in fasting glucose in aripiprazole-treated patients (+4.4 mg/dL; median exposure 25 days; N=1057) was not significantly different than in placebo-treated patients (+2.5 mg/dL; median exposure 22 days; N=799).

However, due to Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.</span></p><h3>Pathological Gambling and Other Compulsive Behaviours</h3><p class="First">Post-marketing case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these urges while taking aripiprazole. Other compulsive urges, reported less frequently, include: sexual urges, shopping, eating or binge eating, and other impulsive or compulsive behaviors. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or intense gambling urges, compulsive sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be associated with the underlying disorder. In some cases, although not all, urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Compulsive behaviors may result in harm to the patient and others if not recognized. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges.</p><h3>Orthostatic Hypotension</h3><p class="Default First">Aripiprazole may cause orthostatic hypotension, perhaps due to its α<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenergic receptor antagonism. The incidence of orthostatic hypotension-associated events from short-term, placebo-controlled trials of adult patients on oral aripiprazole (n=2467) included (aripiprazole incidence, placebo incidence) orthostatic hypotension (1%, 0.3%), postural dizziness (0.5%, 0.3%), and syncope (0.5%, 0.4%); of pediatric patients 6 to 18 years of age (n=732) on oral aripiprazole included orthostatic hypotension (0.5%, 0%), postural dizziness (0.4%, 0%), and syncope (0.2%, 0%) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><p class="Default">The incidence of a significant orthostatic change in blood pressure (defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure ≥20 mmHg accompanied by an increase in heart rate ≥25 bpm when comparing standing to supine values) for aripiprazole was not meaningfully different from placebo (aripiprazole incidence, placebo incidence): in adult oral aripiprazole­-treated patients (4%, 2%), in pediatric oral aripiprazole-treated patients aged 6 to 18 years (0.4%, 1%).</p><p>Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Falls</h3><p class="First">Antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.</p><h3>Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis</h3><p class="CM67 First">In clinical trials and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including aripiprazole. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.</p><p class="CM66">Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC/ANC or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of aripiprazole at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.</p><p>Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue aripiprazole in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/mm<span class="Sup">3) and follow their WBC counts until recovery. </span></p><h3>Seizures/Convulsions</h3><p class="CM67 First">In short-term, placebo-controlled trials, patients with a history of seizures excluded seizures/convulsions occurred in 0.1% (3/2467) of undiagnosed adult patients treated with oral aripiprazole, in 0.1% (1/732) of pediatric patients (6 to 18 years).</p><p>As with other antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older.</p><h3>Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment</h3><p class="Default First">Aripiprazole, like other antipsychotics, may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. For example, in short-term, placebo-controlled trials, somnolence (including sedation) was reported as follows (aripiprazole incidence, placebo incidence): in adult patients (n=2467) treated with oral aripiprazole (11%, 6%), in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 (n=611) (24%, 6%). Somnolence (including sedation) led to discontinuation in 0.3% (8/2467) of adult patients and 3% (20/732) of pediatric patients (6 to 18 years) on oral aripiprazole in short-term, placebo-controlled trials.</p><p>Despite the relatively modest increased incidence of these events compared to placebo, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with aripiprazole does not affect them adversely. </p><h3>Body Temperature Regulation</h3><p class="CM11 First">Disruption of the body’s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing aripiprazole for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, (e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Suicide</h3><p class="First">The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illnesses and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for aripiprazole should be written for the smallest quantity consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Dysphagia</h3><p class="First">Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including aripiprazole. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer’s dementia. Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="Default First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="CM67">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: </p><ul>

Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of aripiprazole misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drug-seeking behavior). </p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">In physical dependence studies in monkeys, withdrawal symptoms were observed upon abrupt cessation of dosing. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">MedDRA terminology has been used to classify the adverse reactions.<br/></p><h3>Human Experience</h3><p class="CM67 First">In clinical trials and in postmarketing experience, adverse reactions of deliberate or accidental overdosage with oral aripiprazole have been reported worldwide. These include overdoses with oral aripiprazole alone and in combination with other substances. No fatality was reported with aripiprazole alone. The largest known dose with a known outcome involved acute ingestion of 1260 mg of oral aripiprazole (42 times the maximum recommended daily dose) by a patient who fully recovered. Deliberate or accidental overdosage was also reported in children (age 12 and younger) involving oral aripiprazole tablet ingestions up to 195 mg with no fatalities.</p><p>Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 5% of all overdose cases) reported with oral aripiprazole overdosage (alone or in combination with other substances) include vomiting, somnolence, and tremor. Other clinically important signs and symptoms observed in one or more patients with aripiprazole overdoses (alone or with other substances) include acidosis, aggression, aspartate aminotransferase increased, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, coma, confusional state, convulsion, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, depressed level of consciousness, hypertension, hypokalemia, hypotension, lethargy, loss of consciousness, QRS complex prolonged, QT prolonged, pneumonia aspiration, respiratory arrest, status epilepticus, and tachycardia.</p><h3>Management of Overdosage</h3><p class="CM67 First">No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with aripiprazole. An electrocardiogram should be obtained in case of overdosage and if QT interval prolongation is present, cardiac monitoring should be instituted. Otherwise, management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.</p><p class="CM67"><span class="Italics">Charcoal:</span> In the event of an overdose of aripiprazole, an early charcoal administration may be useful in partially preventing the absorption of aripiprazole. Administration of 50 g of activated charcoal, one hour after a single 15 mg oral dose of aripiprazole, decreased the mean AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of aripiprazole by 50%.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hemodialysis: Although there is no information on the effect of hemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins. </span></p><h2>Aripiprazole Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Aripiprazole is a psychotropic drug that is available as Aripiprazole Tablets. Aripiprazole Tablets, USP are chemically designated as 7-[4-[4-(2,3-Dichlorophenyl)-1­piperazinyl]butoxy]-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone. The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">23</span>H<span class="Sub">27</span>Cl<span class="Sub">2</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>, and molecular weight is 448.39. The chemical structure is as follows:</p><p></p><p class="CM67">Aripiprazole Tablets, USP are available in 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg strengths. Inactive ingredients include corn starch, FD&amp;C Blue #2/Indigo Carmine Al, ferric oxide red, ferric oxide yellow, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose.</p><p>FDA approved dissolution test specifications differ from USP</p><h2>Aripiprazole Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of aripiprazole in schizophrenia is unclear. However, the efficacy of aripiprazole in the listed indications could be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at D<span class="Sub">2</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span> receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span> receptors.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span> and D<span class="Sub">3</span>, serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span> receptors (K<span class="Sub">i</span> values of 0.34 nM, 0.8 nM, 1.7 nM, and 3.4 nM, respectively), moderate affinity for dopamine D<span class="Sub">4</span>, serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">2C</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">7</span>, alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenergic and histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors (K<span class="Sub">i</span> values of 44 nM, 15 nM, 39 nM, 57 nM, and 61 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake site (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=98 nM). Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC<span class="Sub">50</span>&gt;1000 nM).</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Aripiprazole activity is presumably primarily due to the parent drug, aripiprazole, and to a lesser extent, to its major metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, which has been shown to have affinities for D<span class="Sub">2</span> receptors similar to the parent drug and represents 40% of the parent drug exposure in plasma. The mean elimination half-lives are about 75 hours and 94 hours for aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, respectively. Steady-state concentrations are attained within 14 days of dosing for both active moieties. Aripiprazole accumulation is predictable from single-dose pharmacokinetics. At steady-state, the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole is dose-proportional. Elimination of aripiprazole is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. For CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, the mean elimination half-life for aripiprazole is about 146 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">ORAL ADMINISTRATION</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Tablet</span>: Aripiprazole is well absorbed after administration of the tablet, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3 hours to 5 hours; the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%. Aripiprazole can be administered with or without food. Administration of a 15 mg aripiprazole tablet with a standard high-fat meal did not significantly affect the C<span class="Sub">max</span> or AUC of aripiprazole or its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, but delayed T<span class="Sub">max</span> by 3 hours for aripiprazole and 12 hours for dehydro­-aripiprazole.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>The steady-state volume of distribution of aripiprazole following intravenous administration is high (404 L or 4.9 L/kg), indicating extensive extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and its major metabolite are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, primarily to albumin. In healthy human volunteers administered 0.5 to 30 mg/day aripiprazole for 14 days, there was dose-dependent D2 receptor occupancy indicating brain penetration of aripiprazole in humans.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Elimination</span></p><p>Aripiprazole is metabolized primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant drug moiety in the systemic circulation. At steady-state, dehydro­-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.</p><p>Following a single oral dose of [<span class="Sup">14</span>C]-labeled aripiprazole, approximately 25% and 55% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% of the oral dose was recovered unchanged in the feces.</p><p><span class="Italics">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p>Effects of other drugs on the exposures of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are summarized in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively. Based on simulation, a 4.5-fold increase in mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values at steady-state is expected when extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 are administered with both strong CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors. A 3-fold increase in mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values at steady-state is expected in poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: The effects of other drugs on aripiprazole pharmacokinetics</span></p><p><span class="Bold"></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2: The effects of other drugs on dehydro-aripiprazole pharmacokinetics</span></p><p><span class="Bold"></span></p><p>The effects of aripiprazole on the exposures of other drugs are summarized in Figure 3.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 3: The effects of aripiprazole on pharmacokinetics of other drugs</span></p><p><span class="Italics"></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Studies in Specific Populations</span></p><p>Exposures of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in specific populations are summarized in Figure 4 and Figure 5, respectively.

Aripiprazole was administered for 2 years in the diet at doses of 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day to ICR mice and 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day to F344 rats (0.2, 0.5, 2 and 5 times and 0.3, 1 and 3 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area, respectively). In addition, SD rats were dosed orally for 2 years at 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg/day, which are 3, 6, 13 and 19 times the MRHD based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area. Aripiprazole did not induce tumors in male mice or male rats. In female mice, the incidences of pituitary gland adenomas and mammary gland adenocarcinomas and adenoacanthomas were increased at dietary doses of 3 to 30 mg/kg/day (0.5 to 5 times the MRHD). In female rats, the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas was increased at a dietary dose of 10 mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD); and the incidences of adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas were increased at an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (19 times the MRHD).</p><p>An increase in mammary, pituitary, and endocrine pancreas neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be mediated by prolonged dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptor antagonism and hyperprolactinemia. Serum prolactin was not measured in the aripiprazole carcinogenicity studies. However, increases in serum prolactin levels were observed in female mice in a 13-week dietary study at the doses associated with mammary gland and pituitary tumors. Serum prolactin was not increased in female rats in 4-week and 13-week dietary studies at the dose associated with mammary gland tumors. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unclear.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>The mutagenic potential of aripiprazole was tested in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> bacterial reverse-mutation assay, the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> bacterial DNA repair assay, the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells, the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells, the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus assay in mice, and the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rats. Aripiprazole and a metabolite (2,3-DCPP) were clastogenic in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration assay in CHL cells with and without metabolic activation. The metabolite, 2,3-DCPP, increased numerical aberrations in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assay in CHL cells in the absence of metabolic activation. A positive response was obtained in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus assay in mice; however, the response was due to a mechanism not considered relevant to humans.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Female rats were treated orally with aripiprazole from 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7 at doses of 2, 6, and 20 mg/kg/day, which are 0.6, 2, and 6 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area. Estrus cycle irregularities and increased corpora lutea were seen at all doses, but no impairment of fertility was seen. Increased pre-implantation loss was seen at 2 and 6 times the MRHD, and decreased fetal weight was seen at 6 times the MRHD.</p><p>Male rats were treated orally with aripiprazole from 9 weeks prior to mating through mating at doses of 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg/day, which are 6, 13, and 19 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area. Disturbances in spermatogenesis were seen at 19 times the MRHD and prostate atrophy was seen at 13 and 19 times the MRHD without impairment of fertility.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Aripiprazole produced retinal degeneration in albino rats in a 26-week chronic toxicity study at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day and in a 2-year carcinogenicity study at doses of 40 and 60 mg/kg/day which are 13 and 19 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice and of monkeys did not reveal evidence of retinal degeneration. Additional studies to further evaluate the mechanism have not been performed. The relevance of this finding to human risk is unknown.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Efficacy of the oral formulations of aripiprazole was established in the following adequate and well-controlled trials:</p><ul>
<li>Four short-term trials and one maintenance trial in adult patients and one short-term trial in adolescents (ages 13 to 17) with schizophrenia <span class="Italics">[see clinical studies (14.1)]</span></li>

Four of the five trials were able to distinguish Aripiprazole Tablets from placebo, but one study, the smallest, did not. Three of these studies also included an active control group consisting of either risperidone (one trial) or haloperidol (two trials), but they were not designed to allow for a comparison of aripiprazole and the active comparators.</p><p>In the four positive trials for aripiprazole, four primary measures were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms. Efficacy was evaluated using the total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The PANSS is a 30 item scale that measures positive symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), negative symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items), each rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme); total PANSS scores range from 30 to 210. The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessment reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient.</p><p>In a 4-week trial (n=414) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole (15 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 1 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, and CGI-severity score. In addition, the 15 mg dose was superior to placebo in the PANSS negative subscale.</p><p>In a 4-week trial (n=404) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole (20 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 2 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, PANSS negative subscale, and CGI-severity score.</p><p>In a 6-week trial (n=420) comparing three fixed doses of aripiprazole (10, 15, or 20 mg/day) to placebo, all three doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 3 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, and the PANSS negative subscale.</p><p>In a 6-week trial (n=367) comparing three fixed doses of aripiprazole (2, 5, or 10 mg/day) to placebo, the 10 mg dose of aripiprazole was superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 4 in Table 26), the primary outcome measure of the study. The 2 and 5 mg doses did not demonstrate superiority to placebo on the primary outcome measure.</p><p>Thus, the efficacy of 10, 15, 20, and 30 mg daily doses was established in two studies for each dose. Among these doses, there was no evidence that the higher dose groups offered any advantage over the lowest dose group of these studies.</p><p>An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of age, gender, or race.</p><p>A longer-term trial enrolled 310 inpatients or outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia who were, by history, symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from their antipsychotic medications and randomized to aripiprazole 15 mg/day or placebo for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as CGI-Improvement score of ≥5 (minimally worse), scores ≥5 (moderately severe) on the hostility or uncooperativeness items of the PANSS, or ≥20% increase in the PANSS total score. Patients receiving Aripiprazole Tablets 15 mg/day experienced a significantly longer time to relapse over the subsequent 26 weeks compared to those receiving placebo (Study 5 in Figure 6).</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>The efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia in pediatric patients (13 to 17 years of age) was evaluated in one 6-week, placebo-controlled trial of outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and had a PANSS score ≥70 at baseline. In this trial (n=302) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole (10 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, aripiprazole was titrated starting from 2 mg/day to the target dose in 5 days in the 10 mg/day treatment arm and in 11 days in the 30 mg/day treatment arm. Both doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 6 in Table 26), the primary outcome measure of the study. The 30 mg/day dosage was not shown to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. Although maintenance efficacy in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 26: Schizophrenia Studies</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Number</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment Group</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Primary Efficacy Measure: PANNS</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mean</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Baseline</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Score (SD)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">LS Mean</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Change from</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Baseline (SE)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo subtracted Difference<span class="Sup">*</span> (95% CI)</span></p><p class="First">Study 1</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole Tablets (15 mg/day)<span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">98.5 (17.2)</p><p class="First">-15.5 (2.40)</p><p class="First">-12.6 (-18.9, -6.2)</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole Tablets (30 mg/day) <span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">99 (19.2)</p><p class="First">-11.4 (2.39)</p><p class="First">-8.5 (-14.8, -2.1)</p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p class="First">100.2 (16.5)</p><p class="First">-2.9 (2.36)</p><p class="First">--</p><p class="First">Study 2</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole Tablets (20 mg/day) <span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">92.6 (19.5)</p><p class="First">-14.5 (2.23)</p><p class="First">-9.6 (-15.4, -3.8)</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole Tablets (30 mg/day) <span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">94.2 (18.5)</p><p class="First">-13.9 (2.24)</p><p class="First">-9 (-14.8, -3.1)</p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p class="First">94.3 (18.5)</p><p class="First">-5.0 (2.17)</p><p class="First">--</p><p class="First">Study 3</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole Tablets (10 mg/day) <span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">92.7 (19.5)</p><p class="First">-15.0 (2.38)</p><p class="First">-12.7 (-19, -6.41)</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole Tablets (15 mg/day) <span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">93.2 (21.6)</p><p class="First">-11.7 (2.38)</p><p class="First">-9.4 (-15.71, 3.08)</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole Tablets (20 mg/day) <span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">92.5 (20.9)</p><p class="First">-14.4 (2.45)</p><p class="First">-12.1 (-18.53, 5.68)</p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p class="First">92.3 (21.8)</p><p class="First">-2.3 (2.35)</p><p class="First">--</p><p class="First">Study 4</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole Tablets (2 mg/day)</p><p class="First">90.7 (14.5)</p><p class="First">-8.2 (1.90)</p><p class="First">-2.9 (-8.29, 2.47)</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole Tablets (5 mg/day)</p><p class="First">92.0 (12.6)</p><p class="First">-10.6 (1.93)</p><p class="First">-5.2 (-10.7, 0.19)</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole Tablets (10 mg/day) <span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">90.0 (11.9)</p><p class="First">-11.3 (1.88)</p><p class="First">-5.9 (-11.3, -0.58)</p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p class="First">90.8 (13.3)</p><p class="First">-5.3 (1.97)</p><p class="First">--</p><p class="First">Study 6</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole Tablets (10 mg/day) <span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">93.6 (15.7)</p><p class="First">-26.7 (1.91)</p><p class="First">-5.5 (-10.7, -0.21)</p><p class="First">(Pediatric,</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole Tablets (30 mg/day) <span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">94.0 (16.1)</p><p class="First">-28.6 (1.92)</p><p class="First">-7.4 (-12.7, -2.13)</p><p class="First">13 - 17 years)</p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p class="First">94.6 (15.6)</p><p class="First">-21.2 (1.93)</p><p class="First">--</p><p class="First">SD: standard deviation; SE: standard error; LS Mean: least-squares mean; CI: unadjusted confidence interval.</p><p>*Difference (drug minus placebo) in least-squares mean change from baseline.</p><p><span class="Sup">†</span> Doses statistically significantly superior to placebo.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 6: Kaplan-Meier Estimation of Cumulative Proportion of Patients with Relapse </span><span class="Bold">(Schizophrenia Study 5)</span></p><p><span class="Bold"></span></p><h3>Bipolar Disorder</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">A</span><span class="Bold">dditional pediatric use information is approved for Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc.’s ABILIFY<span class="Sup">®</span> (aripiprazole) product.

Patients were initiated on open-label lithium (0.6 to 1.0 mEq/L) or valproate (50 to 125 μg/mL) at therapeutic serum levels, and remained on stable doses for 2 weeks. At the end of 2 weeks, patients demonstrating inadequate response (Y-MRS total score ≥16 and ≤35% improvement on the Y-MRS total score) to lithium or valproate received aripiprazole with a starting dose of 15 mg/day with the option to increase to 30 mg or reduce to 10 mg as early as day 4, as adjunctive therapy with open-label lithium or valproate. Prior to randomization, patients on the combination of single-blind aripiprazole and lithium or valproate were required to maintain stability (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores ≤12) for 12 consecutive weeks. Three hundred thirty-seven patients were then randomized in a double-blind fashion, to either the same dose of aripiprazole they were on at the end of the stabilization period or placebo plus lithium or valproate and were then monitored for manic, mixed, or depressive relapse for a maximum of 52 weeks. Aripiprazole was superior to placebo on the primary endpoint, time from randomization to relapse to any mood event (Study 8 in Figure 8). A mood event was defined as hospitalization for a manic, mixed, or depressive episode, study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy accompanied by Y-MRS score &gt;16 and/or a MADRS &gt;16, or an SAE of worsening disease accompanied by Y-MRS score &gt;16 and/or a MADRS &gt;16. A total of 68 mood events were observed during the double-blind treatment phase. Twenty-five were from the aripiprazole group and 43 were from the placebo group. The number of observed manic episodes in the aripiprazole group (7) were fewer than that in the placebo group (19), while the number of depressive episodes in the aripiprazole group (14) was similar to that in the placebo group (18). The Kaplan-Meier curves of the time from randomization to relapse to any mood event during the 52-week, double-blind treatment phase for aripiprazole and placebo groups are shown in Figure 8.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 8: Kaplan-Meier Estimation of Cumulative Proportion of Patients with Relapse to Any Mood Event (Bipolar Study 8)</span></p><p></p><p>An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of age and gender; however, there were insufficient numbers of patients in each of the ethnic groups to adequately assess inter-group differences.</p><p><span class="Bold">Additional pediatric use information is approved for Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc.’s ABILIFY<span class="Sup">®</span> (aripiprazole) product.
