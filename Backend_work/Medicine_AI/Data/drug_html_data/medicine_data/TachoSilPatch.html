Do not remove already applied TachoSil.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">TachoSil is a topical fibrin sealant patch consisting of human fibrinogen and human thrombin coated onto an equine collagen sponge. The active side of the patch is yellow in color due to the presence of a colorant riboflavin (E101); and the non-active side is off-white in color.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>Each absorbable TachoSil Patch contains:</p><p><span class="Bold">Per square inch:</span></p><p class="First">Human fibrinogen</p><p class="First">23.2 – 47.7 mg (35.5 mg)</p><p class="First">Human thrombin</p><p class="First">8.4 – 17.4 Units (12.9 U)</p><p><span class="Bold">Per square centimeter:</span></p><p class="First">Human fibrinogen</p><p class="First">3.6 – 7.4 mg (5.5 mg)</p><p class="First">Human thrombin</p><p class="First">1.3 – 2.7 Units (2.0 U)</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Do not use TachoSil for:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Thrombosis</h3><p class="First">Thrombosis can occur if TachoSil is applied intravascularly. Ensure that TachoSil is applied to the surface of cardiac, vascular, or hepatic tissue only.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity or allergic/anaphylactoid reactions may occur with TachoSil. Symptoms associated with allergic anaphylactic reactions include: flush, urticaria, pruritus, nausea, drop in blood pressure, tachycardia or bradycardia, dyspnea, severe hypotension and anaphylactic shock. These reactions may occur in patients receiving TachoSil for the first time or may increase with repetitive applications of TachoSil.</p><h3>Infection</h3><p class="First">Avoid application to contaminated or infected areas of the body, or in the presence of active infection.</p><h3>Adhesions</h3><p class="First">TachoSil contains collagen, which may adhere to bleeding surfaces.</p><p>To prevent the development of tissue adhesions at undesired sites, ensure tissue areas outside the desired application area are adequately cleansed before administration of TachoSil <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>. Events of adhesions to gastrointestinal tissues leading to gastrointestinal obstruction have been reported with use in abdominal surgery carried out in proximity to the bowel.</p><h3>Compression</h3><p class="First">When placing TachoSil into cavities or closed spaces, avoid packing because this may cause compression of underlying tissue.</p><h3>Dislodged Material</h3><p class="First">Use only minimum amount of TachoSil Patches necessary to achieve hemostasis. Do not pack. Theoretically, excess patch material can become dislodged and migrate to other areas of the body. Remove unattached pieces of TachoSil; if medically necessary <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Transmissible Infectious Agents</h3><p class="First">Because the biological components of this product are made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents (e.g., viruses), and theoretically, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) agent and the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. The risk that TachoSil will transmit an infectious agent has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing for the presence of certain virus infections, and by inactivating and removing, certain viruses <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)]</span>. Despite these measures, such products can still potentially transmit disease. There is also the possibility that unknown infectious agents may be present in such products.</p><p>All infections thought by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to Baxter Healthcare Corporation, at telephone number 1-866-888-2472. The physician should discuss the risks and benefits of this product with the patient.</p><p>Some viruses, such as parvovirus B19, are particularly difficult to remove or inactivate at this time. Parvovirus B19 most seriously affects pregnant women (fetal infection); immune-compromised individuals or individuals with an increased erythropoiesis (e.g., hemolytic anemia) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The adverse reactions reported in more than one percent of patients during clinical trials were anemia, nausea and vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, increased white blood cell count, ascites, itching, atrial fibrillation, pleural effusion, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, wound infection, hypophosphatemia, urinary tract infection, and post-procedural bile leakage in hepatic surgery.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular Surgery</span></p><p>In the cardiovascular trial, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were atrial fibrillation and pleural effusion.

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with TachoSil. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It is also not known whether TachoSil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. TachoSil should be administered to pregnant women only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when TachoSil is administered to nursing mothers.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The use of TachoSil has been studied in patients aged one month to 16 years; use in children under the age of one month may be unsafe or ineffective due to small size and limited ability to apply the patch as recommended. Use of TachoSil in the one month to 16 years age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of TachoSil in adults with additional data from two clinical trials, which included 36 pediatric patients at the age of 16 years or younger. The data supports the use of TachoSil for hemostasis in pediatric patients undergoing cardiovascular and hepatic surgery <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials to date included 326 patients older than 65 years of age receiving TachoSil. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between the elderly and younger patients, however, greater susceptibility of some older patients to adverse reactions cannot be ruled out.</p><h2>TachoSil Patch Description</h2><p class="First">TachoSil Fibrin Sealant Patch is a sterile, bioabsorbable combination product comprised of two active substances (human plasma-derived fibrinogen and human plasma-derived thrombin) coated onto a collagen sponge of equine origin. The collagen sponge serves as a flexible and mechanically stable carrier for the active substances to facilitate application of the human fibrinogen and thrombin to the wound surface. The active side of the patch is yellow in color due to the presence of a colorant riboflavin (E101); and the non-active side is off-white in color. Each square inch of the patch contains approximately 35.5 mg of human fibrinogen and 12.9 units of human thrombin. Other inactive ingredients include equine collagen, human albumin, sodium chloride, sodium citrate, and L‑arginine hydrochloride.</p><p>TachoSil is sterilized by gamma irradiation after completion of inner and outer packaging, resulting in a sterile product in a sterile inner package.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Viral Clearance</span></p><p>The active biological substances of TachoSil (human fibrinogen and human thrombin) are manufactured from pooled human plasma collected in facilities in the United States. Human plasma is tested by a Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). NAT testing for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and parvovirus B19 is also performed. Human plasma is also tested for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) and human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 (anti-HIV 1/2).</p><p>The manufacturing procedure for each TachoSil component and final product include processing steps designed to reduce the risk of viral transmission. In particular, the virus clearance steps in the manufacture of human fibrinogen and thrombin include pasteurization, precipitation and adsorption. The virus clearance step in the manufacture of the collagen sponge is the pH treatment.</p><p>The virus clearance capacity of these procedures in the manufacture of fibrinogen, thrombin and collagen sponge has been validated using viruses with a wide range of physicochemical characteristics. These <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> validation studies were conducted using samples from manufacturing intermediates spiked with virus suspensions of known titers followed by further processing under conditions equivalent to those in the respective manufacturing steps. The cumulative virus reduction factors (expressed as log<span class="Sub">10</span>) are shown in <span class="Italics">Table 5</span> for each virus tested.</p><p class="First">Table 5. Cumulative Virus Reduction Factors for the Components of TachoSil</p><p class="First">Cumulative Reduction Factors for Virus Removal/Inactivation of Human Fibrinogen</p><p class="First">Virus Reduction Factors [log<span class="Sub">10</span>]</p><p>A validation study was also conducted to evaluate the capacity for gamma irradiation to inactivate and/or remove viruses in the final TachoSil product. The virus reduction factors (expressed as log<span class="Sub">10</span>) are shown in <span class="Italics">Table 6</span> for each virus tested.</p><p>All infections considered by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported to Baxter <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</p><h2>TachoSil Patch - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of TachoSil is based on the interaction between the active biological substances (human fibrinogen and human thrombin) and the physiology of the fibrin clot formation <span class="Italics">(Fig. 3A)</span>. Upon contact with a bleeding wound surface, the active substances coated onto the equine collagen patch become dissolved and partly diffuse into the wound surface. The subsequent fibrinogen-thrombin reaction initiates the last step in the cascade of biochemical reactions-conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin monomers that further polymerize to form the fibrin clot.</p><p>Hemostasis is achieved when the formed fibrin clot adheres the collagen patch to the wound surface, thus providing a physical barrier to bleeding <span class="Italics">(Fig 3B)</span>. TachoSil exhibits flexibility to accommodate for the physiological movements of tissues and organs and can withstand pressures up to 61.4 hPa (46.1 mmHg).</p><p>Figure 3: Scanning Electron Microscopy Photos of TachoSil</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">A</span>. The side view of the TachoSil Patch shows the coating of the human plasma components anchored to the indentations of the collagen carrier.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">B</span>. The deposition of a fibrin clot formed from fibrinogen and thrombin of the coating results in hemostasis and conglutination of the TachoSil Patch to the wound surface.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of TachoSil or studies to determine the genotoxicity or the effect of TachoSil on fertility have not been performed. An assessment of the carcinogenic potential of TachoSil was completed to demonstrate minimal carcinogenic risk from product use.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">In a study conducted in swine, TachoSil was applied to liver wounds and showed progressive degradation. However, remnants of the TachoSil Patch may remain present for more than 12 months. Histologic examination at 26 and 52 weeks revealed that granulation tissue encapsulates TachoSil remnants and forms a firm capsule around them. Remnants were found in all treated animals after 26 weeks (12/12) and in most animals (6/8) after 52 weeks. No other local reactivity or toxicities were noted.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p class="First">An open-label, multi-center, randomized, parallel-group study comparing TachoSil with comparator (hemostatic fleece without additional active coagulation stimulating compounds) treatment was conducted to evaluate TachoSil for control of bleeding in 119 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass procedure. Of the 119 subjects, 88 (74%) were male and 31 (26%) female. Mean (range) age was 67 (23 to 86) years; subjects older than 65 years constituted 58% of the male and 74% of the female population. All subjects were White/Caucasian.</p><p>In the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population, 59 patients were randomized to treatment with TachoSil and 60 patients were randomized to treatment with the comparator. A larger proportion of patients in the TachoSil treatment group (44/59; 75%) than in the comparator treatment group (20/60; 33%) achieved hemostasis within three minutes, which was a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.0001).</p><p>Fifty-six out of 59 (95%) patients in the TachoSil treatment group achieved hemostasis at six minutes compared to 43 out of 60 (72%) in the comparator treatment group, which also was statistically significant (p=0.0006) <span class="Italics">(see Table 7).</span></p><p class="First">Table 7.

One patient obtained hemostasis eight minutes after treatment application and two subjects failed to achieve satisfactory hemostasis within 10 minutes, which necessitated alternative hemostatic measures.</p><p>The estimated proportion of patients achieving hemostasis within three minutes was 81%, which is considered similar to results seen in the randomized controlled study.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Each TachoSil Patch is packaged individually in a tray with lidding.
