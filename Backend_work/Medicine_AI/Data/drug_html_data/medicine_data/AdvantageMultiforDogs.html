If the dog is already infested with fleas when the first dose of <span class="Italics">Advantage Multi for Dogs</span> is administered, adult fleas on the dog will be killed. However, reinfestation from the emergence of pre-existing pupae in the environment may continue to occur for six weeks or longer after treatment is initiated. Dogs treated with imidacloprid, including those with preexisting flea allergy dermatitis have shown clinical improvement as a direct result of elimination of fleas from the dog.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment and Control of Intestinal Nematode Infections:</span> For the treatment and control of intestinal hookworm infections caused by <span class="Italics">Ancylostoma caninum</span> and <span class="Italics">Uncinaria</span><span class="Italics">stenocephala</span> (adults, immature adults and fourth stage larvae) and roundworm infections caused by <span class="Italics">Toxocara canis</span> (adults and fourth stage larvae), and <span class="Italics">Toxascaris leonina</span> (adults), and whipworm infections caused by <span class="Italics">Trichuris vulpis</span> (adults), <span class="Italics">Advantage Multi for Dogs</span> should be administered once as a single topical dose.</p><h2>ANIMAL SAFETY:</h2><p class="First">In a controlled, double-masked, field safety study, <span class="Italics">Advantage</span><span class="Italics">Multi for Dogs</span> was administered to 128 dogs of various breeds, 3 months to 15 years of age, weighing 4 to 157 pounds. <span class="Italics">Advantage Multi for Dogs</span> was used safely in dogs concomitantly receiving ACE inhibitors, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, antimicrobials, chondroprotectants, corticosteroids, immunotherapeutics, MAO inhibitors, NSAIDs, ophthalmic medications, sympathomimetics, synthetic estrogens, thyroid hormones, and urinary acidifiers. Owners reported the following signs in their dogs after application of <span class="Italics">Advantage Multi</span><span class="Italics">for Dogs</span>: pruritus, flaky/greasy residue at the treatment site, medicinal odor, lethargy, inappetence, and hyperactivity. <span class="Bold">(See ADVERSE REACTIONS.)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Safety Study in Puppies:</span> <span class="Italics">Advantage Multi for Dogs</span> was applied topically at 1, 3 and 5X the recommended dose to 7-week-old Beagle puppies once every 2 weeks for 6 treatments on days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70. Loose stools and diarrhea were observed in all groups, including the controls, throughout the study. Vomiting was seen in one puppy from the 1X treatment group (day 57), in two puppies from the 3X treatment group (days 1 and 79), and in one puppy from the 5X treatment group (day 1). Two puppies each in the 1X, 3X, and 5X groups had decreased appetites within 24 hours post-dosing. One puppy in the 1X treatment group had pruritus for one hour following the fifth treatment. A puppy from the 5X treatment group displayed rapid, difficult breathing from 4 to 8 hours following the second treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dermal Dose Tolerance Study:</span> <span class="Italics">Advantage Multi for Dogs</span> was administered topically to 8-month-old Beagle dogs at 10X the recommended dose once. One dog showed signs of treatment site irritation after application. Two dogs vomited, one at 6 hours and one at 6 days post-treatment. Increased RBC, hemoglobin, activated partial thromboplastin, and direct bilirubin were observed in the treated group. Dogs in the treated group did not gain as much weight as the control group.</p><p><span class="Bold">Safety Study in Heartworm-Positive Dogs:</span> <span class="Italics">Advantage Multi</span><span class="Italics">for Dogs</span> was administered topically at 1 and 5X the recommended dose every 14 days for 3 treatments to dogs with adult heartworm infections and circulating microfilariae. At 5X, one dog was observed vomiting three hours after the second treatment. Hypersensitivity reactions were not seen in the 5X treatment group. Microfilariae counts decreased with treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Oral Safety Study in Beagles:</span> <span class="Italics">Advantage Multi for Dogs</span> was administered once orally at the recommended topical dose to 12 dogs. Six dogs vomited within 1 hour of receiving the test article, 2 of these dogs vomited again at 2 hours, and 1 dog vomited again up to 18 hours post-dosing. One dog exhibited shaking (nervousness) 1 hour post-dosing. Another dog exhibited abnormal neurological signs (circling, ataxia, generalized muscle tremors, and dilated pupils with a slow pupillary light response) starting at 4 hours post-dosing through 18 hours post-dosing. Without treatment, this dog was neurologically normal at 24 hours and had a normal appetite by 48 hours post-dosing. <span class="Bold">(See CONTRAINDICATIONS.)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Dermal Safety Study in Ivermectin-Sensitive Collies:</span><span class="Italics">Advantage Multi for Dogs</span> was administered topically at 3 and 5X the recommended dose every 28 days for 3 treatments to Collies which had been pre-screened for avermectin sensitivity. No clinical abnormalities were observed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Oral Safety Study in Ivermectin-Sensitive Collies:</span> <span class="Italics">Advantage Multi for Dogs</span> was administered orally to 5 pre-screened ivermectin-sensitive Collies. The Collies were asymptomatic after ingesting 10% of the minimum labeled dose. At 40% of the minimum recommended topical dose, 4 of the dogs experienced neurological signs indicative of avermectin toxicity including depression, ataxia, mydriasis, salivation, muscle fasciculation, and coma, and were euthanized. <span class="Bold">(See CONTRAINDICATIONS.)</span></p><h2>STORAGE INFORMATION:</h2><p class="First">Store at temperatures between 4°C (39°F) and 25°C (77°F), avoiding excess heat or cold.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED:</h2><p class="First">Code Applications           Per Package</p><p>08891454                         6 x 0.4 mL tubes</p><p>08891462                         6 x 1.0 mL tubes</p><p>08891470                         6 x 2.5 mL tubes</p><p>08891489                         6 x 4.0 mL tubes</p><p>80560290                         6 x 5.0 mL tubes</p><p class="First">Advantage Multi is protected by one or more of the following U.S. patents: 6,232,328, and 6,001,858.</p><p>08944698, R.4 November 2009</p><p>79623739</p><p>NADA #141-251, Approved by FDA</p><p>Made in Germany</p><p>© 2009 Bayer HealthCare LLC</p><p>Bayer, the Bayer Cross and Advantage Multi are registered trademarks of Bayer.</p><p>Bayer HealthCare LLC<br/>
