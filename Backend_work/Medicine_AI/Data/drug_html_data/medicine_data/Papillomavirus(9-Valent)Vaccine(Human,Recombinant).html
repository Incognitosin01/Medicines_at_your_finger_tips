Do not use if discolored or if contains particulate matter, or if syringe is cracked. Inject the entire dose IM into the deltoid region of the upper arm or higher anterolateral thigh area. Do not mix with other vaccines or injections; separate needles and syringes should be used for each injection (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). To prevent syncope-related injuries, patients should be vaccinated while seated or lying down (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). US law requires that the date of administration, the vaccine manufacturer, lot number of vaccine, Vaccine Information Statement edition date and date it was provided, and the administering person's name, title, and address be recorded.</p><p>For patients at risk of hemorrhage following IM injection, the vaccine should be administered IM if, in the opinion of the physician familiar with the patient's bleeding risk, the vaccine can be administered by this route with reasonable safety. If the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered. A fine needle (≤23-gauge) can be used for the vaccination and firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. The patient should be instructed concerning the risk of hematoma from the injection. Patients on anticoagulant therapy should be considered to have the same bleeding risks and treated as those with clotting factor disorders (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Do not freeze. Protect from light.</p><p>Administer as soon as possible after being removed from refrigeration. HPV 9-valent vaccine can be administered provided total (cumulative multiple excursion) time out of refrigeration (at temperatures between 8°C and 25°C) does not exceed 72 hours. Cumulative multiple excursions between 0°C and 2°C are also permitted as long as the total time between 0°C and 2°C does not exceed 72 hours. These are not, however, recommendations for storage.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Fingolimod: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated). Management: Vaccine efficacy may be reduced. Complete all age-appropriate vaccinations at least 2 weeks prior to starting fingolimod. If vaccinated during fingolimod therapy, revaccinate 2 to 3 months after fingolimod discontinuation.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Immunosuppressants: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated). Management: Complete all age-appropriate vaccinations at least 2 weeks prior to starting an immunosuppressant. If vaccinated less than 2 weeks before starting or during immunosuppressant therapy, revaccinate at least 3 months after immunosuppressant discontinuation.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Siponimod: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated).

Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever); vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with a history of bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia); bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; if the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM injection can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Human papillomavirus infection: There is no evidence that individuals already infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) will be protected; those already infected with 1 or more HPV types were protected from disease caused by the remaining HPV types. Not for the treatment of active disease; will not protect against diseases not caused by HPV vaccine types not included in the vaccine. Does not eliminate the necessity for recommended cervical or anal cancer screenings.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Anticoagulant therapy: Use with caution in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy; bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Consider deferring immunization during periods of severe immunosuppression (eg, patients receiving chemo/radiation therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy [including high-dose corticosteroids]); may have a reduced response to vaccination. In general, household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive all age-appropriate vaccines. Inactivated vaccines should be administered ≥2 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression when feasible; inactivated vaccines administered during chemotherapy should be readministered after immune competence is regained (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p><b><i> Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><p>• Previously vaccinated with Gardasil (quadrivalent): Safety and immunogenicity of Gardasil 9 were assessed in individuals who previously completed a 3-dose vaccination series with Gardasil (quadrivalent). Studies using a mixed regimen of HPV vaccines to assess interchangeability were not performed. Per the ACIP, if the provider does not have available or does not know the HPV product used previously, any gender appropriate product can be used to complete the series (CDC/ACIP [Petrosky 2015]).</p><p>• Yeast: Product may contain yeast.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Use of this vaccine for specific medical and/or other indications (eg, immunocompromising conditions, hepatic or kidney disease, diabetes) is also addressed in the annual ACIP Recommended Immunization Schedules (refer to CDC schedule for detailed information). Specific recommendations for vaccination in immunocompromised patients with asplenia, cancer, HIV infection, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, cochlear implants, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (prior to or after), sickle cell disease, solid organ transplant (prior to or after), or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for chronic conditions are available from the IDSA (Rubin 2014).</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). Vaccination is safe for individuals 27 to 45 years of age; however, consider decreased effectiveness and potential for lower cancer prevention in these older ages (ACS [Saslow 2020]; CDC/ACIP [Meites 2019])).</p><p>• Maximum efficacy: The entire series should be completed for maximum efficacy.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Screening for human papillomavirus is not required prior to vaccination. Monitor for anaphylaxis and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion. Continue recommended anal cancer screening.</p><p>Females: Gynecologic screening exam, papillomavirus test; screening for cervical cancer should continue per current guidelines following vaccination.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Pregnancy testing is not required prior to administration of the vaccine (CDC/ACIP [Petrosky 2015]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Based on available data, an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes has not been observed following inadvertent use in pregnant women. Administration of the vaccine in pregnancy is not recommended. The vaccine series (or completion of the series) should be delayed until pregnancy is completed (CDC/ACIP [Petrosky 2015]).</p><p>A registry has been established for women exposed to the Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine during pregnancy (1-800-986-8999).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to prevent anal cancer, genital warts, and anal growths that may lead to cancer.</p><p>• It is used to prevent these health problems caused by HPV: Cervical cancer; vaginal or vulvar cancer; and cervical, vaginal, or vulvar growths that may lead to cancer.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
