<li><span class="Bold">Thrombin-JMI<span class="Sup">®</span> can cause fatal severe bleeding or thrombosis. Thrombosis may result from the development of antibodies against bovine thrombin. Bleeding may result from the development of antibodies against factor V. These may cross-react with human factor V and lead to its deficiency.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Do not re-expose patients to Thrombin-JMI if there are known or suspected antibodies to bovine thrombin and/or factor V.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Monitor patients for abnormal coagulation laboratory values, bleeding, or thrombosis.</span></li>
</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Thrombin-JMI</h2><p class="First">Thrombin-JMI is topical bovine thrombin indicated to aid hemostasis whenever oozing blood and minor bleeding from capillaries and small venules is accessible and control of bleeding by standard surgical techniques (such as suture, ligature, or cautery) is ineffective or impractical.</p><p>In various types of surgeries, solutions of Thrombin-JMI may be used in conjunction with an Absorbable Gelatin Sponge, USP for hemostasis.</p><h2>Thrombin-JMI Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For topical use on the surface of bleeding tissue only. Do not inject.</span></p><h3>Reconstitution</h3><ul>
<li>For routine use, reconstitute Thrombin-JMI with sterile isotonic saline at a recommended concentration of 1,000 to 2,000 International Units per mL.</li>
<li>Where bleeding is profuse, as from abraded surfaces of liver or spleen, concentrations of 1,000 International Units per mL may be required.</li>
<li>For general use in plastic surgery, dental extractions, skin grafting, etc. solutions containing approximately 100 International Units per mL are frequently used. Prepare intermediate strengths to suit the needs of the case by diluting the contents of the Thrombin-JMI container with an appropriate volume of sterile isotonic saline. Thrombin-JMI can be used in a dry form on oozing surfaces.</li>
<li>In instances where a concentration of approximately 1,000 units per mL is desired, the contents of the vial of sterile isotonic saline diluent may be transferred into the Thrombin-JMI container with a sterile syringe or sterile transfer device.</li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">For use with GEL-FLOW™ NT, reconstitute Thrombin-JMI 5,000 IU powder with 5 mL sterile isotonic saline and use Thrombin-JMI Thrombin solution according to the directions for use in the GEL-FLOW™ NT package insert.</span></li>

<li>Do not inject directly into the circulatory system. Because of its action in the clotting mechanism, Thrombin-JMI can cause extensive intravascular clotting or death.</li>
<li>Do not re-expose patients to Thrombin-JMI if there are known or suspected antibodies to bovine thrombin and/or factor V.</li>
<li>Do not administer to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to Thrombin-JMI, its components and/or to material of bovine origin.</li>
<li>Do not use for treatment of severe or brisk arterial bleeding.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Warning: Severe Bleeding and Thrombosis Complications</span></p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><ul>
<li>Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, have been reported following administration of Thrombin-JMI.</li>
<li>Institute intensive supportive measures and treat individual symptoms. Secure the airway and establish adequate respiratory exchange.</li>
</ul><h3>Thrombosis</h3><p class="First">Thrombin-JMI causes thrombosis if it enters the circulatory system. Apply topically. DO NOT INJECT.</p><h3>Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">Inhibitory antibodies may develop in patients and interfere with hemostasis<span class="Bold">.</span> Monitor patients for abnormal coagulation laboratory values, bleeding, or thrombosis.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 2%) following administration of Thrombin-JMI were: hypersensitivity, bleeding, anemia, post-operative wound infection, thromboembolic events, hypotension, pyrexia, tachycardia and thrombocytopenia.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety assessment of Thrombin-JMI is based primarily on the review of post marketing experience including three (3) randomized controlled clinical trials in which Thrombin-JMI was used as a comparator and one (1) observational study. In these studies, the most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 2%) following administration of Thrombin-JMI were: hypersensitivity, bleeding, anemia, post-operative wound infection, thromboembolic events, hypotension, pyrexia, tachycardia and thrombocytopenia [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14)</span>].</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Thrombin-JMI: anaphylactic reactions, prolonged prothrombin time, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, disseminated intravascular coagulation, factor V deficiency, post-procedural hematoma, swelling and Staphylococcal wound infection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Thrombin-JMI. It is also not known whether Thrombin-JMI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Thrombin-JMI should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">Information is unknown.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Thrombin-JMI is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Thrombin-JMI did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h2>Thrombin-JMI Description</h2><p class="First">Thrombin-JMI, Thrombin, Topical (Bovine), is a protein substance produced through a conversion reaction in which prothrombin of bovine origin is activated by tissue thromboplastin of bovine origin in the presence of calcium chloride. It is supplied as a sterile powder that has been freeze-dried in the final container. Also contained in the preparation are mannitol and sodium chloride. Mannitol is included to make the dried product friable and more readily soluble. The product contains no preservative.</p><p>Thrombin-JMI has been chromatographically purified and further processed by ultrafiltration. Analytical studies demonstrate the current manufacturing process' capability to remove significant amounts of extraneous proteins, and result in a reduction of factor Va light chain content to levels below the limit of detection of semi-quantitative Western Blot assay (&lt;92 ng/mL, when reconstituted as directed). The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.</p><h2>Thrombin-JMI - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Thrombin-JMI requires no intermediate physiological agent for its action. It activates platelets and catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, which are essential steps for clot formation. Failure to clot blood occurs in the case where the primary clotting defect is the absence of fibrinogen itself. The speed with which thrombin clots blood is dependent upon the concentration of both thrombin and fibrinogen.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Thrombin Concentration Study</span></p><p>In a blinded pre-clinical study conducted on a liver lesion model in swine, an inverse dose related response was observed between the visual bleeding scores and the thrombin1 concentration within the absorbable gelatin powder delivery system (GEL-FLOW™ NT) syringe, a device containing 550 mg of absorbable gelatin powder (GELFOAM<span class="Sup">®</span> Powder). Bleeding was assigned scores according to a visual scale, with scores of 0 (no bleeding), 0.5 (ooze), 1 (very slight), 2 (slight), 3 (moderate), and 4 (severe). Scores of 1 and less were considered clinically acceptable. The 770 IU/mL thrombin concentration provided statistically significant lower bleeding scores than either 375 IU/mL or 250 IU/mL thrombin concentrations2 (Table 1). The results of this study showed that higher concentrations of thrombin within the GEL-FLOW™ NT syringe resulted in improved hemostasis as measured by lower bleeding scores.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In a randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial that compared recombinant human thrombin to Thrombin-JMI, 206 patients received Thrombin-JMI and 205 patients received recombinant human thrombin as adjuncts to hemostasis in liver resection, spine, peripheral arterial bypass, and dialysis access surgeries. Four hundred one (401) patients completed the trial. The reported adverse reactions in both treatment groups were: cardiac events (18%), hypersensitivity (17%), other infections (15%), bleeding (11%), postoperative wound infection (10%) and thromboembolic events (5%). Among 200 patients who were evaluated for the presence of antibodies to Thrombin-JMI, 10 patient (5%) were positive at baseline and 43 (21.5%) after treatment. The seroconversion rate in Thrombin-JMI group was 18.4%.</p><p>In another multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial that compared plasma-derived human thrombin to Thrombin-JMI, 152 patients received Thrombin-JMI and 153 patients received human thrombin applied topically to the target bleeding site with a gelatin sponge. Serious adverse reactions (pyrexia and post-procedural hematoma) were reported in two patients receiving Thrombin-JMI. In this study, 16 out of 126 (12.7%) patients who received Thrombin-JMI demonstrated seroconversion for at least one of the four antibodies assayed. The four separate ELISA assays used to detect development of antibodies and the corresponding antibody development rates included: 1) Anti-bovine thrombin 10/126 (7.94%), 2) Anti-bovine factor V/Va 12/126 (9.52%), 3) Anti-human thrombin 3/126 (2.38%) and 4) Anti-human factor V/Va 0/126 (0%).The effect of repeat exposure was evaluated in a third multi-center, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial on 72 patients with diabetic foot ulcers, using a gel prepared with Thrombin-JMI and autologous platelet rich plasma that was applied weekly for 12 weeks. Forty (40) patients were treated with the gel at fourteen (14) sites. Safety parameters were evaluated during the 12 weeks of treatment and the three month follow-up period. No serious adverse reactions related to the gel treatment were reported.</p><p>A total of 554 subjects were enrolled, in a multi-center, open-label, observational study (MOSAIC) conducted to assess the effect of possible exposure to Thrombin-JMI on activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) at 48 hours post-surgery in subjects with likelihood of prior exposure to Thrombin-JMI within the past 4 years. Of the 554 subjects, 550 had undergone surgery and completed the study. A total of 384 subjects undergoing vascular surgeries, neurosurgeries and orthopedic surgeries were exposed to Thrombin-JMI (5,000 international units to 20,000 international units).</p><p>In this study, the impact of exposure to Thrombin-JMI in 78 subjects who were positive for anti-bovine thrombin (aBT) antibodies prior to surgery was compared with 140 subjects who did not have any aBT antibodies and were not exposed to Thrombin-JMI. The study did not meet the pre-specified primary endpoint, a mean change from baseline in aPTT at 48 hours post-surgery. The study was not powered to detect coagulopathy related to an immune response after bovine thrombin use.</p><p>A post hoc analysis was performed in which subjects who underwent surgery were re-assigned to one of four exploratory cohorts based on the presence or absence of pre-surgery anti-bovine factor V/anti-bovine factor V active (aBV/Va) antibodies and whether or not they were administered Thrombin-JMI during the study surgery. Non-inferiority (based on aPTT) was observed in these exploratory cohorts at all-time points of 48 hours, 4 weeks and 8 weeks post-surgery.</p><p>For the primary study cohort (Thrombin-JMI use in subjects with baseline positive aBT or positive aBV/Va), there was a higher incidence of seroconversion from anti human thrombin (aHT) negative at baseline to post-surgery positive compared to the primary reference cohort (no Thrombin-JMI use in subjects with baseline negative aBT or negative aBV/Va). This difference was not present at 48 hours after surgery but was evident at 4 weeks and 8 weeks post-surgery. A similar immunological response with aBT and aBV/Va antibodies was observed following Thrombin-JMI administration.</p><p>Secondary immune responses in patients treated with Thrombin-JMI were evidenced by the generation of anti-bovine and anti-human thrombin and factor V/Va antibodies, consistent with known immunogenicity of topical bovine thrombin.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Not made with natural rubber latex.</p><p>Thrombin-JMI<span class="Sup">®</span> is supplied in the following packages:</p><p>Thrombin-JMI<span class="Sup">®</span> Pump Spray Kit is supplied in the following package:</p><p>Thrombin-JMI<span class="Sup">®</span> Syringe Spray Kit is supplied in the following packages:</p><p>Thrombin-JMI<span class="Sup">®</span> Epistaxis Kit is supplied in the following package:</p><p>Thrombin-JMI<span class="Sup">®</span> is supplied in the Gelfoam-JMI™ Kits:</p><p>Thrombin-JMI<span class="Sup">®</span> 5,000 IU Syringe Spray Kit is supplied in the GEL- FLOW™ Kit:</p><p class="First">Store Thrombin-JMI at 2°C – 25°C (36°F – 77°F).</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">Because Thrombin-JMI may cause the formation of clots in blood vessels if absorbed systemically, advise patients to consult their physician if they experience leg tenderness or swelling, chest pain, shortness of breath, or difficulty speaking or swallowing.</p><p>Manufactured by: GenTrac, Incorporated, Middleton, Wisconsin 53562</p><p>Distributed by Pfizer Inc, New York, New York 10017</p><p>US License No. 977</p><p class="First">LAB-0604-11.0</p><h2>PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL - 5,000 IU Vial Label</h2><p class="First">NDC 60793-315-01</p><p>THROMBIN,<br/>
