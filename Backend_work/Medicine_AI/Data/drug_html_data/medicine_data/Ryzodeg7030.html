Insulin is a hormone that works by lowering levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Insulin aspart is a fast-acting insulin. Insulin degludec is a long-acting insulin. This combination insulin starts to work within 10 to 20 minutes after injection, peaks in about 1 hour, and keeps working for 24 hours or longer.</p><p>Ryzodeg is used to improve blood sugar control in adults with diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Ryzodeg may be used for type 1 or type 2 diabetes.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Ryzodeg if you are having an episode of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).</p><p><b>Never share a Ryzodeg injection pen with another person, even if the needle has been changed.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Ryzodeg if you are allergic to insulin aspart or insulin degludec, or if you are having an episode of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).</p><p>Ryzodeg is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old.</p><p>To make sure Ryzodeg is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>liver or kidney disease;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>low levels of potassium in your blood (hypokalemia); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>diabetic ketoacidosis (call your doctor for treatment).</p>

</ul><p>liver or kidney disease;</p><p>low levels of potassium in your blood (hypokalemia); or</p><p>diabetic ketoacidosis (call your doctor for treatment).</p><p>Tell your doctor if you also take pioglitazone or rosiglitazone (sometimes contained in combinations with glimepiride or metformin). Taking certain oral diabetes medicines while you are using Ryzodeg may increase your risk of serious heart problems.</p><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about using Ryzodeg if you are pregnant. Blood sugar control is very important during pregnancy, and your dose needs may be different during each trimester of pregnancy.</p><p>Ask your doctor about using Ryzodeg if you are breast-feeding a baby. Your dose needs may be different while you are nursing.</p><h2>How should I use Ryzodeg?</h2><p>Use Ryzodeg exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Ryzodeg is injected under the skin. You will be shown how to use injections at home. Do not give yourself Ryzodeg if you do not understand how to use the injection and properly dispose of used needles and syringes.</p><p><b>Ryzodeg must not be given with an insulin pump, or mixed with other insulins.</b></p><p>Ryzodeg is usually given once or twice per day, with any main meal. You may need to use a separate fast-acting insulin at your other meals. Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully.</p><p>Your care provider will show you the best places on your body to inject Ryzodeg. Use a different place each time you give an injection. Do not inject into the same place two times in a row.</p><p>Never share an injection pen with another person, even if the needle has been changed. Sharing these devices can allow infections or disease to pass from one person to another.</p><p>Use a disposable needle only once. Follow any state or local laws about throwing away used needles and syringes. Use a puncture-proof "sharps" disposal container (ask your pharmacist where to get one and how to throw it away). Keep this container out of the reach of children and pets.</p><p>Low blood sugar <b>(hypoglycemia)</b> can happen to everyone who has diabetes. Symptoms include headache, hunger, sweating, irritability, dizziness, nausea, fast heart rate, and feeling anxious or shaky. To quickly treat low blood sugar, always keep a fast-acting source of sugar with you such as fruit juice, hard candy, crackers, raisins, or non-diet soda.</p><p>Your doctor can prescribe a glucagon emergency injection kit to use in case you have severe hypoglycemia and cannot eat or drink. Be sure your family and close friends know how to give you this injection in an emergency.</p><p>Also watch for signs of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) such as increased thirst or urination, blurred vision, headache, and tiredness.</p><p>Blood sugar levels can be affected by stress, illness, surgery, exercise, alcohol use, or skipping meals. <b>Ask your doctor before changing your insulin dose or schedule.</b></p><p>Ryzodeg is only part of a complete treatment program that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, regular blood sugar testing, and special medical care. Follow your doctor's instructions very closely.</p><p>Keep this medicine in its original container protected from heat and light.
