CD20 regulates cell cycle initiation; and, possibly, functions as a calcium channel. Rituximab binds to the antigen on the cell surface, activating complement-dependent B-cell cytotoxicity; and to human Fc receptors, mediating cell killing through an antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.</p><p>Hyaluronidase increases the absorption rate of rituximab-containing products by increasing permeability of subcutaneous tissue through temporary depolymerization of hyaluronan; at the recommended doses, hyaluronidase acts locally and the effects are reversible. Permeability of the subcutaneous tissue is restored within 24 to 48 hours.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>V<sub>dss</sub>: SubQ: 8.52 L (CLL); 8.09 L (FL)</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>CLL: B-cells begin to deplete following the first cycle of rituximab, with 28% of patients B-cell depleted prior to the dose in cycle 2; by cycle 6, 96% of patients were B-cell depleted.</p><p>FL: Peripheral B-cell counts decrease to levels below normal following the first cycle of rituximab and are maintained during treatment with rituximab/hyaluronidase.</p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>CLL: Patients remained B-cell depleted until month 9, where signs of repletion were seen.</p><p>FL: After discontinuing rituximab/hyaluronidase, B-cell repletion begins after 6 months (may be longer in some patients)</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Terminal: 32 days (CLL); 34.1 days (FL)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia:</b> Treatment of adult patients with previously untreated and previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide)</p><p><b>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:</b> Treatment of adult patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens</p><p><b>Follicular lymphoma:</b> Treatment of adult patients with:</p><p>Relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) as a single agent;</p><p>Previously untreated FL (in combination with first-line chemotherapy) and, in patients achieving a complete or partial response to rituximab in combination with chemotherapy (as single-agent maintenance therapy);</p><p>Non-progressing (including stable disease) FL as a single agent after first-line cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy</p><p>Limitations of use: Initiate treatment with rituximab/hyaluronidase only after patients have received at least 1 full dose of a rituximab product by intravenous infusion; rituximab/hyaluronidase is not indicated for the treatment of non-malignant conditions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>There are no contraindications listed in the manufacturer's US labeling.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Known type 1 hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction to murine proteins, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell proteins, or any component of the formulation; patients who have or have had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML); patients with severe, active infections</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note:</b> All patients must receive at least one full dose of intravenous rituximab (without experiencing severe adverse reactions) prior to initiating treatment with subcutaneous rituximab/hyaluronidase; patients who do not tolerate a full IV dose should continue to receive IV rituximab in subsequent cycles.

Discontinue rituximab/hyaluronidase and concomitant medications in the event of HBV reactivation.</p><p>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal PML, can occur in patients receiving rituximab-containing products, including rituximab/hyaluronidase.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p>Concerns related to adverse effects:</p><p>• Bowel obstruction/perforation: Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, and perforation have been reported (rarely fatal) in patients receiving rituximab-containing products, with an average onset of symptoms of ~6 days (range: 1 to 77 days); evaluate abdominal pain or repeated vomiting.</p><p>• Cardiovascular effects: Cardiac events (eg, ventricular fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock) may occur with rituximab-containing products. Discontinue rituximab/hyaluronidase for serious or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Perform cardiac monitoring during and after administration in patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias or who have a history of arrhythmia or angina.</p><p>• Cytopenias: Rituximab is associated with lymphopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia; the duration of cytopenias may be prolonged and may extend months beyond treatment. Monitor blood counts.</p><p>• Hepatitis B virus reactivation:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation may occur with rituximab-containing products, including rituximab/hyaluronidase, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Screen all patients for HBV infection before treatment initiation, and monitor patients during and after treatment with rituximab/hyaluronidase. Discontinue rituximab/hyaluronidase and concomitant medications in the event of HBV reactivation.</b> Screening should include hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc); monitor patients for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis or HBV reactivation during and for several months after treatment. If viral hepatitis develops, initiate appropriate antiviral therapy. Reactivation has occurred in patients who are HBsAg positive as well as in those who are HBsAg negative but are anti-HBc positive; HBV reactivation has also been observed in patients who had previously resolved HBV infection. HBV reactivation has been reported up to 24 months after rituximab discontinuation. Use cautiously in patients who show evidence of prior HBV infection (eg, HBsAg positive [regardless of antibody status] or HBsAG negative but anti-HBc positive); consult with appropriate clinicians regarding monitoring and consideration of antiviral therapy before and/or during rituximab treatment. The safety of resuming rituximab-containing treatment following HBV reactivation is not known; discuss reinitiation of therapy in patients with resolved HBV reactivation with physicians experienced in HBV management.</p><p>- American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) provisional clinical opinion update on hepatitis B virus screening recommendations (Hwang 2015): Patients receiving anti-CD20 antibodies are at high risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation. Screen for HBV infection with HBsAG and anti-HBc tests prior to treatment initiation; either a total anti-HBc (with both IgG and IgM) or anti-HBc IgG test should be used to screen for chronic or resolved HBV infection (do not use anti-HBc IgM as it may only confirm acute HBV infection). In addition, patients who have risk factors for HBV infection (eg, birthplace in a country with ≥2% HBV prevalence, household or sexual contact with HBV infected patients, high-risk behaviors [eg, intravenous drug use], and HIV infection) should also be screened prior to beginning therapy. Initiate prophylactic antiviral therapy (utilizing antivirals with low rates of viral resistance) for HBsAg positive/anti-HBc positive patients (without delaying cancer therapy) and continue the antivirals during and for ~6 to 12 months after completing treatment. HBsAg negative/anti-HBc positive patients should be monitored for HBV reactivation with HBV DNA and ALT testing approximately every 3 months during treatment; antiviral therapy may be initiated prophylactically or begun promptly at the first sign of HBV reactivation.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Rituximab-containing products are associated with hypersensitivity reactions (may be related to cytokine release and/or other chemical mediators). Due to the higher risk of hypersensitivity and other acute reactions, patients must receive at least one full dose of intravenous rituximab prior to receiving subcutaneous rituximab/hyaluronidase. Infusion-related reactions (with the use of intravenous rituximab formulations) usually occur within 30 to 120 minutes and may include hypotension, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypoxia, urticaria, and in more severe cases pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, and/or anaphylactoid events. Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions may occur (typically occur within minutes of infusion initiation); severe cytokine release syndrome may occur within 1 to 2 hours of starting infusion. Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or with pulmonary tumor infiltration may have a poorer outcome. Closely monitor patients with a history of prior cardiopulmonary reactions or with preexisting cardiac or pulmonary conditions and patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (&gt;25,000/mm<sup>3</sup>). Prior to administration, premedicate patients with acetaminophen and an antihistamine (and consider glucocorticoids). Observe patients for at least 15 minutes following subcutaneous administration; increase observation time in patients at higher risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Interrupt rituximab/hyaluronidase administration immediately for signs of a severe reaction; initiate aggressive symptomatic treatment. Medications for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions (eg, bronchodilators, epinephrine, antihistamines, corticosteroids) should be available for immediate use.</p><p>• Infections: Serious and potentially fatal bacterial, fungal, and either new or reactivated viral infections may occur during treatment and after completing therapy with rituximab-containing products. Infections have been observed in patients with prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia, defined as hypogammaglobulinemia &gt;11 months after rituximab exposure. Associated new or reactivated viral infections have included cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis B and C. Discontinue rituximab/hyaluronidase in patients who develop serious infections and initiate appropriate anti-infective treatment.</p><p>• Mucocutaneous and cutaneous reactions: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Severe, including fatal, mucocutaneous reactions may occur in patients receiving rituximab-containing products, including rituximab/hyaluronidase.</b> Paraneoplastic pemphigus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported. Discontinue in patients experiencing severe mucocutaneous skin reactions; the safety of reexposure following mucocutaneous reactions has not been evaluated. Subcutaneous rituximab has been associated with localized cutaneous (and injection site) reactions (eg, pain, erythema, swelling, induration, rash, pruritus, hemorrhage); may occur &gt;24 hours after administration. Reactions have been mostly mild to moderate and have resolved without intervention. Local reactions were most common during the first rituximab/hyaluronidase cycle (incidence decreases with subsequent injections).</p><p>• Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (including fatalities) may occur in patients receiving rituximab-containing products, including rituximab/hyaluronidase.</b> Promptly evaluate any patient presenting with neurological changes; consider neurology consultation, brain MRI and lumbar puncture for suspected PML. Discontinue rituximab/hyaluronidase in patients who develop PML; consider reduction/discontinuation of concurrent chemotherapy or immunosuppressants.</p><p>• Renal toxicity: Rituximab-containing products may cause severe or fatal renal toxicity. Patients who received combination therapy with cisplatin and rituximab for NHL experienced renal toxicity (associated with tumor lysis syndrome) during clinical trials; this combination is not an approved treatment regimen. Renal toxicity also occurred due to tumor lysis syndrome. Monitor for signs of renal failure; discontinue rituximab-containing products with increasing serum creatinine or oliguria.</p><p>• Tumor lysis syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome may occur within 12 to 24 hours after administration of a rituximab-containing product. Hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and/or hyperphosphatemia may occur. Administer prophylaxis (antihyperuricemic therapy, hydration) in patients at high risk (high numbers of circulating malignant cells ≥25,000/mm<sup>3</sup> or high tumor burden). Correct electrolyte abnormalities; monitor renal function and hydration status, and administer supportive care as indicated.</p><p><i><b>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</b></i></p><p>• Immunizations: Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with rituximab; there is no data available concerning secondary transmission of live vaccines with or following rituximab-containing treatment.</p><p><i><b>Dosage form specific issues:</b></i></p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Electrolytes (in patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome [TLS]), CBC with differential; renal function (in patients at risk for TLS), fluid/hydration status balance; BP, vital signs; verify pregnancy status prior to treatment in females of reproductive potential.</p><p>Screen all patients for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection prior to therapy initiation (eg, hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAG] and anti-HBc measurements). In addition, carriers and patients with evidence of current infection or recovery from prior hepatitis B infection should be monitored closely for clinical and laboratory signs of HBV reactivation and/or infection during therapy and for up to 2 years following completion of treatment. HBV screening recommendations (ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [Hwang 2015]): Screen for HBV infection with HBsAG and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) tests prior to treatment initiation; either a total anti-HBc (with both IgG and IgM) or anti-HBc IgG test should be used to screen for chronic or resolved HBV infection (do not use anti-HBc IgM as it may only confirm acute HBV infection). HBsAg negative/anti-HBc positive patients should be monitored for HBV reactivation with HBV DNA and ALT testing approximately every 3 months during treatment.</p><p>Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions (observe for 15 minutes following administration); signs of active hepatitis B infection (during and for up to 12 months after therapy completion); cardiac monitoring during and after infusion (in patients with preexisting cardiac disease or if arrhythmias develop during or after subsequent infusions); monitor for signs/symptoms of bowel obstruction/perforation (abdominal pain, vomiting); signs or symptoms of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (focal neurologic deficits, which may present as hemiparesis, visual field deficits, cognitive impairment, aphasia, ataxia, and/or cranial nerve deficits); signs/symptoms of TLS and/or mucocutaneous or cutaneous skin reactions.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Verify pregnancy status prior to treatment initiation in females of reproductive potential.</p><p>Effective contraception should be used in females of reproductive potential during therapy and for 12 months following the last rituximab/hyaluronidase dose.</p><p>Rituximab/hyaluronidase may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents (eg, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, fludarabine, vincristine); refer to the rituximab, hyaluronidase, and other individual monographs for additional information.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Rituximab crosses the placenta.
