It appears that in many instances, removal of wound debris strengthens humoral defense mechanisms sufficiently to retard proliferation of local pathogens. Balsam Peru is an effective capillary bed stimulant used to increase circulation in the wound site area. Also, Balsam Peru has a mildly bactericidal action. Castor Oil improves epithelialization by reducing premature epithelial desiccation and cornification. Also, it can act as a protective covering and aids in the reduction of pain.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">VASOLEX™ OINTMENT</span> is used to promote wound healing and the treatment of decubitus ulcers, varicose ulcers and dehiscent wounds.</p><h2>USES</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">VASOLEX™ OINTMENT</span> is easy to apply and quickly reduces odors frequently accompanying a decubitus ulcer. The wound may be left open or appropriate dressing applied.
