This speeds up the rate at which the stomach empties into the intestines and may help with nausea.</p><p>Reglan is used for 4 to 12 weeks to treat heartburn caused by gastroesophageal reflux in people who have used other medications without relief.</p><p>Reglan is also used to treat gastroparesis (slow stomach emptying) in people with diabetes, which can cause heartburn and stomach discomfort after meals.</p><p>Reglan may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Do not use Reglan if you've ever had muscle movement problems after using metoclopramide or similar medicines, or if you've had a movement disorder called tardive dyskinesia. You also should not use this medicine if you've had stomach or intestinal problems (a blockage, bleeding, or a hole or tear), epilepsy or other seizure disorder, or an adrenal gland tumor (pheochromocytoma).</p><p><b>NEVER USE METOCLOPRAMIDE IN LARGER AMOUNTS THAN RECOMMENDED, OR FOR LONGER THAN 12 WEEKS.</b> High doses or long-term use can cause a serious movement disorder that may not be reversible. The longer you use metoclopramide, the more likely you are to develop this movement disorder. The risk of this side effect is higher in diabetics and older adults (especially women).</p><p>Before you take Reglan, tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver disease, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, or a history of depression.</p><p>Do not drink alcohol. It can increase some of the side effects of metoclopramide.</p><p>Stop using Reglan and call your doctor at once if you have tremors or uncontrolled muscle movements, fever, stiff muscles, confusion, sweating, fast or uneven heartbeats, rapid breathing, depressed mood, thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself, hallucinations, anxiety, agitation, seizure, or jaundice (yellowing of your skin or eyes).</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Reglan if you are allergic to metoclopramide, or if you have:</p><ul>

Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Reglan should be taken for only 4 to 12 weeks.</p><p><b>NEVER USE REGLAN IN LARGER AMOUNTS THAN RECOMMENDED, OR FOR LONGER THAN 12 WEEKS.</b> High doses or long-term use of metoclopramide can cause a serious movement disorder that may not be reversible. The longer you use metoclopramide, the more likely you are to develop this movement disorder. The risk of this side effect is higher in diabetics and older adults (especially women).</p><p>Reglan is usually taken 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime, or only with meals that usually cause heartburn. Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully.</p><p>Do not use two different forms of metoclopramide (such as tablets and oral syrup) at the same time.</p><p>Store at room temperature in a tightly-closed container, away from moisture and heat. Keep the bottle tightly closed.</p><p>After you stop taking Reglan, you may have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms such as headache, dizziness, or nervousness.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose of Reglan for Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease:</b></p><p>Oral: 10 to 15 mg up to 4 times a day 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime, depending upon symptoms being treated and clinical response. Therapy should not exceed 12 weeks.</p><p><b>Usual Adult Dose of Reglan for Gastroparesis:</b></p><p>During the earliest manifestations of diabetic gastric stasis, oral administration may be initiated. If severe symptoms are present, therapy should begin with IM or IV administration for up to 10 days until symptoms subside at which time the patient can be switched to oral therapy. Since diabetic gastric stasis is often recurrent, therapy should be reinstituted at the earliest manifestation.<br/>
<br/>
Oral: 10 mg 4 times daily, 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime, for 2 to 8 weeks depending on clinical response.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose.
