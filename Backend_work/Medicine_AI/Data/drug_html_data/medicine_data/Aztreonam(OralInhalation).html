Bacteria eventually lyse due to ongoing activity of cell wall autolytic enzymes (autolysins and murein hydrolases), while cell wall assembly is arrested. Monobactam structure makes cross-allergenicity with beta-lactams unlikely.</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Low systemic absorption.</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (10% [compared with 60% to 65% for injection] as unchanged drug).</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>~1 hour (plasma).</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Adults: 2.1 hours.</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>~77%.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Cystic fibrosis:</b> Improve respiratory symptoms in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with pulmonary <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infections.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to aztreonam or any component of the formulation</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Cystic fibrosis:</b> Inhalation (nebulizer): 75 mg 3 times daily (at least 4 hours apart) for 28 days; administer in repeated cycles of 28 days on drug, followed by 28 days off drug. <b>Note:</b> Pretreatment with a bronchodilator is recommended.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Cystic fibrosis </b><i><b>(Pseudomonas aeruginosa)</b></i><b>:</b> Inhalation (nebulizer): Infants ≥3 months, Children, and Adolescents (limited data available in ages &lt;7 years): 75 mg via nebulization 3 times daily (at least 4 hours apart) for 28 days; administer in repeated cycles of 28 days on drug, followed by 28 days off drug (Lahiri 2016; Tiddens 2015; manufacturer's labeling).</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Reconstitute with 1 mL of sterile diluent (saline) immediately prior to use. Squeeze diluent into opened glass vial. Replace rubber stopper and gently swirl vial until contents have completely dissolved.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Administer using only an Altera nebulizer system; <b>administer alone; do not mix with other nebulizer medications</b>. Administer a bronchodilator before administration of aztreonam (short-acting: 15 minutes to 4 hours before; long-acting: 30 minutes to 12 hours before). For patients on multiple inhaled therapies, administer bronchodilator first, then mucolytic, and lastly, aztreonam.</p><p>To administer Cayston, pour reconstituted solution into the handset of the nebulizer system, turn unit on. Place the mouthpiece in the patient’s mouth and encourage to breathe normally through the mouth. Administration time is usually 2 to 3 minutes. Administer doses ≥4 hours apart.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Prior to reconstitution, store at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Once removed from refrigeration, aztreonam and the diluent may be stored at room temperature (up to 25°C [77°F]) for ≤28 days. Protect from light. Use immediately after reconstitution.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>There are no known significant interactions.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>&gt;10%:</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Pharyngolaryngeal pain (12%) </p><p>Respiratory: Cough (54%), nasal congestion (16%), wheezing (16%)</p><p>Miscellaneous: Fever (13%; more common in children)</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Cardiovascular: Chest discomfort (8%)</p><p>Dermatologic: Skin rash (2%)</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain (7%), vomiting (6%)</p><p>Respiratory: Bronchospasm (3%; patients experienced ≥15% reduction in FEV<sub>1</sub>) </p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Arthralgia, facial rash, facial swelling, hypersensitivity reaction, joint swelling, pharyngeal edema </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Beta-lactam allergy: Rare cross-allergenicity to penicillins, cephalosporins, or carbapenems may occur; use with caution in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to beta-lactams.</p><p>• Bronchospasm: May occur following nebulization; administer a bronchodilator prior to treatment.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Compare patient's baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> prior to therapy and the presence of other symptoms when deciding if post-treatment FEV<sub>1</sub> changes (eg, decline) are caused by a pulmonary exacerbation. Reserve use for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with known <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Consider measuring FEV<sub>1</sub> prior to initiation of therapy</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Aztreonam crosses the placenta and reaches the fetal circulation following IV administration; however, peak plasma concentrations following inhalation of aztreonam are significantly less than those observed following aztreonam IV.</p><p>Due to its poor systemic absorption, use of aztreonam inhalation is likely acceptable for the management of cystic fibrosis in pregnant patients with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>(Kroon 2018; Middleton 2019). When required, use may continue during pregnancy (Middleton 2019).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used in some people with cystic fibrosis to make breathing better.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
