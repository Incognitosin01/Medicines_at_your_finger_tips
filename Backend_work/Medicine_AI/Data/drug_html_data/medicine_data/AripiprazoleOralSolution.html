</ul><h2>Aripiprazole Oral Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Schizophrenia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The recommended starting and target dose for aripiprazole is 10 or 15 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Aripiprazole has been systematically evaluated and shown to be effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Dosage increases should generally not be made before 2 weeks, the time needed to achieve steady-state <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p>Maintenance Treatment: Maintenance of efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a trial involving patients with schizophrenia who had been symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from those medications and randomized to either aripiprazole 15 mg/day or placebo, and observed for relapse <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adolescents</span></p><p>The recommended target dose of aripiprazole is 10 mg/day. Aripiprazole was studied in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age with schizophrenia at daily doses of 10 mg and 30 mg. The starting daily dose of the tablet formulation in these patients was 2 mg, which was titrated to 5 mg after 2 days and to the target dose of 10 mg after 2 additional days. Subsequent dose increases should be administered in 5 mg increments. The 30 mg/day dose was not shown to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. Aripiprazole can be administered without regard to meals <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Switching from Other Antipsychotics</span></p><p>There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients with schizophrenia from other antipsychotics to aripiprazole or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients with schizophrenia, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized.</p><h3>Bipolar I Disorder</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Acute Treatment of Manic and Mixed Episodes</span></p><p>Adults: The recommended starting dose in adults is 15 mg given once daily as monotherapy and 10 mg to 15 mg given once daily as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. Aripiprazole can be given without regard to meals. The recommended target dose of aripiprazole is 15 mg/day, as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. The dose may be increased to 30 mg/day based on clinical response. The safety of doses above 30 mg/day has not been evaluated in clinical trials.</p><p>Pediatrics: The recommended starting dose in pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) as monotherapy is 2 mg/day, with titration to 5 mg/day after 2 days, and a target dose of 10 mg/day after 2 additional days. Recommended dosing as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate is the same. Subsequent dose increases, if needed, should be administered in 5 mg/day increments. Aripiprazole can be given without regard to meals <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The recommended starting dose for aripiprazole as adjunctive treatment for patients already taking an antidepressant is 2 to 5 mg/day. The recommended dosage range is 2 to 15 mg/day. Dosage adjustments of up to 5 mg/day should occur gradually, at intervals of no less than 1 week <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.3)]</span>. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment.</p><h3>Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients (6 to 17 years)</span></p><p>The recommended dosage range for the treatment of pediatric patients with irritability associated with autistic disorder is 5 to 15 mg/day.</p><p>Dosing should be initiated at 2 mg/day. The dose should be increased to 5 mg/day, with subsequent increases to 10 mg/day or 15 mg/day if needed. Dose adjustments of up to 5 mg/day should occur gradually, at intervals of no less than 1 week <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.4)]</span>. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment.<br/></p><h3>Tourette’s Disorder</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients (6 to 18 years)</span></p><p>The recommended dosage range for Tourette’s Disorder is 5 to 20 mg/day.</p><p>For patients weighing less than 50 kg, dosing should be initiated at 2 mg/day with a target dose of 5 mg/day after 2 days. The dose can be increased to 10 mg/day in patients who do not achieve optimal control of tics. Dosage adjustments should occur gradually at intervals of no less than 1 week.<br/></p><p>For patients weighing 50 kg or more, dosing should be initiated at 2 mg/day for 2 days, and then increased to 5 mg/day for 5 days, with a target dose of 10 mg/day on day 8. The dose can be increased up to 20 mg/day for patients who do not achieve optimal control of tics. Dosage adjustments should occur gradually in increments of 5 mg/day at intervals of no less than 1 week <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.5)]</span>.<br/></p><p>Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment.<br/></p><h3>Dosage Adjustments for Cytochrome P450 Considerations</h3><p class="First">Dosage adjustments are recommended in patients who are known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP2D6 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers (see Table 2). When the coadministered drug is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dosage should then be adjusted to its original level. When the coadministered CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn, aripiprazole dosage should be reduced to the original level over 1 to 2 weeks. Patients who may be receiving a combination of strong, moderate, and weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 (e.g., a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor or a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor with a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor), the dosing may be reduced to one-quarter (25%) of the usual dose initially and then adjusted to achieve a favorable clinical response.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2:      Dose Adjustments for Aripiprazole in Patients who are known CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers and Patients Taking Concomitant CYP2D6 Inhibitors, 3A4 Inhibitors, and/or CYP3A4 Inducers</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Factors</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">  Dosage Adjustments for Aripiprazole</span></p><p class="First">Known CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers</p><p class="First">  Administer half of usual dose</p><p class="First">Known CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers taking concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin)</p><p class="First">  Administer a quarter of usual dose  </p><p class="First">Strong CYP2D6 (e.g., quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) <span class="Bold">or </span>CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin)</p><p class="First">  Administer half of usual dose</p><p class="First">Strong CYP2D6 <span class="Bold">and</span> CYP3A4 inhibitors</p><p class="First">  Administer a quarter of usual dose</p><p class="First">Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin)</p><p class="First">  Double usual dose over 1 to 2 weeks</p><p>When adjunctive Aripiprazole Oral Solution is administered to patients with major depressive disorder, Aripiprazole Oral Solution should be administered without dosage adjustment as specified in <span class="Italics">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3)</span>.</p><h3>Dosing of Oral Solution</h3><p class="First">The oral solution can be substituted for tablets on a mg-per-mg basis up to the 25 mg dose level.

In the fixed-dose study, there was a statistically significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole. Aripiprazole is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">BOXED WARNING</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults</h3><p class="First">Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term, placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18­-24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p><p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 5.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 5:</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">  Age Range</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated</span></p><p class="First">  &lt;18</p><p>  18-24</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Increases Compared to Placebo</span></p><p>  14 additional cases</p><p>  5 additional cases</p><p class="First">  25-64</p><p>  ≥65</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Decreases Compared to Placebo</span></p><p>  1 fewer case</p><p>  6 fewer cases</p><p>No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.</span></p><p>The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p><p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms.</p><p><span class="Bold">Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for aripiprazole should be written for the smallest quantity of oral solution consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder:</span> A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.</p><p>It should be noted that aripiprazole is not approved for use in treating depression in the pediatric population.</p><h3>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)</h3><p class="First">A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) may occur with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole. Rare cases of NMS occurred during aripiprazole treatment in the worldwide clinical database. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.</p><p>The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.</p><p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.</p><h3>Tardive Dyskinesia</h3><p class="First">A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.</p><p>The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.</p><p>Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and, thereby, may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</p><p>Given these considerations, aripiprazole should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.</p><p>If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on aripiprazole, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with aripiprazole despite the presence of the syndrome.</p><h3>Metabolic Changes</h3><p class="First">Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus</span></p><p>Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with aripiprazole <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1, </span><span class="Italics">6.2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Because aripiprazole was not marketed at the time these studies were performed, it is not known if aripiprazole is associated with this increased risk. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.</p><p>Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing.

After 26 weeks, 32.8% of patients gained ≥7% of their body weight, not adjusted for normal growth. To adjust for normal growth, z-scores were derived (measured in standard deviations [SD]), which normalize for the natural growth of pediatric patients and adolescents by comparisons to age-and gender-matched population standards.

Other compulsive urges, reported less frequently, include: sexual urges, shopping, eating or binge eating, and other impulsive or compulsive behaviors. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or intense gambling urges, compulsive sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be associated with the underlying disorder. In some cases, although not all, urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Compulsive behaviors may result in harm to the patient and others if not recognized. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges.</p><h3>Orthostatic Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Aripiprazole may cause orthostatic hypotension, perhaps due to its α<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenergic receptor antagonism. The incidence of orthostatic hypotension-associated events from short-term, placebo-controlled trials of adult patients on oral aripiprazole (n=2467) included (aripiprazole incidence, placebo incidence) orthostatic hypotension (1%, 0.3%), postural dizziness (0.5%, 0.3%), and syncope (0.5%, 0.4%); of pediatric patients 6 to 18 years of age (n=732) on oral aripiprazole included orthostatic hypotension (0.5%, 0%), postural dizziness (0.4%, 0 %), and syncope (0.2%, 0%) <span class="Italics">[see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>The incidence of a significant orthostatic change in blood pressure (defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure ≥20 mmHg accompanied by an increase in heart rate ≥25 bpm when comparing standing to supine values) for aripiprazole was not meaningfully different from placebo (aripiprazole incidence, placebo incidence): in adult oral aripiprazole-treated patients (4%, 2%), or in pediatric oral aripiprazole-treated patients aged 6 to 18 years (0.4%, 1%).</p><p>Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">DRUG INTERACTIONS </span><span class="Italics">(7.1)</span></span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>Falls</h3><p class="First">Antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.</p><h3>Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including aripiprazole. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.</p><p>Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC/ANC or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of aripiprazole at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.</p><p>Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue aripiprazole in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>) and follow their WBC counts until recovery.</p><h3>Seizures/Convulsions</h3><p class="First">In short-term, placebo-controlled trials, patients with a history of seizures excluded seizures/convulsions occurred in 0.1% (3/2467) of undiagnosed adult patients treated with oral aripiprazole, and in 0.1% (1/732) of pediatric patients (6 to 18 years).  </p><p>As with other antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older.</p><h3>Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment</h3><p class="First">Aripiprazole, like other antipsychotics, may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. For example, in short-term, placebo-controlled trials, somnolence (including sedation) was reported as follows (aripiprazole incidence, placebo incidence): in adult patients (n=2467) treated with oral aripiprazole (11%, 6%), and in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 (n=611) (24%, 6%). Somnolence (including sedation) led to discontinuation in 0.3% (8/2467) of adult patients and 3% (20/732) of pediatric patients (6 to 18 years) on oral aripiprazole in short-term, placebo-controlled trials.   </p><p>Despite the relatively modest increased incidence of these events compared to placebo, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with aripiprazole does not affect them adversely.</p><h3>Body Temperature Regulation</h3><p class="First">Disruption of the body’s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing aripiprazole for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, (e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration) <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">ADVERSE </span><span class="Italics">REACTIONS (6.2)</span></span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>Suicide</h3><p class="First">The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illnesses, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy.

Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of aripiprazole misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drug-seeking behavior).</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">In physical dependence studies in monkeys, withdrawal symptoms were observed upon abrupt cessation of dosing. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">MedDRA terminology has been used to classify the adverse reactions.</p><h3>Human Experience</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials and in postmarketing experience, adverse reactions of deliberate or accidental overdosage with oral aripiprazole have been reported worldwide. These include overdoses with oral aripiprazole alone and in combination with other substances. No fatality was reported with aripiprazole alone. The largest known dose with a known outcome involved acute ingestion of 1260 mg of oral aripiprazole (42 times the maximum recommended daily dose) by a patient who fully recovered. Deliberate or accidental overdosage was also reported in children (age 12 and younger) involving oral aripiprazole ingestions up to 195 mg with no fatalities.</p><p>Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 5% of all overdose cases) reported with oral aripiprazole overdosage (alone or in combination with other substances) include vomiting, somnolence, and tremor. Other clinically important signs and symptoms observed in one or more patients with aripiprazole overdoses (alone or with other substances) include acidosis, aggression, aspartate aminotransferase increased, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, coma, confusional state, convulsion, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, depressed level of consciousness, hypertension, hypokalemia, hypotension, lethargy, loss of consciousness, QRS complex prolonged, QT prolonged, pneumonia aspiration, respiratory arrest, status epilepticus, and tachycardia.</p><h3>Management Overdosage</h3><p class="First">No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with aripiprazole. An electrocardiogram should be obtained in case of overdosage and if QT interval prolongation is present, cardiac monitoring should be instituted. Otherwise, management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.</p><p><span class="Italics">Charcoal:</span> In the event of an overdose of aripiprazole, an early charcoal administration may be useful in partially preventing the absorption of aripiprazole. Administration of 50 g of activated charcoal, one hour after a single 15 mg oral dose of aripiprazole, decreased the mean AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of aripiprazole by 50%.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hemodialysis:</span> Although there is no information on the effect of hemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.</p><h2>Aripiprazole Oral Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Aripiprazole, USP is an atypical antipsychotic drug that is available as, Aripiprazole Oral Solution.

The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">23</span>H<span class="Sub">27</span>Cl<span class="Sub">2</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span> and its molecular weight is 448.38. The chemical structure is:</p><p>Aripiprazole Oral Solution is a clear, colorless to yellow solution with orange-vanilla odor available in a concentration of 1 mg/mL. The inactive ingredients for this solution include edetate disodium, fructose (200 mg per mL), glycerin, malic acid, methylparaben, propylene glycol, propylparaben, purified water, sodium hydroxide, sucrose (400 mg per mL). The oral solution is flavored with orange-vanilla flavor (contains propylene glycol, water, artificial flavors).</p><h2>Aripiprazole Oral Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of aripiprazole in schizophrenia or bipolar mania, is unclear. However, the efficacy of aripiprazole in the listed indications could be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at D<span class="Sub">2</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span> receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span> receptors.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span> and D<span class="Sub">3</span>, serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span> receptors (K<span class="Sub">i</span> values of 0.34 nM, 0.8 nM, 1.7 nM, and 3.4 nM, respectively), moderate affinity for dopamine D<span class="Sub">4</span>, serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">2C</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">7</span>, alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenergic and histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors (K<span class="Sub">i</span> values of 44 nM, 15 nM, 39 nM, 57 nM, and 61 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake site (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=98 nM). Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC<span class="Sub">50</span>&gt;1000 nM).</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Aripiprazole activity is presumably primarily due to the parent drug, aripiprazole, and to a lesser extent, to its major metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, which has been shown to have affinities for D<span class="Sub">2</span> receptors similar to the parent drug and represents 40% of the parent drug exposure in plasma. The mean elimination half-lives are about 75 hours and 94 hours for aripiprazole and dehydro­ aripiprazole, respectively. Steady-state concentrations are attained within 14 days of dosing for both active moieties. Aripiprazole accumulation is predictable from single-dose pharmacokinetics. At steady-state, the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole is dose-proportional. Elimination of aripiprazole is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. For CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, the mean elimination half-life for aripiprazole is about 146 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">ORAL ADMINISTRATION</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Oral Solution</span>: Aripiprazole is well absorbed when administered orally as the solution. At equivalent doses, the plasma concentrations of aripiprazole from the solution were higher than that from the tablet formulation. In a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy subjects, the solution to tablet ratios of geometric mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values were 122% and 114%, respectively <span class="Italics">[see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.6)]</span>. The single-dose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole were linear and dose-proportional between the doses of 5 mg to 30 mg.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>The steady-state volume of distribution of aripiprazole following intravenous administration is high (404 L or 4.9 L/kg), indicating extensive extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and its major metabolite are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, primarily to albumin. In healthy human volunteers administered 0.5 to 30 mg/day aripiprazole for 14 days, there was dose-dependent D<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor occupancy indicating brain penetration of aripiprazole in humans.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Elimination</span></p><p>Aripiprazole is metabolized primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant drug moiety in the systemic circulation. At steady-state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.</p><p>Following a single oral dose of [<span class="Sup">14</span>C]-labeled aripiprazole, approximately 25% and 55% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively.

</ul><h3>Schizophrenia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia was evaluated in five short-term (4-week and 6-week), placebo-controlled trials of acutely relapsed inpatients who predominantly met DSM-III/IV criteria for schizophrenia. Four of the five trials were able to distinguish aripiprazole from placebo, but one study, the smallest, did not. Three of these studies also included an active control group consisting of either risperidone (one trial) or haloperidol (two trials), but they were not designed to allow for a comparison of aripiprazole and the active comparators.</p><p>In the four positive trials for aripiprazole, four primary measures were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms. Efficacy was evaluated using the total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The PANSS is a 30 item scale that measures positive symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), negative symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items), each rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme); total PANSS scores range from 30 to 210. The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessment reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient.</p><p>In a 4-week trial (n=414) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole (15 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 1 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, and CGI-severity score. In addition, the 15 mg dose was superior to placebo in the PANSS negative subscale.</p><p>In a 4-week trial (n=404) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole (20 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 2 Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, PANSS negative subscale, and CGI-severity score.</p><p>In a 6-week trial (n=420) comparing three fixed doses of aripiprazole (10, 15, or 20 mg/day) to placebo, all three doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 3 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, and the PANSS negative subscale.</p><p>In a 6-week trial (n=367) comparing three fixed doses of aripiprazole (2, 5, or 10 mg/day) to placebo, the 10 mg dose of aripiprazole was superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 4 in Table 26), the primary outcome measure of the study. The 2 and 5 mg doses did not demonstrate superiority to placebo on the primary outcome measure.</p><p>Thus, the efficacy of 10, 15, 20, and 30 mg daily doses was established in two studies for each dose. Among these doses, there was no evidence that the higher dose groups offered any advantage over the lowest dose group of these studies.</p><p>An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of age, gender, or race.</p><p>A longer-term trial enrolled 310 inpatients or outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia who were, by history, symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from their antipsychotic medications and randomized to aripiprazole 15 mg/day or placebo for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as CGI-Improvement score of ≥5 (minimally worse), scores ≥5 (moderately severe) on the hostility or uncooperativeness items of the PANSS, or ≥20% increase in the PANSS total score. Patients receiving aripiprazole 15 mg/day experienced a significantly longer time to relapse over the subsequent 26 weeks compared to those receiving placebo (Study 5 in Figure 6).</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>The efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia in pediatric patients (13 to 17 years of age) was evaluated in one 6-week, placebo- controlled trial of outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and had a PANSS score ≥70 at baseline. In this trial (n=302) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole (10 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, aripiprazole was titrated starting from 2 mg/day to the target dose in 5 days in the 10 mg/day treatment arm and in 11 days in the 30 mg/day treatment arm. Both doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 6 in Table 26), the primary outcome measure of the study. The 30 mg/day dosage was not shown to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. Although maintenance efficacy in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 26: Schizophrenia Studies</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study Number</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment Group</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Primary Efficacy Measure: PANSS</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mean Baseline Score (SD)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">LS Mean Change from Baseline (SE)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo-subtracted Difference* (95% CI)</span></p><p class="First">Study 1</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole (15 mg/day)<span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">98.5 (17.2)</p><p class="First">-15.5 (2.40)</p><p class="First">-12.6 (-18.9, -6.2)</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole (30 mg/day)<span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">99.0 (19.2)</p><p class="First">-11.4 (2.39)</p><p class="First">8.5 (-14.8, -2.1)</p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p class="First">100.2 (16.5)</p><p class="First">-2.9 (2.36)</p><p class="First">--</p><p class="First">Study 2</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole (20 mg/day)<span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">92.6 (19.5)</p><p class="First">14.5 (2.23)</p><p class="First">9.6 (-15.4, -3.8)</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole (30 mg/day)<span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">94.2 (18.5)</p><p class="First">-13.9 (2.24)</p><p class="First">-9.0 (-14.8, -3.1)</p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p class="First">94.3 (18.5)</p><p class="First">-5.0 (2.17)</p><p class="First">--</p><p class="First">Study 3</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole (10 mg/day)<span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">92.7 (19.5)</p><p class="First">-15.0 (2.38)</p><p class="First">-12.7 (-19.00, -6.41)</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole (15 mg/day)<span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">93.2 (21.6)</p><p class="First">-11.7 (2.38)</p><p class="First">-9.4 (-15.71, -3.08)</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole (20 mg/day)<span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">92.5 (20.9)</p><p class="First">-14.4 (2.45)</p><p class="First">-12.1 (-18.53, -5.68)</p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p class="First">92.3 (21.8)</p><p class="First">-2.3 (2.35)</p><p class="First">--</p><p class="First">Study 4</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole (2 mg/day)<span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">90.7 (14.5)</p><p class="First">-8.2 (1.90)</p><p class="First">-2.9 (-8.29, 2.47)</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole (5 mg/day)<span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">92.0 (12.6)</p><p class="First">-10.6 (1.93)</p><p class="First">-5.2 (-10.7, 0.19)</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole (10 mg/day)<span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">90.0 (11.9)</p><p class="First">-11.3 (1.88)</p><p class="First">-5.9 (-11.3, -0.58)</p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p class="First">90.8 (13.3)</p><p class="First">-5.3 (1.97)</p><p class="First">--</p><p class="First">Study 6</p><p>(Pediatric 13-17 years)</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole (10 mg/day)<span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">93.6 (15.7)</p><p class="First">-26.7 (1.91)</p><p class="First">-5.5 (-10.7, -0.21)</p><p class="First">Aripiprazole (30 mg/day)<span class="Sup">†</span></p><p class="First">94.0 (16.1)</p><p class="First">-28.6 (1.92)</p><p class="First">-7.4 (-12.7, -2.13)</p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p class="First">94.6 (15.6)</p><p class="First">-21.2 (1.93)</p><p class="First">--</p><p>SD: standard deviation; SE: standard error; LS Mean: least-squares mean; CI: unadjusted confidence interval.</p><p>* Difference (drug minus placebo) in least-squares mean change from baseline.</p><p><span class="Sup">†</span> Doses statistically significantly superior to placebo.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 6: Kaplan-Meier Estimation of Cumulative Proportion of Patients with Relapse (Schizophrenia Study 5)</span></p><p><span class="Bold"></span></p><h3>Bipolar Disorder</h3><p class="First">Acute Treatment of Manic and Mixed Episodes</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Monotherapy</span></p><p>The efficacy of aripiprazole as monotherapy in the acute treatment of manic episodes was established in four 3-week, placebo-controlled trials in hospitalized patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes. These studies included patients with or without psychotic features and two of the studies also included patients with or without a rapid-cycling course.</p><p>The primary instrument used for assessing manic symptoms was the Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS), an 11-item clinician-rated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). A key secondary instrument included the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar (CGI-BP) Scale.</p><p>In the four positive, 3-week, placebo-controlled trials (n=268; n=248; n=480; n=485) which evaluated aripiprazole in a range of 15 mg to 30 mg, once daily (with a starting dose of 30 mg/day in two studies and 15 mg/day in two studies), aripiprazole was superior to placebo in the reduction of Y-MRS total score (Studies 1-4 in Table 27) and CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In the two studies with a starting dose of 15 mg/day, 48% and 44% of patients were on 15 mg/day at endpoint.

At the end of 2 weeks, patients demonstrating inadequate response (Y-MRS total score ≥16 and ≤35% improvement on the Y-MRS total score) to lithium or valproate received aripiprazole with a starting dose of 15 mg/day with the option to increase to 30 mg or reduce to 10 mg as early as day 4, as adjunctive therapy with open-label lithium or valproate. Prior to randomization, patients on the combination of single-blind aripiprazole and lithium or valproate were required to maintain stability (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores ≤12) for 12 consecutive weeks. Three hundred thirty-seven patients were then randomized in a double- blind fashion, to either the same dose of aripiprazole they were on at the end of the stabilization period or placebo plus lithium or valproate and were then monitored for manic, mixed, or depressive relapse for a maximum of 52 weeks. Aripiprazole was superior to placebo on the primary endpoint, time from randomization to relapse to any mood event (Study 8 in Figure 8). A mood event was defined as hospitalization for a manic, mixed, or depressive episode, study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy accompanied by Y-MRS score &gt;16 and/or a MADRS &gt;16, or an SAE of worsening disease accompanied by Y-MRS score &gt;16 and/or a MADRS &gt;16.

The YGTSS is a fully validated scale designed to measure current tic severity. Efficacy was evaluated using two assessment scales: 1) the Total Tic score (TTS) of the YGTSS and 2) the Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Tourette’s Syndrome (CGI-TS), a clinician-determined summary measure that takes into account all available patient information. Over 65% of these patients were under 13 years of age.</p><p>The primary outcome measure in both trials was the change from baseline to endpoint in the TTS of the YGTSS. Ratings for the TTS are made along 5 different dimensions on a scale of 0 to 5 for motor and vocal tics each. Summation of these 10 scores provides a TTS (i.e., 0-50).<br/></p><p>The results of these trials are as follows:<br/></p><p>In the 8-week, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trial, children and adolescents with Tourette’s disorder (n=133), aged 7 to 17 years, were randomized 1:1:1 to low dose aripiprazole, high dose aripiprazole, or placebo. The target doses for the low and high dose aripiprazole groups were based on weight. Patients &lt; 50 kg in the low dose aripiprazole group started at 2 mg per day with a target dose of 5 mg per day after 2 days. Patients ≥ 50 kg in the low dose aripiprazole group, started at 2 mg per day increased to 5 mg per day after 2 days, with a subsequent increase to a target dose of 10 mg per day at day 7. Patients &lt;50 kg in the high dose aripiprazole group started at 2 mg per day increased to 5 mg per day after 2 days, with a subsequent increase to a target dose of 10 mg per day at day 7. Patients ≥ 50 kg in the high dose aripiprazole group, started at 2 mg per day increased to 5 mg per day after 2 days, with a subsequent increase to a dose of 10 mg per day at day 7 and were allowed weekly increases of 5 mg per day up to a target dose 20 mg per day at Day 21. aripiprazole (both high and low dose groups) demonstrated statistically significantly improved scores on the YGTSS TTS (Study 1 in Table 30) and on the CGI-TS scale compared with placebo. The estimated improvements on the YGTSS TTS over the course of the study are displayed in Figure 9.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 9: Least Square Means of Change from Baseline in YGTSS TTS by Week</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(Tourette’s Disorder Study 1)</span></p><p><span class="Bold"></span></p><p>In the 10-week, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose trial in children and adolescents with Tourette’s disorder (n=61), aged 6 to 18 years, patients received daily doses of placebo or ABILIFY, starting at 2 mg/day with increases allowed up to 20 mg/day based on clinical response.
