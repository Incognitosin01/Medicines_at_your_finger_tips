Polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution induces catharsis through strong electrolyte and osmotic effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p>Bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopy</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Gastrointestinal obstruction; bowel perforation; toxic colitis; toxic megacolon; gastric retention; ileus </p><p>Bi-Peglyte [Canadian product]: Hypersensitivity to bisacodyl, polyethylene glycol or any component of the formulation; ileus; gastric retention; GI obstruction; bowel perforation; toxic colitis; toxic megacolon; acute surgical abdomen; appendicitis; rectal bleeding; gastroenteritis; diverticulitis</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Bowel cleansing: </b>Oral: </p><p>Bisacodyl: 5 mg as a single dose. After bowel movement or 6 hours (whichever occurs first), initiate polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution </p><p>Polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution: 8 ounces every 10 minutes until 2 L are consumed</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Fill the container with water to the fill mark; may add flavor packet provided in kit to the solution; no other ingredients should be added to the solution. Shake well. </p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Administer bisacodyl tablet with water; do not chew or crush tablet. Do not take antacids within 1 hour of taking bisacodyl. Rapidly drinking the polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution is preferred to drinking small amount continuously. If severe bloating, distention, or abdominal pain occurs, administration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until symptoms resolve. Oral medications should not be administered within 1 hour of start of therapy.</p><h2>Dietary Considerations</h2><p>Drink only clear liquids the day of and during the bowel preparation; after consuming the solution, avoid drinking large quantities of clear liquids until colonoscopy. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). When polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution is reconstituted, may refrigerate. Use within 48 hours. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Antacids: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Bisacodyl. Antacids may cause the delayed-release bisacodyl tablets to release drug prior to reaching the large intestine.  Gastric irritation and/or cramps may occur. Management: Antacids should not be used within 1 hour before bisacodyl administration.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Bisacodyl: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Polyethylene Glycol-Electrolyte Solution.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Dichlorphenamide: Laxatives may enhance the hypokalemic effect of Dichlorphenamide. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Polyethylene Glycol-Electrolyte Solution: Bisacodyl may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Polyethylene Glycol-Electrolyte Solution. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Senna: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Polyethylene Glycol-Electrolyte Solution.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Sodium Picosulfate: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Polyethylene Glycol-Electrolyte Solution.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>&gt;10%:</p><p>Central nervous system: Malaise (57%)</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal fullness (40%), abdominal cramps (38%), nausea (34%) </p><p>1% to 10%: Gastrointestinal: Vomiting (10%) </p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing and/or case reports: Anaphylaxis, aspiration, asystole, dermatitis, dizziness, dyspnea, esophageal perforation, hypersensitivity reaction, ischemic colitis, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, pulmonary edema, rhinorrhea, seizure (using the 4 L preparation), syncope, urticaria </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b>Concerns related to adverse effects:</b></p><p>• Arrhythmias: Serious arrhythmias have been reported (rarely) with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products. Use with caution in patients who may be at risk of cardiac arrhythmias (eg, patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent MI, unstable angina, CHF, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in these patients.</p><p>• Fluid/electrolyte loss: Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to arrhythmias, seizures, and renal impairment. Advise patients to maintain adequate hydration before, during, and after treatment. If patient becomes dehydrated or experiences significant vomiting after treatment, consider post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN).</p><p>• Ischemic colitis: Cases of ischemic colitis have been reported; development of severe abdominal pain or rectal bleeding should prompt further evaluation.</p><p>• Seizures: Generalized tonic-clonic seizures have occurred in patients with no prior history of seizures when using the large volume (4 L) preparation.  Seizures resolved with the correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.  Use caution in patients taking medications which increase the risk for electrolyte abnormalities (eg, diuretics) and/or patients with pre-existing electrolyte abnormalities.  Evaluation of electrolytes pre- and post-colonoscopy is warranted in this population.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Impaired gag reflex: Observe unconscious or semiconscious patients with impaired gag reflex or those who are otherwise prone to regurgitation or aspiration during administration.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment and/or  in patients taking medications that may adversely affect renal function (eg, diuretics, NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors). Patients with impaired renal function who develop severe vomiting should be closely monitored including measurement of electrolytes.</p><p>• Ulcerative colitis: Use with caution in patients with severe ulcerative colitis.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Evaluate patients with symptoms of bowel obstruction or perforation prior to use. Correct electrolyte abnormalities in patients prior to use. No additional ingredients or flavors (other than the flavor packs provided) should be added to the polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Bowel movements; electrolytes, renal function</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
