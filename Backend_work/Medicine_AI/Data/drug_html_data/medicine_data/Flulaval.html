</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Flulaval</h2><p class="First">Flulaval<span class="Sup">®</span> is indicated for active immunization of adults (18 years of age and older) against influenza disease caused by influenza virus subtypes A and type B contained in the vaccine.</p><p>This indication is based on immune response elicited by Flulaval, and there have been no controlled trials demonstrating a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination with Flulaval <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><h2>Flulaval Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Preparation for Administration</h3><p class="First">Shake the multi-dose vial vigorously each time before withdrawing a dose of vaccine. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered.</p><p>Between uses, return the multi-dose vial to the recommended storage conditions, between 2º and 8ºC (36º and 46ºF). Do not freeze. Discard if the vaccine has been frozen. Once entered, a multi-dose vial, and any residual contents, should be discarded after 28 days.</p><p>It is recommended that small syringes (0.5-mL or 1-mL) be used to minimize any product loss.</p><h3>Recommended Dose and Schedule</h3><p class="First">Flulaval should be administered as a single 0.5-mL injection by the intramuscular route preferably in the region of the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.</p><p>The vaccine should not be injected in the gluteal area or areas where there may be a major nerve trunk. A needle length of ≥1 inch is preferred because needles &lt;1 inch might be of insufficient length to penetrate muscle tissue in certain adults.</p><p>Do not administer this product intravenously, intradermally or subcutaneously.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Flulaval is a suspension available in 5-mL multi-dose vials containing 10 doses.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Do not administer Flulaval to anyone with known systemic hypersensitivity reactions to egg proteins (a vaccine component) or a life-threatening reaction to previous administration of any influenza vaccination <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Guillain-Barré Syndrome</h3><p class="First">If Guillain-Barré syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior influenza vaccine, the decision to give Flulaval should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks.</p><h3>Altered Immunocompetence</h3><p class="First">If Flulaval is administered to immunosuppressed persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the immune response may be lower than in immunocompetent persons.</p><h3>Persons at Risk of Bleeding</h3><p class="First">As with other intramuscular injections, Flulaval should be given with caution in individuals with bleeding disorders such as hemophilia or on anticoagulant therapy to avoid the risk of hematoma following the injection.</p><h3>Preventing and Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions</h3><p class="First">Prior to administration, the healthcare provider should review the patient’s immunization history for possible vaccine sensitivity and previous vaccination-related adverse reactions. Appropriate medical treatment, including epinephrine, and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of the vaccine.</p><h3>Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness</h3><p class="First">Vaccination with Flulaval may not protect all susceptible individuals.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine, and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. As with any vaccine, there is the possibility that broad use of Flulaval could reveal adverse events not observed in clinical trials.</p><p>In clinical trials, the most common (≥10%) local and systemic adverse events were pain, redness, and/or swelling at the injection site, headache, fatigue, myalgia, low grade fever, and malaise.</p><p>Safety information for Flulaval was collected in 2 randomized, controlled clinical trials, one in the United States (IDB707-105) and the second in Canada (SPD707-104). The safety population from these trials includes 1,049 adults 18 years of age and older vaccinated with products representative of the licensed formulation of Flulaval. The US study included subjects 18 to 64 years of age who were randomized to receive Flulaval (N = 721) or a US-licensed trivalent, inactivated influenza virus vaccine (FLUZONE) (N = 279). The Canadian study compared 4 vaccine groups: Flulaval, a similar investigational formulation of Flulaval with reduced thimerosal, and 2 Canadian-licensed trivalent influenza vaccines.</p><p>Among recipients of Flulaval, 56.6% were women; 92.4% of subjects were white, 6.5% black, 2.7% Native American, and 1.0% Asian. In the US study, 74.8% of the recipients of Flulaval were Hispanic/Latino. The mean age of subjects in the US study was 38 years (range 18-64 years) and 19% of subjects were 50 to 64 years of age. In the Canadian study, the mean age was 63 years (range 50-92 years), and 46.6% were 65 years of age and older.</p><p>A series of symptoms and/or findings were specifically solicited by a diary/memory aid used by subjects for at least the day of vaccination and 3 days post-treatment (Table 1). Subjects were actively queried about changes in their health status through 42 days post-vaccination in the US trial, and six months post-vaccination in the Canadian study. In addition, spontaneous reports of adverse events were also collected (Table 2).</p><p class="First">Results &gt;1% reported to nearest whole percent; results &gt;0 but ≤1 reported as 1%.</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">a</span> US-licensed trivalent, inactivated influenza virus vaccine (FLUZONE).</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">b</span> Includes subjects who received Flulaval and a similar investigational formulation of Flulaval with reduced thimerosal.</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">c</span> Fever defined as ≥37.5°C in the US study, and ≥38.0°C in the Canadian study.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">US Trial</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Adults 18 to 64 years of age</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(80% &lt;50 years of age)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Canadian Trial</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Adults 50 years of age and older</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Events</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Flulaval</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 721</span></p><p>%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Comparator Influenza Vaccine<span class="Sup">a</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 279</span></p><p>%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Flulaval<span class="Sup">b</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 328</span></p><p>%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Local</span></p><p class="First">Pain</p><p class="First">24</p><p class="First">31</p><p class="First">21</p><p class="First">Redness</p><p class="First">11</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">14</p><p class="First">Swelling</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Systemic</span></p><p class="First">Headache</p><p class="First">18</p><p class="First">17</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">Fatigue</p><p class="First">17</p><p class="First">15</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">Myalgia</p><p class="First">13</p><p class="First">16</p><p class="First">11</p><p class="First">Fever<span class="Sup">c</span></p><p class="First">11</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">Malaise</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">Sore throat</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">Reddened eyes</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">Cough</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">Chills</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">Chest tightness</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">Facial swelling</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p>Local adverse events occurred with similar frequency in the 2 trials.

The most common events were headache and cough in both studies. These, as well as throat pain, were the only adverse events reported by &gt;1% of subjects in the US trial. The Canadian trial featured a longer safety follow-up (6 months vs. 42 days) and enrolled a population exclusively 50 years of age and older. Therefore, spontaneous adverse event reports were more frequent in this trial. As indicated in Table 2, upper respiratory infection, arthralgia, myalgia, nasopharyngitis, back pain, injection site erythema, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and nasal congestion were each reported by ≥5% of the recipients of Flulaval in the Canadian study.</p><p class="First">Results &gt;1% reported to nearest whole percent; results &gt;0 but ≤1 reported as 1%.</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">a</span> Adverse events in this table were reported spontaneously or in response to queries about changes in health status.</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">b</span> US-licensed trivalent, inactivated influenza virus vaccine (FLUZONE).</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">c</span> Includes subjects who received Flulaval and a similar investigational formulation of Flulaval with reduced thimerosal.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">US Trial</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(safety follow-up 42 days)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Adults 18 to 64 years of age</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(80% &lt;50 years of age)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Canadian Trial</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(safety follow-up 6 months)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Adults 50 years of age and older</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Events</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Flulaval</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 721</span></p><p>%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Comparator Influenza Vaccine<span class="Sup">b</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 279</span></p><p>%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Flulaval<span class="Sup">c</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 328</span></p><p>%</p><p class="First">Headache</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">19</p><p class="First">Cough</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">15</p><p class="First">Pharyngolaryngeal pain</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">12</p><p class="First">Upper respiratory infection</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">Arthralgia</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">8</p><p class="First">Myalgia</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">Nasopharyngitis</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">Back pain</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">Injection site erythema</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">Diarrhea</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">Fatigue</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">Nausea</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">Nasal congestion</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">5</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following additional adverse events have been identified during postapproval use of Flulaval. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their incidence rate or establish a causal relationship to the vaccine. Adverse events described here are included because: a) they represent reactions which are known to occur following immunizations generally or influenza immunizations specifically; b) they are potentially serious; or c) the frequency of reporting.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders:</span> Lymphadenopathy.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Eye Disorders:</span> Conjunctivitis, eye pain, photophobia.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Disorders:</span> Dysphagia, vomiting.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:</span> Chest pain, injection site inflammation, rigors, asthenia, injection site rash, influenza-like symptoms, abnormal gait, injection site bruising, injection site sterile abscess.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Immune System Disorders:</span> Allergic edema of the face, allergic edema of the mouth, anaphylaxis, allergic edema of the throat.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infections and Infestations:</span> Pharyngitis, rhinitis, laryngitis, cellulitis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders:</span> Muscle weakness, back pain, arthritis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nervous System Disorders:</span> Dizziness, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, hypokinesia, tremor, somnolence, syncope, Guillain-Barré syndrome, convulsions/seizures, facial or cranial nerve paralysis, encephalopathy, limb paralysis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Psychiatric Disorders:</span> Insomnia.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders:</span> Dyspnea, dysphonia, bronchospasm, throat tightness.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:</span> Urticaria, localized or generalized rash, pruritus, periorbital edema, sweating.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vascular Disorders:</span> Flushing, pallor.</p><h3>Adverse Events Associated With Influenza Vaccines</h3><p class="First">Anaphylaxis has been reported after administration of Flulaval. Although Flulaval contains only a limited quantity of egg protein, this protein can induce immediate hypersensitivity reactions among persons who have severe egg allergy. Allergic reactions include hives, angioedema, allergic asthma, and systemic anaphylaxis <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span></span>.</p><p>The 1976 swine influenza vaccine was associated with an increased frequency of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Evidence for a causal relation of GBS with subsequent vaccines prepared from other influenza viruses is unclear. If influenza vaccine does pose a risk, it is probably slightly more than 1 additional case/1 million persons vaccinated.</p><p>Neurological disorders temporally associated with influenza vaccination such as encephalopathy, optic neuritis/neuropathy, partial facial paralysis, and brachial plexus neuropathy have been reported.</p><p>Microscopic polyangitis (vasculitis) has been reported temporally associated with influenza vaccination.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Concomitant Administration With Other Vaccines</h3><p class="First">There are no data to assess the concomitant administration of Flulaval with other vaccines. If Flulaval is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine(s), the vaccines should always be administered at different injection sites. Flulaval should not be mixed with any other vaccine in the same syringe or vial.</p><h3>Immunosuppressive Therapies</h3><p class="First">Immunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic drugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune response to Flulaval.</p><h3>Warfarin, Theophylline, and Phenytoin</h3><p class="First">Although it has been reported that influenza vaccination may inhibit the clearance of warfarin, theophylline, and phenytoin, controlled studies have yielded inconsistent results regarding pharmacokinetic interactions between influenza vaccine and these medications. Nevertheless, clinicians should consider the potential for an interaction when Flulaval is administered to persons receiving these drugs.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category B</p><p>A reproductive and developmental toxicity study has been performed in female rats at a dose approximately 56 times the human dose (on a mg/kg basis) and revealed no evidence of impaired female fertility or harm to the fetus due to Flulaval. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Flulaval should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><p>In a reproductive and developmental toxicity study, the effect of Flulaval on embryo-fetal and pre-weaning development was evaluated in pregnant rats. Animals were administered Flulaval by intramuscular injection once prior to gestation, and during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6, 8, 11, and 15), 0.1 mL/rat/occasion (approximately 56-fold excess relative to the projected human dose on a body weight basis). No adverse effects on mating, female fertility, pregnancy, parturition, lactation parameters, and embryo-fetal or pre-weaning development were observed. There were no vaccine-related fetal malformations or other evidence of teratogenesis.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether Flulaval is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Flulaval is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Flulaval in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In the 2 clinical trials, there were 157 subjects who were ≥65 years of age and received Flulaval; 21 of these subjects were ≥75 years of age. Hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibody responses were lower in geriatric subjects than younger subjects after administration of Flulaval. Solicited adverse events were similar in frequency to those reported in younger subjects <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Flulaval Description</h2><p class="First">Flulaval, Influenza Virus Vaccine, for intramuscular injection, is a trivalent, split-virion, inactivated influenza virus vaccine prepared from virus propagated in the allantoic cavity of embryonated hens’ eggs. Each of the influenza virus strains is produced and purified separately. The virus is inactivated with ultraviolet light treatment followed by formaldehyde treatment, purified by centrifugation, and disrupted with sodium deoxycholate.</p><p>Flulaval is a sterile, translucent to whitish opalescent suspension in a phosphate-buffered saline solution that may sediment slightly. The sediment resuspends upon shaking to form a homogeneous suspension. Flulaval has been standardized according to USPHS requirements for the 2010-2011 influenza season and is formulated to contain 45 mcg hemagglutinin per 0.5-mL dose in the recommended ratio of 15 mcg HA of each of the following 3 strains: A/California/7/2009 NYMC X-179A (H1N1), A/Victoria/210/2009 NYMC X-187 (H3N2) (an A/Perth/16/2009-like virus), and B/Brisbane/60/2008. Thimerosal, a mercury derivative, is added as a preservative. Each dose contains 25 mcg mercury. Each dose may also contain residual amounts of egg proteins (≤1 mcg ovalbumin), formaldehyde (≤25 mcg), and sodium deoxycholate (≤50 mcg). Antibiotics are not used in the manufacture of this vaccine.</p><p>The vial stopper does not contain latex.</p><h2>Flulaval - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Influenza illness and its complications follow infection with influenza viruses. Global surveillance of influenza identifies yearly antigenic variants. For example, since 1977, antigenic variants of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) viruses and influenza B viruses have been in global circulation. Specific levels of HI antibody titer post-vaccination with inactivated influenza virus vaccines have not been correlated with protection from influenza illness but the antibody titers have been used as a measure of vaccine activity. In some human challenge studies, antibody titers of ≥1:40 have been associated with protection from influenza illness in up to 50% of subjects.<span class="Sup">1,2</span> Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers little or no protection against another virus. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virological basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual change of one or more new strains in each year’s influenza vaccine. Therefore, inactivated influenza vaccines are standardized to contain the hemagglutinins of strains (i.e., typically 2 type A and 1 type B), representing the influenza viruses likely to circulate in the United States in the upcoming winter.</p><p>Annual revaccination with the current vaccine is recommended because immunity declines during the year after vaccination, and because circulating strains of influenza virus change from year to year.<span class="Sup">3</span></p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Flulaval has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of fertility.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In 2 randomized, active-controlled trials of Flulaval, the immune responses, specifically HI antibody titers to each virus strain in the vaccine, were evaluated in sera obtained 21 days after administration of Flulaval. No controlled trials demonstrating a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination with Flulaval have been performed.</p><p>A 1,000-subject randomized, blinded, and controlled study was performed in the United States in 18- to 64-year-old healthy adults. A total of 721 subjects received Flulaval, and 279 received a US-licensed trivalent, inactivated influenza virus vaccine (FLUZONE); 959 subjects had complete serological data and no major protocol deviations. Among recipients of Flulaval, 57.4% were women. The mean age of recipients of Flulaval was 37.9 years; 80.4% were 18 to 49 years of age and 19.6% were 50 to 64 years of age.</p><p>A second, randomized, blinded, and controlled study which enrolled 658 subjects 50 years of age and older (stratified by age &lt;65 and ≥65 years) was conducted in Canada. This study included elderly persons with medically controlled chronic high-risk diagnoses who were clinically stable. This study compared 4 vaccine groups: Flulaval, a similar investigational formulation of Flulaval with reduced thimerosal, and 2 Canadian-licensed trivalent influenza vaccines. Results from the 2 groups that received Flulaval were submitted in support of the US licensure of Flulaval. Among these 2 groups, 54.9% of subjects were women. The mean age of recipients of Flulaval was 63 years; 53.4% were 50 to 64 years of age and 46.6% were 65 years of age and older.</p><p>For both studies, analysis of the following co-primary endpoints (Table 3) were performed for each HA antigen contained in the vaccine: 1) assessment of the lower bounds of 2-sided 95% confidence intervals for the proportion of subjects with HI antibody titers of ≥1:40 after vaccination, and 2) assessment of the lower bounds of 2-sided 95% confidence intervals for rates of seroconversion (defined as a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination HI antibody titer from pre-vaccination titer ≥1:10, or an increase in titer from &lt;1:10 to ≥1:40). The pre-specified targets for the 2 endpoints varied by study because of age of subjects enrolled. The pre-specified target for endpoint 1) was 70% in the US study and 60% in the Canadian study. For endpoint 2) the pre-specified target was 40% in the US study and 30% in the Canadian study. For the Canadian study, the primary endpoints, as originally designed, were descriptive comparisons of immune response; therefore, a post-hoc analysis of the endpoints, as described above, was performed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">a</span> Results obtained following vaccination with Flulaval manufactured for the 2004–2005 season.</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">b</span> Per Protocol Cohort for immunogenicity included subjects with complete pre- and post-dose HI titer data and no major protocol deviations.</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">c</span> Lower bounds were calculated using Clopper-Pearson method.</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">d</span> Seroconversion = a 4-fold increase post-vaccination in HI antibody titer from pre-vaccination titer ≥1:10, or an increase in titer from &lt;1:10 to ≥1:40.</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">e</span> Includes subjects who received Flulaval and a similar investigational formulation of Flulaval with reduced thimerosal.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">US Trial in Adults 18 to 64 years of age</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">% of Subjects</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(lower bound of 2-sided 95% confidence interval)<span class="Sup">c</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Flulaval</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Primary endpoint met</span></p><p><span class="Bold">post-vaccination</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">N = 692</span></p><p class="First">HI titers ≥1:40 against:</p><p class="First">Pre-vaccination</p><p class="First">Post-vaccination</p><p class="First">A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)</p><p class="First">24.6</p><p class="First">96.5 (94.9)</p><p class="First">Yes</p><p class="First">A/Wyoming/03/03 (H3N2)</p><p class="First">58.7</p><p class="First">98.7 (97.6)</p><p class="First">Yes</p><p class="First">B/Jiangsu/10/03</p><p class="First">5.4</p><p class="First">62.9 (59.1)</p><p class="First">No</p><p class="First">Seroconversion<span class="Sup">d</span> to:</p><p class="First">A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)</p><p class="First">85.6 (82.7)</p><p class="First">Yes</p><p class="First">A/Wyoming/03/03 (H3N2)</p><p class="First">79.3 (76.1)</p><p class="First">Yes</p><p class="First">B/Jiangsu/10/03</p><p class="First">58.4 (54.6)</p><p class="First">Yes</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Canadian Trial in Adults ≥50 years of age</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">% of Subjects</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(lower bound of 2-sided 95% confidence interval)<span class="Sup">c</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Flulaval<span class="Sup">e</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Primary endpoint met</span></p><p><span class="Bold">post-vaccination</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">N = 324</span></p><p class="First">HI titers ≥1:40 against:</p><p class="First">Pre-vaccination</p><p class="First">Post-vaccination</p><p class="First">A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)</p><p class="First">39.5</p><p class="First">86.4 (82.2)</p><p class="First">Yes</p><p class="First">A/Wyoming/03/03 (H3N2)</p><p class="First">67.9</p><p class="First">99.1 (97.3)</p><p class="First">Yes</p><p class="First">B/Jiangsu/10/03</p><p class="First">10.2</p><p class="First">57.1 (51.5)</p><p class="First">No</p><p class="First">Seroconversion<span class="Sup">d</span> to:</p><p class="First">A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)</p><p class="First">44.8 (39.3)</p><p class="First">Yes</p><p class="First">A/Wyoming/03/03 (H3N2)</p><p class="First">69.1 (63.8)</p><p class="First">Yes</p><p class="First">B/Jiangsu/10/03</p><p class="First">49.1 (43.5)</p><p class="First">Yes</p><p>Across both studies, serum HI antibody responses to Flulaval met the pre-specified seroconversion criteria for all 3 virus strains, and also the pre-specified criterion for the proportion of subjects with HI titers ≥1:40 for both influenza A viruses.
