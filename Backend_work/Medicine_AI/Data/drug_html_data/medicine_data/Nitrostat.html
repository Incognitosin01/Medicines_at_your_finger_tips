Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Nitrostat can relieve this pain.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Nitrostat if you are also using medicine to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). <b>Do not take erectile dysfunction medicine (Viagra, Cialis, Levitra and others) while you are taking Nitrostat.</b></p><p>You should not use <b>sublingual</b> Nitrostat if you have severe anemia, increased pressure inside your skull, circulation problems, chest pain that spreads to your jaw or shoulder, or signs of shock (pale skin, suddenly feeling light-headed).</p><p><b>Seek emergency medical attention if you have early symptoms of a heart attack</b> (chest pain or pressure, pain spreading to your jaw or shoulder, sweating, general ill feeling).</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Nitrostat if you are allergic to nitroglycerin, or if you are using medicine to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), such as riociguat (Adempas), sildenafil (Revatio), or tadalafil (Adcirca).</p><p>Do not take erectile dysfunction medicine (Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, Stendra, Staxyn, sildenafil, avanafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) while you are taking Nitrostat. <b>Using erectile dysfunction medicine with this medicine can cause a sudden and serious decrease in blood pressure.</b></p><p>You should not use Nitrostat sublingual tablets if you have:</p><ul>

Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. If you use too much Nitrostat, it might not work as well in controlling your symptoms.</p><p>Nitrostat is usually taken at the first sign of chest pain. Try to rest or stay seated when you take this medicine (may cause dizziness or fainting).</p><p>You may use Nitrostat sublingual tablets within 5 to 10 minutes before an activity you think might cause chest pain. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>The sublingual tablet should be placed under your tongue and allowed to dissolve slowly. Do not chew or swallow it. Do not use more than 3 tablets in 15 minutes.</p><p>Do not rinse or spit any residual Nitrostat <b>powder</b> for 5 minutes after using the medicine.</p><p>Seek emergency medical attention if your chest pain gets worse or lasts more than 5 minutes, especially if you have trouble breathing or feel weak, dizzy, or nauseated, or lightheaded.</p><p>You may feel a slight burning or stinging in your mouth when you use this medicine. This is not a sign of how well the medicine is working. Do not use more just because you do not feel a burning or stinging.</p><p>This medicine can cause unusual results with certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using nitroglycerin.</p><p><b>Keep this medicine on hand at all times. Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely.</b></p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep the <b>tablets</b> in the original glass container, tightly closed when not in use.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Nitrostat is used when needed, you may not be on a dosing schedule. If you are on a schedule, use the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if your next dose is less than 2 hours away. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>An overdose of nitroglycerin can be fatal.</b></p><p>Overdose symptoms may include a severe throbbing headache, confusion, fever, fast or pounding heartbeats, dizziness, vision problems, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, trouble breathing, cold or clammy skin, fainting, and seizures.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What to avoid</h2><p>Nitrostat may impair your thinking or reactions.
