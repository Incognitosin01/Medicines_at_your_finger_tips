Influenza virus can spread from one person to another through small droplets of saliva that are expelled into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also be passed through contact with objects the infected person has touched, such as a door handle or other surfaces.</p><p>Influenza virus nasal vaccine (nasal flu vaccine) is used to prevent infection caused by influenza virus. The vaccine is redeveloped each year to contain specific strains of activated (live) flu virus that are recommended by public health officials for that year.</p><p>Nasal flu vaccine is a "live virus" vaccine. Influenza virus vaccine is also available as an injection (flu shot) which is a "killed virus" vaccine. <b>This medication guide addresses only the nasal form of this vaccine.</b></p><p>Nasal flu vaccine is for use in adults up to 49 years old, and children who are at least 2 years old.</p><p>This vaccine works by exposing you to a small dose of the influenza virus, which helps your body to develop immunity to the disease. This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>Becoming infected with influenza is much more dangerous to your health than receiving this vaccine. Influenza causes thousands of deaths each year, and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations. However, like any medicine, this vaccine can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.</p><p>Like any vaccine, nasal flu vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You may not be able to receive this vaccine if you are allergic to eggs, if you or someone in your household has a weak immune system, if you are under 18 years old and have recently taken aspirin, or if you have a history of breathing problems, heart or kidney problems, diabetes, Guillain-Barre syndrome, or severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You may not be able to receive this vaccine if you are allergic to eggs, or if you have:</p><ul>
