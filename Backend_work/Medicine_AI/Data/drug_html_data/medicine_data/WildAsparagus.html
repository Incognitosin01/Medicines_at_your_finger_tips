A. racemosus is often used in polyherbal formulations, making observed effects in studies difficult to attribute to a single product. Clinical studies are lacking to support any use.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>There are no quality clinical trials to provide dosage recommendations.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Information is lacking.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Lactation</h3><p>Information is lacking. Shatavari is regarded as safe for use during pregnancy and lactation by Ayurvedic practitioners, but the plant is not listed as having "generally recognized as safe" (GRAS) status by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p>Limited studies have been conducted evaluating the galactogogue effect of A. racemosus</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>A. racemosus may interact with drugs dependent on cytochrome P450 (CYP-450) 3A4 enzymes for metabolism.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>Clinical studies and case reports are lacking to provide information regarding adverse effects. The plant is considered safe by Ayurvedic practitioners. At higher than recommended dosages, adverse cardiovascular effects may occur (based on limited animal studies).</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>No data.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Liliaceae (lily)</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>The climbing A. racemosus plant grows wild, reaching 2 m in height, and is cultivated in India and other tropical and subtropical Asian and African countries. It has also been found in the Himalayan Mountains. It is extensively branched with needle-like leaves, and bears fragrant small white flowers and berries. The tuberous roots and rootstock are of primary interest, and the plant is sometimes eaten as a vegetable.Singh 2016, Williamson 2002</p><p>A. racemosus should not be confused with Stemona plants that have similarly shaped tuberous roots.Kumeta 2013 See also the related Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) monograph.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Shatavari is considered one of the more important Ayurvedic medicines, and is included in several multi-ingredient preparations or "rasayanas." It is used in reproductive health; as a galactogogue; in GI conditions (ulcers, dehydration, and diarrhea); for cough, fever, and infections among other conditions; and to promote general wellbeing by increasing cellular vitality and immunity.Dhar 2016, Pandey 2018, Singh 2016, Williamson 2002</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>More than 50 organic compounds have been described.Pandey 2018 Major chemical constituents identified include steroidal saponins, alkaloids, and flavonoids (including quercetin and rutin). Characterization of the steroidal saponins (such as shatavarin and asparanin) have been described based on spectroscopic and spectrometric methods.Sharma 2011, Sharma 2009, Singh 2016</p><p>Presence of the alkaloid asparagamine A in the roots has been debated; previous isolation of asaparagamine A from materials suggested to have originated from A. racemosus was possibly due to misidentification of the plant species.Kumeta 2013, Williamson 2002</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>A. racemosus is often used in polyherbal formulations, making observed effects in studies difficult to attribute to a single product.</p><h3>Cancer</h3><p>In vitro studies in human cancer cell lines and experiments in rodents describe apoptotic and antioxidant activity of A. racemosus root extractBhutani 2010, Karuna 2017, Kongkaneramit 2011, Smita 2017, Verma 2014. Antioxidant activity was also considered to play a role in prevention of isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity in an animal study.Palanisamy 2012 Furthermore, pretreatment of rats with an aqueous root extract of A. racemosus in one study prevented hepatocarcinogenesis,Agrawal 2008 while in another experiment, reductions were observed in viable tumor cell counts.Mitra 2012</p><h3>CNS</h3><p>Studies in rodent models have been conducted to assess effects of A. racemosus on stress and learning and memory, primarily using the methanolic extract of A. racemosus root.Garabadu 2014, Ojha 2010, Singh 2009</p><p>Evaluation of levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and other monoamines suggest a centrally acting mechanism,Garabadu 2014, Krishnamurthy 2013, Ojha 2010, Pahwa 2016, Singh 2009 possibly related to the saponin content of the extract.Meena 2011 In one animal experiment, flumazenil attenuated the effect of A. racemosus extract.Garabadu 2014</p><h3>Diabetes</h3><p>In a study in rats with induced type 2 diabetes, ethanol extracts of A. racemosus roots administered over 28 days decreased serum glucose and increased pancreatic insulin, plasma insulin, liver glycogen, and total oxidant status.Hannan 2012</p><h3>Diuretic effects</h3><p>A diuretic effect, with increased excretion of potassium, phosphate, and chloride, was demonstrated in a study in rats.Kumar 2010</p><h3>Endocrine (estrogen/prolactin) effects</h3><p>Studies in rodents suggest estrogenic effects of A. racemosus extracts on female mammary glands as well as genital organs in adult pregnant rats.Pandey 2018, Singh 2016 Increases in plasma prolactin and milk production have been demonstrated in a study in buffaloes, suggesting a galactopoietic role.Singh 2012</p><p>Limited clinical studies have been published in peer-reviewed literature. One study reported no effect on follicular growth, development, or ovulation with use of shatavari compared with clomiphene citrate.Pandey 2018</p><p>Another clinical study (N=60) evaluated A. racemosus as a galactogogue and reported increases in prolactin in addition to positive findings for secondary outcome measures (satisfaction of the mother regarding the state of lactation and infant well-being and happiness).Gupta 2011</p><h3>Gastric emptying</h3><p>An older, small clinical study (N=8) compared A. racemosus (2 g of powdered root) to metoclopramide (10 mg tablet) with respect to gastric emptying time, with no difference reported.Dalvi 1990</p><h3>Hypercholesterolemia</h3><p>In hypercholesteremic rats fed powdered A. racemosus, lipid profiles were improved and increases in hepatic hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity and bile acid were observed.Visavadiya 2009</p><h3>Immunomodulatory activity</h3><p>In in vitro and animal studies, A. racemosus extracts have demonstrated effects on proinflammatory cytokines and other immune factors (eg, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor [TNF], immunoglobulin G).Pise 2015, Sidiq 2011, Singh 2016, Thakur 2012, Tiwari 2017 Immune stimulation was demonstrated in a study of immunosuppressed animals,Sharma 2011 and proinflammatory cytokines were inhibited in mice with swimming-induced stress.Kanwar 2010 TNF-alpha was inhibited by a liposomal preparation of A. racemosus, with greater anti-inflammatory action at 0.1 mcg/mL than at higher concentrations.Plangsombat 2016</p><h3>Infections</h3><p>In vitro tests and screening studies suggest that A. racemosus possesses antifungal activity, including against Candida and Malassezia yeasts.Onlom 2014, Panghal 2011, Uma 2009 However, screening studies have produced equivocal results for antibacterial effects (possibly dependent on the extraction method), with one study reporting A. racemosus had the least antimicrobial activity against human uropathogens,Narayanan 2011 and another study finding activity against all clinical isolates tested.Panghal 2011 In one screening study, activity in human CD4 T-cell lines infected with HIV was reported for saponins from A. racemosus.Sabde 2011</p><p>Toxicity of A. racemosus to mosquitoes (larvae and adults)Govindarajan 2014 and in leishmanial infections has been reported.Kaur 2014, Sachdeva 2017, Sachdeva 2014</p><h3>Osteoclast inhibition</h3><p>Limited inhibition of osteoclasts has been demonstrated in vitro.Di Pompo 2014</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>There are no quality clinical trials to provide dosage recommendations.</p><p>In an older study, 2 g of powdered A. racemosus root was given to healthy volunteers to evaluate gastric emptying time.Dalvi 1990 In a small study evaluating effects on lactation, lactating mothers received 60 mg/kg/day of A. racemosus root powder orally for 30 days.Gupta 2011</p><p>Higher than product-specified doses should be avoided due to the potential for cardiac effects.Singh 2016</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Information is lacking. Shatavari is regarded as safe for use during pregnancy and lactation by Ayurvedic practitioners,Singh 2016 but the plant is not listed as having GRAS status by the FDA.Forinash 2012 In rats, teratogenic effects have been reported for the methanol extract.Singh 2016</p><p>Limited studies have been conducted evaluating the galactogogue effect of A. racemosus.Gupta 2011, Sharma 1996</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>Case reports of interactions are lacking. An in vitro experiment suggests the possibility of interactions with drugs dependent on CYP3A4 metabolic pathways.Patil 2014</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Clinical studies and case reports are lacking to provide information regarding adverse effects. The plant is considered safe by Ayurvedic practitioners.Singh 2016 In frogs, an alcoholic extract was reported to have positive ionotropic and chronotropic effects, with cardiac arrest occurring with high doses.Singh 2016</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Studies in rats suggest dosages of 3,200 mg/kg of aqueous extract of the roots is nonlethal. Subacute, long-term toxicity studies show no changes in physiological or biological measures in rats.Kumar 2010, Singh 2016 In rats, teratogenic effects have been reported for the methanol extract.Singh 2016</p><h2>Index Terms</h2><ul><li>Asparagus</li><li>Shatavarin</li></ul><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
