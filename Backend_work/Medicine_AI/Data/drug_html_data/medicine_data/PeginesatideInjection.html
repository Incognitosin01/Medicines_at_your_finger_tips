In clinical studies, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) had a greater risk for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target Hb levels of 11 g/dL or higher. No trial has identified a Hb target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Therefore, in patients with CKD, use the lowest sufficient dose to reduce the need for RBC transfusion .</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Erythropoietic</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>
