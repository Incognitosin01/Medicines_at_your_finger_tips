</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Taclonex Topical Suspension</h2><p class="First">Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Suspension is indicated for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis of the scalp and body in patients 12 years and older.</p><h2>Taclonex Topical Suspension Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Instruct patients to shake bottle prior to using Taclonex Topical Suspension. Apply Taclonex Topical Suspension to affected areas on the scalp and body once daily for up to 8 weeks. Taclonex Topical Suspension should be discontinued when control is achieved. Instruct patients to wash their hands after applying the product. Inform patients that they should not take a bath or shower or wash their hair right after application of Taclonex Topical Suspension.</p><p>Patients 12 to 17 years should not use more than 60 grams per week and patients 18 years and older should not use more than 100 grams per week.</p><p>Taclonex Topical Suspension should <span class="Bold Underline">not</span> be:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Used with occlusive dressings unless directed by a healthcare provider.</li>
<li>Used on the face, groin, or axillae, or if skin atrophy is present at the treatment site.</li>
<li>Applied to the scalp in the 12 hours before or after any chemical treatments to the hair.</li>
</ul><p>Taclonex Topical Suspension is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Topical Suspension: 0.005%/0.064% - each gram contains 50 mcg of calcipotriene and 0.643 mg of betamethasone dipropionate in a viscous, nearly odorless, almost clear, colorless to slightly off-white suspension.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypercalcemia and Hypercalciuria</h3><p class="First">Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed with use of Taclonex Topical Suspension. If hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria develop, discontinue treatment until parameters of calcium metabolism have normalized. The incidence of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria following Taclonex Topical Suspension treatment of more than 8 weeks has not been evaluated <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><h3>Effects on Endocrine System</h3><p class="First">Taclonex Topical Suspension can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age.</p><p>Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw Taclonex Topical Suspension, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid.</p><p>The following trials evaluated the effects of Taclonex Topical Suspension on HPA axis suppression:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>In a trial evaluating the effects of Taclonex Topical Suspension and Taclonex Ointment on the HPA axis, 32 adult subjects applied both Taclonex Topical Suspension on the scalp and Taclonex Ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression was identified in 5 of 32 subjects (16%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in 2 of 11 subjects (18%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks. In another trial, 36 adult subjects applied Taclonex Topical Suspension on the body and scalp and 7 subjects applied Taclonex Topical Suspension on the body. Adrenal suppression occurred in 3 out of 43 subjects (7%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in none of the 36 subjects who continued treatment for 8 weeks [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</span>].</li>
<li>In two trials, the effects of Taclonex Topical Suspension on the HPA axis were evaluated in 31 and 30 pediatric subjects aged 12 to 17 years old who applied Taclonex Topical Suspension on the scalp and the scalp/body, respectively. Adrenal suppression occurred in 1 of 30 evaluable subjects (3%) after 4 weeks of treatment (scalp) and 5 of 31 evaluable subjects (16%) after up to 8 weeks of treatment (scalp and body) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cushing's Syndrome and Hyperglycemia</span></p><p>Cushing's syndrome and hyperglycemia may occur due to the systemic effects of the topical corticosteroid. These complications are rare and generally occur after prolonged exposure to excessively large doses, especially of high-potency topical corticosteroids.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Additional Considerations for Endocrine Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><p>Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure.</p><h3>Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids</h3><p class="First">Allergic contact dermatitis to a topical corticosteroid is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.</p><h3>Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Calcipotriene</h3><p class="First">Allergic contact dermatitis has been observed with use of topical calcipotriene. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.</p><h3>Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Use of topical corticosteroids, including Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Suspension, may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported with the postmarketing use of topical corticosteroid products <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span> Avoid contact of Taclonex Topical Suspension with eyes. Taclonex Topical Suspension may cause eye irritation. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Trials Conducted in Subjects 18 years and older with Psoriasis of the Scalp</span></p><p>The rates of adverse reactions described below were from randomized, multicenter, vehicle- and/or active controlled clinical trials in adult subjects with psoriasis of the scalp <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span> Subjects applied study product once daily for 8 weeks, and the median weekly dose was 12.6 grams.</p><p>Adverse reactions that occurred in <span class="Bold">≥</span>1% of subjects treated with Taclonex Topical Suspension and at a rate higher than in subjects treated with vehicle are presented in Table 1.</p><p>Other less common adverse reactions (&lt;1% but &gt;0.1%) were, in decreasing order of incidence: acne, exacerbation of psoriasis, eye irritation, and pustular rash.</p><p>In a 52-week trial, adverse reactions that were reported by &gt;1% of subjects treated with Taclonex Topical Suspension were pruritus (3.6%), psoriasis (2.4%), erythema (2.1%), skin irritation (1.4%), and folliculitis (1.2%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Trials Conducted in Subjects 18 years and older with Psoriasis of the Body</span></p><p>In randomized, multicenter, vehicle- and/or active controlled clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis on non-scalp areas, 824 subjects applied Taclonex Topical Suspension once daily for 8 weeks <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span> The median weekly dose was 22.6 grams.</p><p>There were no adverse reactions that occurred in ≥1% of subjects treated with Taclonex Topical Suspension and at a rate higher than in subjects treated with vehicle. Other less common adverse reactions (&lt;1% but &gt;0.1%) were, in decreasing order of incidence: rash and folliculitis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Trials Conducted in Subjects 12 to 17 years with Psoriasis of the Scalp</span></p><p>In two uncontrolled clinical trials, 109 subjects aged 12 to 17 years with plaque psoriasis of the scalp applied Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Suspension once daily for up to 8 weeks. The median weekly dose was 40 grams. Adverse reactions included acne, acneiform dermatitis and application site pruritus (0.9% each) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Trial Conducted in Subjects 12 to 17 years with Psoriasis of the Scalp and Body</span></p><p>In an uncontrolled clinical trial, 107 subjects aged 12 to 17 years with plaque psoriasis of the scalp and body applied Taclonex Topical Suspension once daily for up to 8 weeks. The median weekly dose was 26.6 grams. Adverse reactions were folliculitis, acne, and erythema (0.9% each) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">Because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Postmarketing reports for local adverse reactions to topical corticosteroids included atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, itching, dryness, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria.</p><p>Ophthalmic adverse reactions of cataracts, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and central serous chorioretinopathy have been reported during use of topical corticosteroids, including topical betamethasone products.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available data with Taclonex Topical Suspension are not sufficient to evaluate a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Although there are no available data on use of the calcipotriene component in pregnant women, systemic exposure to calcipotriene after topical administration of Taclonex Topical Suspension is likely to be low <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>Observational studies suggest an increased risk of having low birth weight infants with the maternal use of potent or super potent topical corticosteroids (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>). Advise pregnant women that Taclonex Topical Suspension may increase the potential risk of having a low birth weight infant and to use Taclonex Topical Suspension on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>). Oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis had no apparent effects on embryo-fetal development. Subcutaneous administration of betamethasone dipropionate to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, and fetal malformations (cleft palate and crooked or short tail) (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>). The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposures of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate observed in animal studies to the systemic exposures that would be expected in humans after topical use of Taclonex Topical Suspension.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Available observational studies in pregnant women did not identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, preterm delivery, or fetal mortality with the use of topical corticosteroids of any potency. However, when the dispensed amount of potent or super potent topical corticosteroids exceeded 300 grams during the entire pregnancy, maternal use was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight in infants.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Embryo-fetal development studies with calcipotriene were performed by the oral route in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats received dosages of 0, 6, 18, or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively) on days 6-15 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). There were no apparent effects on maternal survival, behavior, or body weight gain, no effects on litter parameters, and no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses. Fetuses from dams dosed at 54 mcg/kg/day exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs.</p><p>Pregnant rabbits were dosed daily with calcipotriene at exposures of 0, 4, 12, or 36 mcg/kg/day (0, 48, 144, and 432 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively) on days 6-18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Mean maternal body weight gain was reduced in animals dosed at 12 or 36 mcg/kg/day. The incidence of fetal deaths was increased in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day; reduced fetal weight was also observed in this group. The incidence of major malformations among fetuses was not affected. An increase in the incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including incomplete ossification of sternebrae, pubic bones, and forelimb phalanges, was observed in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day.</p><p>Embryo-fetal development studies with betamethasone dipropionate were performed via subcutaneous injection in mice and rabbits. Pregnant mice were administered doses of 0, 156, 625, or 2500 mcg/kg/day (0, 468, 1875, and 7500 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively) on days 7 through 13 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, malformations (increased incidence of the cleft palate and crooked or short tail), and minor skeletal abnormalities (delayed ossification of vertebra and sternebrae). Fetal toxicity was observed at the lowest exposure that was evaluated (156 mcg/kg/day).</p><p>Pregnant rabbits were injected subcutaneously at dosages of 0, 0.625, 2.5, and 10 mcg/kg/day (0, 7.5, 30, and 120 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively) on days 6 through 18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, external malformations (including malformed ears, cleft palate, umbilical hernia, kinked tail, club foot, and club hand), and skeletal malformations (including absence of phalanges of the first digit and cranial dysplasia) at dosages of 2.5 mcg/kg/day and above.</p><p>Calcipotriene was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 6, 18 or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively) from gestation day 15 through day 20 postpartum. No remarkable effects were observed on any parameter, including survival, behavior, body weight, litter parameters, or the ability to nurse or rear pups.</p><p>Betamethasone dipropionate was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day (0, 600, 1800, and 6000 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively) from gestation day 6 through day 20 postpartum. Mean maternal body weight was significantly reduced on gestation day 20 in animals dosed at 300 and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean duration of gestation was slightly, but statistically significantly, increased at 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean percentage of pups that survived to day 4 was reduced in relation to dosage. On lactation day 5, the percentage of pups with a reflex to right themselves when placed on their back was significantly reduced at 1000 mcg/kg/day. No effects on the ability of pups to learn were observed, and the ability of the offspring of treated rats to reproduce was not affected.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of topically administered calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Concentrations of calcipotriene in plasma are low after topical administration, and therefore, concentrations in human milk are likely to be low [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> It is not known whether topical administration of large amounts of betamethasone dipropionate could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations).</span> The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Suspension and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Taclonex Topical Suspension or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use Taclonex Topical Suspension on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply Taclonex Topical Suspension directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Taclonex Topical Suspension for the treatment of plaque psoriasis of the scalp and body have been established in pediatric patients age 12 to 17 years. The use of Taclonex Topical Suspension for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and from three uncontrolled trials in pediatric subjects that enrolled 109 adolescents with moderate psoriasis of the scalp and 107 adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and body. After 4 weeks of once daily treatment with Taclonex Topical Suspension, HPA axis suppression was observed in 3% of adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and 16% of adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and body. Calcium metabolism was evaluated in 107 adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and body treated with Taclonex Topical Suspension and no cases of hypercalcemia or clinically relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><p>Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical corticosteroids. Pediatric patients are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency with the use of topical corticosteroids including Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Suspension <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><p>Rare systemic toxicities such as Cushing's syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids. Local adverse reactions including striae have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of Taclonex Topical Suspension in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Taclonex Topical Suspension in plaque psoriasis on non-scalp areas included 124 subjects who were 65 years of age or older, and 36 were 75 years of age or older. Clinical studies of Taclonex Topical Suspension in subjects with psoriasis of the scalp included 334 subjects who were 65 years or older and 84 subjects who were 75 years or older.</p><p>No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of Taclonex Topical Suspension were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified any differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><h2>Taclonex Topical Suspension Description</h2><p class="First">Taclonex Topical Suspension contains calcipotriene hydrate and betamethasone dipropionate.

MC1080 is slowly metabolized to calcitroic acid.</p><p><span class="Italics">Betamethasone dipropionate</span>: Betamethasone dipropionate is metabolized to betamethasone 17-propionate and betamethasone, including the 6β-hydroxy derivatives of those compounds by hydrolysis. Betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) is the primary metabolite.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">When calcipotriene was applied topically to mice for up to 24 months at dosages of 3, 10, and 30 mcg/kg/day (9, 30, and 90 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control.</p><p>A 104-week oral carcinogenicity study was conducted with calcipotriene in male and female rats at doses of 1, 5 and 15 mcg/kg/day (6, 30, and 90 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively). Beginning week 71, the dosage for high-dose animals of both genders was reduced to 10 mcg/kg/day (60 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day). A treatment-related increase in benign C-cell adenomas was observed in the thyroid of females that received 15 mcg/kg/day. A treatment-related increase in benign pheochromocytomas was observed in the adrenal glands of males that received 15 mcg/kg/day. No other statistically significant differences in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control. The relevance of these findings to patients is unknown.</p><p>When betamethasone dipropionate was applied topically to CD-1 mice for up to 24 months at dosages approximating 1.3, 4.2, and 8.5 mcg/kg/day in females, and 1.3, 4.2, and 12.9 mcg/kg/day in males (up to 26 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day and 39 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, in females and males, respectively), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control.</p><p>When betamethasone dipropionate was administered via oral gavage to male and female Sprague Dawley rats for up to 24 months at dosages of 20, 60, and 200 mcg/kg/day (120, 360, and 1200 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively), no significant changes in tumor incidence were observed when compared to control.</p><p>Calcipotriene did not elicit any genotoxic effects in the Ames mutagenicity assay, the mouse lymphoma TK locus assay, the human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse micronucleus test. Betamethasone dipropionate did not elicit any genotoxic effects in the Ames mutagenicity assay, the mouse lymphoma TK locus assay, or in the rat micronucleus test.</p><p>Studies in rats with oral doses of up to 54 mcg/kg/day (324 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day) of calcipotriene indicated no impairment of fertility or general reproductive performance. Studies in male rats at oral doses of up to 200 mcg/kg/day (1200 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day), and in female rats at oral doses of up to 1000 mcg/kg/day (6000 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day), of betamethasone dipropionate indicated no impairment of fertility.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Trials Conducted in Subjects 18 Years and Older with Psoriasis of the Scalp</span></p><p>Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind trials were conducted in adult subjects with moderate to very severe psoriasis of the scalp.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>In Trial One, 1,407 subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups: Taclonex<span class="Sup">®</span> Topical Suspension, betamethasone dipropionate in the same vehicle, calcipotriene in the same vehicle, or the vehicle alone.</li>
<li>In Trial Two, 1,280 subjects were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: Taclonex Topical Suspension, betamethasone dipropionate in the same vehicle, or calcipotriene in the same vehicle.</li>
</ul><p>Both trials enrolled subjects with moderate to very severe psoriasis of the scalp. The majority of subjects had disease of moderate severity at baseline. Subjects were treated once daily for 8 weeks. Efficacy was assessed as the proportion of subjects at Week 8 with absent or very mild disease according to the Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Severity. "Clear" was defined as no evidence of redness, thickness or scaling. "Almost clear" was defined as an overall clinical picture of lesions with the presence of minimal erythema.

In this trial, 1152 subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups: Taclonex Topical Suspension, betamethasone dipropionate in the same vehicle, calcipotriene in the same vehicle, or the vehicle alone. Seventy eight percent (78%) of subjects had disease of moderate severity at baseline. Subjects were treated once daily for 8 weeks. Efficacy was assessed at Week 4 and Week 8 as the proportion of subjects who were "Clear" or "Almost clear" according to the Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Severity. Subjects with mild disease at baseline were required to be "Clear" to be considered a success.
