These conditions can cause high blood levels of LDL cholesterol, and can also cause plaque to build up inside your arteries.</p><p>Evolocumab is also used to help lower the risk of stroke, heart attack, or other heart complications in people with heart or blood vessel problems caused by plaque build-up or hardening in the arteries (also called atherosclerosis, or arteriosclerosis).</p><p>Evolocumab may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package.
