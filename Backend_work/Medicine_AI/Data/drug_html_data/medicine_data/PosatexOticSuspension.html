Keep out of reach of children.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Animal Warnings</span>: Do not administer orally. Immediately discontinue use of POSATEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Otic Suspension if hearing loss is observed during treatment (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>: The use of POSATEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Otic Suspension in dogs with perforated tympanic membranes has not been evaluated. The integrity of the tympanic membranes should be confirmed before administering this product.</p><p>Avoid prolonged or repeated use of POSATEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Otic Suspension. Long-term use of topical otic corticosteroids has been associated with adrenocortical suppression and iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism in dogs (see <span class="Bold">ANIMAL SAFETY</span>).</p><p>The safe use of POSATEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Otic Suspension in dogs used for breeding purposes, during pregnancy or in lactating bitches, has not been evaluated. The systemic administration of quinolones has been shown to produce cartilage erosions of weight bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>: In the field study, 143 dogs were treated with POSATEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Otic Suspension. Of those, 1 dog with bilateral otitis externa developed hearing loss. POSATEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Otic Suspension treatment was discontinued and the condition resolved after one week.</p><p>To report suspected adverse reactions, call 1-800-224-5318.</p><p>For a copy of the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) call 1-800-770-8878.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Orbifloxacin</span>: Orbifloxacin is a synthetic fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent. The bactericidal action of fluoroquinolones is concentration-dependent and results from interference with bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Since these enzymes are needed for bacterial DNA synthesis and transcription, fluoroquinolones disrupt bacterial replication and lead to bacterial cell death.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mometasone</span>: Mometasone furoate monohydrate is a topical corticosteroid characterized by a (2') furoate 17-ester having chlorine at the 9 and 21 positions.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Posaconazole</span>: Posaconazole is a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal agent. The mechanism by which triazoles exert fungicidal action involves the selective inhibition of the enzyme lanosterol a C14 demethylase (a microsomal cytochrome P-450- dependent enzyme) involved in ergosterol biosynthesis in yeasts and filamentous fungi.</p><p>Systemic absorption of the active ingredients was determined in single-dose radiolabelled studies with <span class="Sup">14</span>C-orbifloxacin, <span class="Sup">3</span>H-mometasone furoate, and <span class="Sup">14</span>C-posaconazole contained within the POSATEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Otic Suspension formulation and placed into the ear canals of normal beagle dogs. Most of the absorption occurred in the first few days after administration. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical medications is influenced by many factors including the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Inflammation can increase the percutaneous absorption of drugs.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">EFFECTIVENESS</span>: The effectiveness of POSATEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Otic Suspension was evaluated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-site field study. One hundred and ninety one dogs with naturally occurring clinical otitis externa associated with both yeast and bacteria were randomly allocated to either POSATEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Otic Suspension or placebo ointment. Of the 160 dogs evaluated for effectiveness, 122 were treated with POSATEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Otic Suspension and 38 were treated with placebo ointment. Treatments were administered once daily for 7 consecutive days. Assessment of effectiveness was based on improvement in clinical signs at re-evaluation 2-7 days following administration of the last dose.</p><p>Compared to the placebo, a significant percent of dogs treated with POSATEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Otic Suspension showed improvement in clinical signs (discomfort, erythema, and swelling) caused by otitis externa associated with one or more of the following organisms: <span class="Italics">Malassezia pachydermatis</span>, coagulase positive staphylococci, <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, and <span class="Italics">Enterococcus faecalis</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ANIMAL SAFETY</span>: POSATEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Otic Suspension was administered at 1,3, and 5 times the recommended dosage for 21 consecutive days. The control group received the vehicle in both ears at the clinical dose given five times per day. There was a slight decrease in serum cortisol concentration after ACTH stimulation on Day 21 in the 5× group. Erythema was noted in all groups. Aural pain, swelling, or heat were each noted in 3 separate dogs in the 5× group.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">STORAGE INFORMATION</span>: Store at temperatures between 2°-30°C (35.6°-86°F).</p><p><span class="Bold">Shake well before use.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HOW SUPPLIED</span>: POSATEX<span class="Sup">®</span> Otic Suspension is available in 7.5 g, 15 g, and 30 g plastic bottles.</p><p class="First">NADA# 141-266, Approved by FDA.</p><p>All rights reserved.</p><p>Made in Germany</p><p>Rev. 06/2018</p><p>187045 R2</p><h2>PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL - 30 g Bottle Label</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NDC</span> 0061-0089-03<br/>
