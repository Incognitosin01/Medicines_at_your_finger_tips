It is also used to help diagnose or find problems in the liver or urinary tract.</p><p>Sulfur hexafluoride lipid type A microspheres is an ultrasound contrast agent. Ultrasound contrast agents are used to help provide a clear picture during ultrasound. Ultrasound is a special kind of diagnostic procedure. It uses high-frequency sound waves to create images or “pictures” of certain areas inside the body. The sound waves produced by the ultrasound equipment can be reflected (bounced off) by different parts of the body, such as the heart or liver. As the sound waves return they are electronically converted into images on a television screen. Unlike x-rays, ultrasound does not involve ionizing radiation. The lipid microspheres sonicated preparation contains very small gas-filled lipid microspheres that reflect the sound waves and help create a better picture.</p><p>Sulfur hexafluoride lipid type a microspheres is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor with specialized training in ultrasound procedures.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using sulfur hexafluoride lipid type a microspheres</h2><p>In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of sulfur hexafluoride lipid type A microsphere injection for echocardiogram, liver and urinary tract ultrasound in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of sulfur hexafluoride lipid type A microsphere injection in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this diagnostic test.
