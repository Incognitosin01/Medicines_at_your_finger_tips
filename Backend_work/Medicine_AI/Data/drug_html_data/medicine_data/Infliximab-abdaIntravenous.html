<html><head></head><body><h1>Infliximab-abda (Intravenous)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> infliximab (in-FLIX-i-mab - abda)</p><p>Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including TB, bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis) and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. Discontinue infliximab-abda if a patient develops a serious infection. Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting infliximab-abda. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, including infliximab. Postmarketing cases of fatal hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including infliximab products. Almost all had received azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF-blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of reported cases have occurred in patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, most of whom were adolescent or young adult males .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

It is used in children to treat Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Infliximab-abda injection is a monoclonal antibody that works to enhance and improve the immune system.</p><p>Infliximab-abda is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using infliximab-abda</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For infliximab-abda, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to infliximab-abda or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of infliximab-abda injection for the <i>treatment of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis in children 6 years of age and older</i>. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 6 years of age.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of infliximab-abda injection in <i>children with plaque psoriasis</i>. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have demonstrated that infliximab-abda injection is <i>not helpful in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</i>. Efficacy has not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of infliximab-abda injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have infections, which may require caution in patients receiving infliximab-abda injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving infliximab-abda, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using infliximab-abda with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of infliximab-abda</h2><p>A doctor or other trained health professional will give you infliximab-abda in a medical facility. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. The medicine must be given slowly, so the needle will have to remain in place for at least 2 hours.</p><p>Infliximab-abda should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have questions.</p><p>You may also receive other medicines (eg, allergy medicine, fever medicine, steroids) to help prevent possible unwanted effects from the injection.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using infliximab-abda</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that infliximab-abda is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Infliximab-abda may cause an infusion reaction while you are receiving it or right after the infusion ends. Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you have chest pain, a fever, chills, itching, hives, a rash, dizziness, fainting, lightheadedness, a headache, joint pain, difficulty with swallowing, trouble breathing, or swelling of the face, tongue, and throat.</p><p>Infliximab-abda may increase your risk for stroke, heart attack, low or high blood pressure, or heart rhythm problems during and within 24 hours of infusion. It may also cause temporary vision loss during or within 2 hours of infusion. Check with your doctor right away if you have confusion, difficulty in speaking, slow speech, inability to speak, inability to move your arms, legs, or facial muscles, double vision headache, blurred vision, dizziness, pounding in the ears, fainting, or a fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat during or after receiving the medicine.</p><p>Your body's ability to fight an infection may be reduced while you are receiving infliximab-abda. It is very important that you call your doctor at the first sign of any infection. Check with your doctor right away if you have a fever, chills, cough, flu-like symptoms, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Serious skin reactions can occur while you are receiving infliximab-abda. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, chills, cough, diarrhea, fever, itching, joint or muscle pain, red skin lesions, sore throat, sores, ulcers, or white spots in your mouth, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Infliximab-abda may increase your chance of having a lupus-like syndrome or a liver disease called autoimmune hepatitis. Check with your doctor right away if you have dark brown-colored urine, fever or chills, a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or weakness, joint pain, light-colored stools, nausea and vomiting, a rash on the cheeks or arms that is worse in the sun, severe tiredness, upper right-sided stomach pain, or yellow eyes and skin.</p><p>A small number of people (including children and teenagers) who have used infliximab-abda have developed certain types of cancer. This is more common in patients who have lung diseases (eg, emphysema, COPD) or are heavy smokers, and in psoriasis patients who have had phototherapy treatment for a long time. Phototherapy treatment is ultraviolet light or sunlight combined with oral medicine to make your skin sensitive to light. Some teenagers and young adults with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis also developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Talk with your doctor if you have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, unexplained weight loss, or red, scaly patches, or raised bumps with pus on the skin.</p><p>Receiving infliximab-abda may increase your risk of getting skin cancer (eg, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma) or cervical cancer. If you have any changes or growths on your skin or if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding, pain in your pelvis, or frequent or painful urination, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>While you are being treated with infliximab-abda, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. <i>Live virus vaccines should not be given with infliximab-abda</i>. Your child's vaccinations must be current before receiving infliximab-abda. Talk to your child's doctor if you have any questions about this.</p><p>If you have a baby while receiving infliximab-abda, make sure the baby's doctor knows that you were receiving infliximab-abda. You will need to wait a few months before giving certain vaccines to your baby. Talk to the baby's doctor if you have questions.</p><p>You will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start receiving infliximab-abda. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.</p><p>It is important to have your heart checked closely while you are receiving infliximab-abda, because infliximab-abda may cause new or worsening heart failure. Call your doctor right away if you have trouble with breathing, swelling in the ankles and feet, or a sudden weight gain.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes abatacept (Orencia®), anakinra (Kineret®), tocilizumab (Actemra®), or other medicines called biologics that are used to treat the same conditions as infliximab-abda. <i>Using these medicines together with infliximab-abda may increase your chance of having serious unwanted effects</i>.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Infliximab-abda side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
