They are needed in small amounts only and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Pyridoxine (vitamin B 6) is necessary for normal breakdown of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.</p><p>Some conditions may increase your need for pyridoxine. These include:</p><ul>
<li>Alcoholism</li>
<li>Burns</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Dialysis</li>
<li>Heart disease</li>
<li>Intestinal problems</li>
<li>Liver disease</li>
<li>Overactive thyroid</li>
<li>Stress, long-term illness, or serious injury</li>
<li>Surgical removal of stomach</li>
</ul><p>In addition, infants receiving unfortified formulas such as evaporated milk may need additional pyridoxine.</p><p>Increased need for pyridoxine should be determined by your health care professional.</p><p>Lack of pyridoxine may lead to anemia (weak blood), nerve damage, seizures, skin problems, and sores in the mouth. Your doctor may treat these problems by prescribing pyridoxine for you.</p><p>Claims that pyridoxine is effective for treatment of acne and other skin problems, alcohol intoxication, asthma, hemorrhoids, kidney stones, mental problems, migraine headaches, morning sickness, and menstrual problems, or to stimulate appetite or milk production have not been proven.</p><p>Injectable pyridoxine is given by or under the supervision of a health care professional. Other forms of pyridoxine are available without a prescription.</p><h2>Importance of Diet</h2><p>For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.</p><p>Pyridoxine is found in various foods, including meats, bananas, lima beans, egg yolks, peanuts, and whole-grain cereals. Pyridoxine is not lost from food during ordinary cooking, although some other forms of vitamin B 6 are.</p><p>Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves often cannot work without the presence of other foods.</p><p>The daily amount of pyridoxine needed is defined in several different ways.</p><ul>For U.S.—
<li>Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).</li>
<li>Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).</li>
</ul><ul>For Canada—
<li>Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.</li>
</ul><p>Normal daily recommended intakes for pyridoxine are generally defined as follows:</p><ul>
<li>Infants and children—
<ul>
<li>Birth to 3 years of age: 0.3 to 1 milligram (mg).</li>
<li>4 to 6 years of age: 1.1 mg.</li>
<li>7 to 10 years of age: 1.4 mg.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adolescent and adult males—1.7 to 2 mg.</li>
<li>Adolescent and adult females—1.4 to 1.6 mg.</li>
<li>Pregnant females—2.2 mg.</li>
