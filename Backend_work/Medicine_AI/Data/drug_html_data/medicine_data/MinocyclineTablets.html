</ul><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride tablets and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.</p><h2>Minocycline Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Minocycline hydrochloride, is a semisynthetic derivative of tetracycline, 4,7-Bis(dimethylamino)-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12a-octahydro-3,10,12,12a-tetrahydroxy-1,11-dioxo-2-naphthacenecarboxamide monohydrochloride. Its structural formula is:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Minocycline hydrochloride tablets, USP for oral administration contain minocycline hydrochloride USP equivalent to 50 mg, 75 mg or 100 mg of minocycline. In addition, 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg tablets contain the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, povidone, sodium starch glycolate and titanium dioxide.</p><h2>Minocycline Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Following a single dose of one 100 mg tablet of minocycline hydrochloride administered to 28 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 3 hours (average 1.71 hours) and ranged from 491.71 to 1292.70 ng/mL (average 758.29 ng/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.38 to 24.31 hours (average 17.03 hours).</p><p>When minocycline hydrochloride tablets were given concomitantly with a meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride tablets was slightly decreased (6%). The peak plasma concentrations were slightly decreased (12%) and delayed by 1.09 hours when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride may be administered with or without food.</p><p>In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines.</p><p><span class="Bold">Microbiology</span></p><p>The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have similar antimicrobial spectra of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common.</p><p>Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections as described in the <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span> section:</p><p>AEROBIC GRAM-POSITIVE MICROORGANISMS</p><p>Because many strains of the following gram-positive microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility testing are especially recommended. Tetracycline antibiotics should not be used for streptococcal diseases unless the organism has been demonstrated to be susceptible. Tetracyclines are not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.</p><p><span class="Italics">Bacillus</span> <span class="Italics">anthracis</span> <span class="Sup">a</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Listeria</span> <span class="Italics">monocytogenes</span><span class="Sup">a</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureu</span><span class="Italics">s</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span></p><p>AEROBIC GRAM-NEGATIVE MICROORGANISMS</p><p><span class="Italics">Bartonella bacilliformi</span><span class="Italics">s</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Brucella</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Calymmatobacterium granulomati</span><span class="Italics">s</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Campylobacter fetus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Francisella tularensi</span><span class="Italics">s</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus ducrey</span><span class="Italics">i</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Vibrio cholerae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Yersinia pesti</span><span class="Italics">s</span></p><p>Because many strains of the following groups of gram-negative microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility tests are especially recommended.</p><p><span class="Italics">Acinetobacter</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Enterobacter aerogene</span><span class="Italics">s</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Escherichia col</span><span class="Italics">i</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenza</span><span class="Italics">e</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Klebsiella</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Neisseria</span> <span class="Italics">gonorrhoeae</span><span class="Sup">a</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Neisseria</span> <span class="Italics">meningitidis</span><span class="Sup">a</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Shigella</span> species</p><p>“OTHER” MICROORGANISMS</p><p><span class="Italics">Actinomyces</span> species <span class="Sup">a</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Borrelia recurrentis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Chlamydia psittaci</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Chlamydia trachomatis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Clostridium</span> species<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Entamoeba</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Fusobacterium nucleatum</span> subspecies <span class="Italics">fusiforme</span> <span class="Sup">a</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Mycobacterium marinum</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Mycoplasma pneumonia</span><span class="Italics">e</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acne</span><span class="Italics">s</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Rickettsia</span><span class="Italics">e</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Treponema pallidum</span> subspecies <span class="Italics">pallidum</span><span class="Sup">a</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Treponema pallidum</span> subspecies <span class="Italics">pertenue</span><span class="Sup">a</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Ureaplasma urealyticum</span></p><p>a.

</ul><p>In acute <span class="Italics">intestinal amebiasis</span>, minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides.</p><p>In severe <span class="Italics">acne</span>, minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy.</p><p>Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of <span class="Italics">Neisseria meningitidis</span> to eliminate the meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high.</p><p><span class="Italics">Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection</span>.</p><p>Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium marinum</span>.</p><p>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride tablets and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines or to any of the components of the product formulation.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">MINOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE TABLETS, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE- CLASS ANTIBIOTICS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN).</span></p><p>This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. <span class="Bold">TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED.</span></p><p>All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued.</p><p>Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy.</p><p>Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity.</p><p>Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline.</p><p>Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued.</p><p><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><p>Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. The usual clinical manifestations are headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. While both of these conditions and related symptoms usually resolve after discontinuation of the tetracycline, the possibility for permanent sequelae exists.</p><p>Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs.</p><p>Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated.</p><p>Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria.</p><h3>Information For Patients</h3><p class="First">Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><p>Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline.</p><p>Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span>).</p><p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months.</p><p>Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.</p><p>Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin.</p><p>Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.</p><p>The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.</p><p>Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective.</p><p>Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><p>Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines.</p><h3>Drug/ Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Dietary administration of minocycline in long term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D</span> (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p><p><span class="Italics">Nonteratogenic Effects:</span> (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Minocycline is not recommended for use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span><span class="Bold">,</span> <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Due to oral minocycline’s virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines.</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a whole:</span> Fever, and discoloration of secretions.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomatitis, glossitis, dysphagia, enamel hypoplasia, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis, inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the oral and anogenital regions. Instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients taking the tetracycline-class antibiotics in capsule and tablet form. Most of these patients took the medication immediately before going to bed (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p><span class="Italics">Genitourinary:</span> Vulvovaginitis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic toxicity:</span> Hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic cholestasis, increases in liver enzymes, fatal hepatic failure, and jaundice. Hepatitis, including autoimmune hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin:</span> Alopecia, erythema nodosum, hyperpigmentation of nails, pruritus, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and vasculitis. Maculopapular and erythematous rashes. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported. Fixed drug eruptions have been reported. Lesions occurring on the glans penis have caused balanitis. Erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. Photosensitivity is discussed above (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). Pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes has been reported.</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory:</span> Cough, dyspnea, bronchospasm, exacerbation of asthma, and pneumonitis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal toxicity:</span> Interstitial nephritis. Elevations in BUN have been reported and are apparently dose related (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). Reversible acute renal failure has been reported.</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> Arthralgia, arthritis, bone discoloration, myalgia, joint stiffness, and joint swelling.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity reactions:</span> Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, polyarthralgia, anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction (including shock and fatalities), anaphylactoid purpura, myocarditis, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus and pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia have been reported. A transient lupus-like syndrome and serum sickness-like reactions have also been reported.</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood:</span> Agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and eosinophilia have been reported.</p><p><span class="Italics">Central Nervous System:</span> Convulsions, dizziness, hypesthesia, paresthesia, sedation, and vertigo. Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) in adults have been reported (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS-General</span>). Headache has also been reported.</p><p><span class="Italics">Other:</span> Thyroid cancer has been reported in the post-marketing setting in association with minocycline products. When minocycline therapy is given over prolonged periods, monitoring for signs of thyroid cancer should be considered. When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. Cases of abnormal thyroid function have been reported.</p><p>Tooth discoloration in children less than 8 years of age, and also in adults, has been reported (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>Oral cavity discoloration (including tongue, lip, and gum) have been reported.</p><p>Tinnitus and decreased hearing have been reported in patients on minocycline hydrochloride.</p><p>The following syndromes have been reported. In some cases involving these syndromes, death has been reported. As with other serious adverse reactions, if any of these syndromes are recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately:</p><p>Hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present.</p><p>Lupus-like syndrome consisting of positive antinuclear antibody; arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling; and one or more of the following: fever, myalgia, hepatitis, rash, and vasculitis.</p><p>Serum sickness-like syndrome consisting of fever; urticaria or rash; and arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling. Eosinophilia may be present.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The adverse events more commonly seen in overdose are dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.</p><p>No specific antidote for minocycline is known.</p><p>In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures. Minocycline is not removed in significant quantities by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.</p><h2>Minocycline Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES.
