</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Moxifloxacin Injection</h2><h3>Community Acquired Pneumonia</h3><p class="First">Moxifloxacin is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of Community Acquired Pneumonia caused by susceptible isolates of <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> (including multi-drug resistant <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> [MDRSP])<span class="Italics">, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis,</span> methicillin-susceptible <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae,</span> or <span class="Italics">Chlamydophila pneumoniae [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>.</p><p>MDRSP isolates are isolates resistant to two or more of the following antibacterial drugs: penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MIC] ≥ 2 mcg/mL), 2<span class="Sup">nd</span> generation cephalosporins (for example, cefuroxime), macrolides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.</p><h3>Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections</h3><p class="First">Moxifloxacin is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by susceptible isolates of methicillin-susceptible <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> or <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].</span></p><h3>Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections</h3><p class="First">Moxifloxacin is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by susceptible isolates of methicillin-susceptible <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,</span> or <span class="Italics">Enterobacter cloacae [see Clinical Studies (14.5)].</span></p><h3>Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections</h3><p class="First">Moxifloxacin is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections (cIAI) including polymicrobial infections such as abscess caused by susceptible isolates of <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron,</span> or <span class="Italics">Peptostreptococcus</span> species <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Plague</h3><p class="First">Moxifloxacin is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of plague, including pneumonic and septicemic plague, due to susceptible isolates of <span class="Italics">Yersinia pestis</span> and prophylaxis of plague in adult patients. Efficacy studies of moxifloxacin could not be conducted in humans with plague for feasibility reasons. Therefore this indication is based on an efficacy study conducted in animals only <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.7)]</span>.</p><h3>Acute Bacterial Sinusitis</h3><p class="First">Moxifloxacin is indicated in adult patients (18 years of age and older) for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) caused by susceptible isolates of <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae</span>, or <span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>.</p><p>Because fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with serious adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.14)]</span> and for some patients ABS is self-limiting, reserve moxifloxacin for treatment of ABS in patients who have no alternative treatment options.</p><h3>Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis</h3><p class="First">Moxifloxacin is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis (ABECB) caused by susceptible isolates of <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae,</span> methicillin-susceptible <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus,</span> or <span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span></p><p>Because fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with serious adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.14)]</span> and for some patients ABECB is self-limiting, reserve moxifloxacin for treatment of ABECB in patients who have no alternative treatment options.</p><h3>Usage</h3><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of moxifloxacin and other antibacterial drugs, moxifloxacin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Moxifloxacin Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage in Adult Patients</h3><p class="First">The dose of moxifloxacin is 400 mg (orally or as an intravenous infusion) once every 24 hours. The duration of therapy depends on the type of infection as described in Table 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Dosage and Duration of Therapy in Adult Patients</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Type of Infection<span class="Sup">a</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose Every</span></p><p><span class="Bold">24 Hours</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Duration<span class="Sup">b</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">(days)</span></p><p class="First">Community Acquired Pneumonia (1.1)</p><p class="First">400 mg</p><p class="First">7 to 14</p><p class="First">Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (SSSI) (1.2)</p><p class="First">400 mg</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">Complicated SSSI (1.3)</p><p class="First">400 mg</p><p class="First">7 to 21</p><p class="First">Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections (1.4)</p><p class="First">400 mg</p><p class="First">5 to 14</p><p class="First">Plague (1.5)<span class="Sup">c</span></p><p class="First">400 mg</p><p class="First">10 to 14</p><p class="First">Acute Bacterial Sinusitis (ABS) (1.6)</p><p class="First">400 mg</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis (ABECB) (1.7)</p><p class="First">400 mg</p><p class="First">5</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Conversion of Intravenous to Oral Dosing in Adults</span></span></p><p>Intravenous formulation is indicated when it offers a route of administration advantageous to the patient (for example, patient cannot tolerate an oral dosage form). When switching from intravenous to oral formulation, no dosage adjustment is necessary. Patients whose therapy is started with moxifloxacin hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection may be switched to moxifloxacin tablets when clinically indicated at the discretion of the physician.</p><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection</span></span></p><p>Administer by intravenous infusion only. It is not intended for intra-arterial, intramuscular, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration.</p><p>Administer by intravenous infusion over a period of 60 minutes by direct infusion or through a Y-type intravenous infusion set which may already be in place. Avoid rapid or bolus intravenous infusion.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p><p>Do not administer moxifloxacin hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection if particulate matter and/or discoloration is observed.</p><p>Discard any unused portion because the premix flexible containers are for single-dose only.</p><h3>Drug and Diluent Compatibilities</h3><p class="First">Because only limited data are available on the compatibility of moxifloxacin intravenous injection with other intravenous substances, additives or other medications should not be added to moxifloxacin hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection or infused simultaneously through the same intravenous line. If the same intravenous line or a Y-type line is used for sequential infusion of other drugs, or if the “piggyback” method of administration is used, the line should be flushed before and after infusion of moxifloxacin hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection with an infusion solution compatible with moxifloxacin hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection as well as with other drug(s) administered via this common line.</p><p><span class="Bold">Compatible Intravenous Solutions</span>: Moxifloxacin hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is compatible with the following intravenous solutions at ratios from 1:10 to 10:1:</p><p>0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP</p><p>1 Molar Sodium Chloride Injection</p><p>5% Dextrose Injection, USP</p><p>Sterile Water for Injection, USP</p><p>10% Dextrose for Injection, USP</p><p>Lactated Ringer’s for Injection</p><h3>Preparation for Administration of Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection</h3><p class="First">Refer to complete directions that have been provided with the administration set.</p><p>To prepare moxifloxacin hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection premix in flexible containers:</p><p>Close flow control clamp of administration set.</p><p>Remove cover from port at bottom of container.</p><p>Insert piercing pin from an appropriate transfer set (for example, one that does not require excessive force, such as ISO compatible administration set) into port with a gentle twisting motion until pin is firmly seated.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><h3>Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection</h3><p class="First">Ready-to-use single-dose 250 mL flexibags containing moxifloxacin hydrochloride (equivalent to 400 mg moxifloxacin) in 0.8% sodium chloride aqueous solution. The appearance of the intravenous solution is clear yellow. Discard the unused portion of the drug.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Moxifloxacin is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin or any member of the quinolone class of antibacterials <span class="Italics">[</span><span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy, and Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects (hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion). These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after starting moxifloxacin. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4)].</span></p><p>Discontinue moxifloxacin immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones.</p><h3>Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>and <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur within hours or days of starting moxifloxacin or as long as several months after completion of therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.</p><p>The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue moxifloxacin immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or who have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Peripheral Neuropathy</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones including moxifloxacin. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of moxifloxacin and may be irreversible in some patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span> and <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].</span></p><p>Discontinue moxifloxacin immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy.</p><h3>Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Psychiatric Adverse Reactions</span></span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of psychiatric adverse reactions, including: toxic psychosis, hallucinations, or paranoia; depression or suicidal thoughts or acts; anxiety, agitation, or nervousness; confusion, delirium, disorientation, or disturbances in attention; insomnia or nightmares; memory impairment. These adverse reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving moxifloxacin, discontinue moxifloxacin immediately and institute appropriate measures <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions</span></span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of seizures (convulsions), increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri), dizziness, and tremors. As with all fluoroquinolones, use moxifloxacin with caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizuresre or lower the seizure threshold. These adverse reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving moxifloxacin, discontinue moxifloxacin immediately and institute appropriate measures <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.4),Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)</span>and<span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></span></p><h3>Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse reactions, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in patients with myasthenia gravis. Avoid moxifloxacin in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Moxifloxacin has been shown to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients. Following oral dosing with 400 mg of moxifloxacin the mean (± SD) change in QTc from the pre-dose value at the time of maximum drug concentration was 6 msec (± 26) (n = 787). Following a course of daily intravenous dosing (400 mg; 1 hour infusion each day) the mean change in QTc from the Day 1 pre-dose value was 10 msec (±22) on Day 1 (n=667) and 7 msec (± 24) on Day 3 (n = 667).</p><p>Avoid moxifloxacin in patients with the following risk factors due to the lack of clinical experience with the drug in these patient populations:</p><p>In patients with mild, moderate, or severe liver cirrhosis, metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency may lead to QT prolongation. Monitor ECG in patients with liver cirrhosis treated with moxifloxacin <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug or increasing rates of infusion of the intravenous formulation. Therefore the recommended dose or infusion rate should not be exceeded.</p><p>In premarketing clinical trials, the rate of cardiovascular adverse reactions was similar in 798 moxifloxacin and 702 comparator treated patients who received concomitant therapy with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval. No excess in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality attributable to QTc prolongation occurred with moxifloxacin treatment in over 15,500 patients in controlled clinical studies, including 759 patients who were hypokalemic at the start of treatment, and there was no increase in mortality in over 18,000 moxifloxacin tablet treated patients in a postmarketing observational study in which ECGs were not performed.</p><h3>Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Other serious and sometimes fatal adverse reactions, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported in patients receiving therapy with fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin. These reactions may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following:</p><p>Discontinue moxifloxacin immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and institute supportive measures<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious anaphylactic reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolone therapy, including moxifloxacin. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Discontinue moxifloxacin at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].</span></p><h3>Risk of Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection</h3><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including moxifloxacin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Arthropathic Effects in Animals</h3><p class="First">In immature dogs, oral administration of moxifloxacin caused lameness. Histopathological examination of the weight-bearing joints of these dogs revealed permanent lesions of the cartilage. Related quinolone-class drugs also produce erosions of cartilage of weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Blood Glucose Disturbances</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">As with all fluoroquinolones, disturbances in blood glucose, including both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia have been reported with moxifloxacin. In moxifloxacin-treated patients, dysglycemia occurred predominantly in elderly diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (for example, sulfonylurea) or with insulin. Severe cases of hypoglycemia resulting in coma or death have been reported. In diabetic patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs, discontinue moxifloxacin and initiate appropriate therapy immediately <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7.3)</span>and<span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></span></p><h3>Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity</h3><p class="First">Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (for example, burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, “V” area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided. Moxifloxacin should be discontinued if phototoxicity occurs <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing moxifloxacin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious and otherwise important adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in the warnings and precautions section of the label:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to moxifloxacin in 14981 patients in 71 active controlled Phase II to IV clinical trials in different indications <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1)]</span>. The population studied had a mean age of 50 years (approximately 73% of the population was less than 65 years of age), 50% were male, 63% were Caucasian, 12% were Asian and 9% were Black. Patients received moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily oral, intravenous, or sequentially (intravenous followed by oral). Treatment duration was usually 6 to 10 days, and the mean number of days on therapy was 9 days.</p><p>Discontinuation of moxifloxacin due to adverse reactions occurred in 5% of patients overall, 4% of patients treated with 400 mg PO, 4% with 400 mg intravenous and 8% with sequential therapy 400 mg oral/intravenous. The most common adverse reactions (&gt;0.3%) leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg oral doses were nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and vomiting. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg intravenous dose was rash. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg intravenous/oral sequential dose were diarrhea, pyrexia.</p><p>Adverse reactions occurring in 1% of moxifloxacin-treated patients and less common adverse reactions, occurring in 0.1 to 1% of moxifloxacin-treated patients, are shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. The most common adverse drug reactions (3%) are nausea, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Common (1% or more) Adverse Reactions Reported in Active-Controlled Clinical Trials with Moxifloxacin</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">System Organ Class</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">%</span><br/>

Oral administration of moxifloxacin with antacids containing aluminum or magnesium, with sucralfate, with metal cations such as iron, or with multivitamins containing iron or zinc, or with formulations containing divalent and trivalent cations such as didanosine buffered tablets for oral suspension or the pediatric powder for oral solution, may substantially interfere with the absorption of moxifloxacin, resulting in systemic concentrations considerably lower than desired. Therefore, moxifloxacin should be taken at least 4 hours before or 8 hours after these agents <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Warfarin</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of warfarin or its derivatives in the patient population. In addition, infectious disease and its accompanying inflammatory process, age, and general status of the patient are risk factors for increased anticoagulant activity. Therefore the prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if moxifloxacin is administered concomitantly with warfarin or its derivatives <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Antidiabetic Agents</h3><p class="First">Disturbances of blood glucose, including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, and an antidiabetic agent. Therefore, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs, moxifloxacin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be initiated immediately <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)</span> and <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs</h3><p class="First">The concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a fluoroquinolone, including moxifloxacin, may increase the risks of CNS stimulation and convulsions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span></p><h3>Drugs that Prolong QT</h3><p class="First">There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction in humans between moxifloxacin and other drugs that prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram.

Moxifloxacin was not teratogenic when administered to pregnant rats (IV and oral), rabbits (IV), and monkeys (oral) at exposures that were 0.25 to 2.5 times of those at the human clinical dose (400 mg/day moxifloxacin). However, when moxifloxacin was administered to rats and rabbits during pregnancy and throughout lactation (rats only) at doses associated with maternal toxicity, decreased neonatal body weights, increased incidence of skeletal variations (rib and vertebra combined), and increased fetal loss were observed <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span> Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4% and of miscarriage is 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Animal reproductive and development studies were done in rats, rabbits and cynomolgus macaques. Moxifloxacin was not teratogenic when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 17) at oral doses as high as 500 mg/kg/day or 0.24 times the maximum recommended human dose based on systemic exposure (AUC), but decreased fetal body weights and slightly delayed fetal skeletal development were observed. Intravenous administration of 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area) to pregnant rats resulted in maternal toxicity and a marginal effect on fetal and placental weights and the appearance of the placenta (Gestation days 6 to 17). There was no evidence of teratogenicity at intravenous doses as high as 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area) in pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation days 6 to 17). Intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately equal to the maximum recommended human oral dose based upon systemic exposure) to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 20) resulted in decreased fetal body weights and delayed fetal skeletal ossification. When rib and vertebral malformations were combined, there was an increased fetal and litter incidence of these effects in rabbits. Signs of maternal toxicity in rabbits at this dose included mortality, abortions, marked reduction of food consumption, decreased water intake, body weight loss and hypoactivity. There was no evidence of teratogenicity when pregnant cynomolgus macaques were given oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the maximum recommended human dose based upon systemic exposure) during organogenesis (gestation days 20 to 50). An increased incidence of smaller fetuses was observed at 100 mg/kg/day in macaques. In a pre- and postnatal development study conducted in rats given oral doses from Gestation day 6, throughout gestation and rearing to Postpartum day 21, effects observed at 500 mg/kg/day (0.24 times the maximum recommended human dose based on systemic exposure (AUC)) included slight increases in duration of pregnancy and prenatal loss, reduced pup birth weight and decreased neonatal survival. Treatment-related maternal mortality occurred during gestation at 500 mg/kg/day in this study.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>It is not known if moxifloxacin is present in human milk.

This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing moxifloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential side effect and advised to discontinue moxifloxacin and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning,</span> and <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p>Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.9)</span><span class="Italics">].</span></p><p>In controlled multiple-dose clinical trials, 23% of patients receiving oral moxifloxacin were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 9% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. The clinical trial data demonstrate that there is no difference in the safety and efficacy of oral moxifloxacin in patients aged 65 or older compared to younger adults.</p><p>In trials of intravenous use, 42% of moxifloxacin patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age, and 23% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. The clinical trial data demonstrate that the safety of intravenous moxifloxacin in patients aged 65 or older was similar to that of comparator-treated patients. In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects of the QT interval. Therefore, moxifloxacin should be avoided in patients taking drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Drug Interactions (7.5),</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetic parameters of moxifloxacin are not significantly altered in mild, moderate, severe, or end-stage renal disease.

However, due to metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency, which may lead to QT prolongation, moxifloxacin should be used with caution in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology, (12.3)</span><span class="Italics">].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Single oral overdoses up to 2.8 g were not associated with any serious adverse events. In the event of acute overdose, empty the stomach and maintain adequate hydration. Monitor ECG due to the possibility of QT interval prolongation. Carefully observe the patient and give supportive treatment. The administration of activated charcoal as soon as possible after oral overdose may prevent excessive increase of systemic moxifloxacin exposure. About 3% and 9% of the dose of moxifloxacin, as well as about 2% and 4.5% of its glucuronide metabolite are removed by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, respectively.</p><h2>Moxifloxacin Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Moxifloxacin hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection is a synthetic antibacterial agent for intravenous administration.
