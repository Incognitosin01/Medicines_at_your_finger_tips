It is also used as part of a support program to help people stop smoking.</p><p>Bupropion is sold under different brand names. If you are already taking medicine for depression or to help you stop smoking, discuss this with your doctor before taking bupropion. It is very important that you receive only one prescription at a time for bupropion.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Budeprion SR</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of bupropion in the pediatric population. However, children are more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than adults when used for treating depression. Use of bupropion to treat depression in children is not recommended. Safety and efficacy of bupropion to help stop smoking have not been established in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of bupropion in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of this medicine and are more likely to have age-related kidney or liver problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving bupropion.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
