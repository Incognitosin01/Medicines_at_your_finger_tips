Hepatitis causes inflammation of the liver, vomiting, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes). Hepatitis can lead to liver cancer, cirrhosis, or death.</p><p>Hepatitis B is spread through blood or bodily fluids, sexual contact, and by sharing items such as a razor, toothbrush, or IV drug needle with an infected person. Hepatitis B can also be passed to a baby during childbirth when the mother is infected.</p><p>Engerix-B helps your body develop immunity to hepatitis B, but it will not treat an active infection you already have.</p><p>Vaccination with Engerix-B is recommended for all adults who are at risk of getting hepatitis B. Risk factors include: living with someone infected with hepatitis B virus; having more than one sex partner; men who have sex with men; having sexual contact with infected people; having hepatitis C, chronic liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, HIV or AIDS; being on dialysis; using intravenous (IV) drugs; living or working in a facility for developmentally disabled people; working in healthcare or public safety and being exposed to blood or body fluids; living or working in a correctional facility; being a victim of sexual abuse or assault; and traveling to areas where hepatitis B is common.</p><p>Like any vaccine, the hepatitis B vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive Engerix-B if you are allergic to yeast.</p><p>Engerix-B will not protect against hepatitis B if you are already infected with the virus, even if you do not yet show symptoms.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Engerix-B will not protect against infection with hepatitis A, C, and E, or other viruses that affect the liver. It may also not protect against hepatitis B if you are already infected with the virus, even if you do not yet show symptoms.</p><p>You should not receive Engerix-B if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any vaccine containing hepatitis B, or if you are allergic to yeast.</p><p>If you have any of these other conditions, your vaccine may need to be postponed or not given at all:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>multiple sclerosis;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kidney disease (or if you are on dialysis);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a bleeding or blood clotting disorder such as hemophilia or easy bruising;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>weak immune system (caused by disease or by using certain medicine);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an allergy to latex; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a neurologic disorder or disease affecting the brain (or if this was a reaction to a previous vaccine).</p>

If you have a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, your doctor may recommend waiting until you get better before you receive Engerix-B.</p><p>It is not known whether Engerix-B will harm an unborn baby. However, if you are at a high risk for infection with hepatitis B during pregnancy, your doctor should determine whether you need a hepatitis b vaccination.</p><p>If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry to track the effects of this vaccine on the baby.</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while receiving hepatitis b vaccine. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2>How is Engerix-B given?</h2><p>Engerix-B is given as an injection (shot) into a muscle. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>Engerix-B is given in a series of 2 to 4 shots. The booster shots are sometimes given 1 month and 6 months after the first shot. If you have a high risk of hepatitis B infection, you may be given an additional booster 1 to 2 months after the third shot.</p><p>Your individual booster schedule may be different from these guidelines. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by the health department of the state you live in.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Hepatitis B Prophylaxis:</b></p><p>Primary Vaccination:<br/>

<br/>
Start Engerix-B as soon as possible after exposure.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Contact your doctor if you will miss a booster dose or if you get behind schedule. The next dose should be given as soon as possible. There is no need to start over.</p><p>Be sure to receive all recommended doses of Engerix-B or you may not be fully protected against disease.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of Engerix-B is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid before or after receiving Engerix-B?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Engerix-B side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Engerix-B:</b> (hives, difficult breathing, swelling in your face or throat) <b>or a severe skin reaction</b> (fever, sore throat, burning eyes, skin pain, red or purple skin rash with blistering and peeling).</p><p>You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.</p><p>Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving Engerix-B. When you receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects.</p><p>Becoming infected with hepatitis B is much more dangerous to your health than receiving Engerix-B.
