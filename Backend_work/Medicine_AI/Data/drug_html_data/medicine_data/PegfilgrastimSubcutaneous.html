It is a synthetic (man-made) form of a substance that is naturally produced in your body called a colony stimulating factor. Pegfilgrastim helps the bone marrow to make new white blood cells.</p><p>When certain cancer medicines are used to fight cancer cells, they also affect the white blood cells that fight infections. Pegfilgrastim is used to reduce the risk of infection while you are being treated with cancer medicines. It is also used to improve survival in cancer patients who have been exposed to radiation.</p><p>Pegfilgrastim is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using pegfilgrastim</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For pegfilgrastim, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to pegfilgrastim or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pegfilgrastim injection in the pediatric population.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pegfilgrastim in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of pegfilgrastim. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Bone marrow cancer or other bone marrow problems or</li>
<li>Glomerulonephritis (kidney disease) or</li>
<li>Leukocytosis (high white blood cell count) or</li>
<li>Lung disease or breathing problems or</li>
<li>Sickle cell disease (red blood cell disease)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Sepsis (serious infection)—There have been reports of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients who had a serious infection and were receiving a similar medicine called filgrastim.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of pegfilgrastim</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional may give you pegfilgrastim. It is given as a shot under your skin.</p><p>You may be taught how to give pegfilgrastim at home. Make sure you understand all of the instructions before giving yourself an injection. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.</p><p>Pegfilgrastim may be given in 2 ways: a single <i>prefilled syringe for manual use</i> or for use with the <i>On-body Injector for Neulasta® use</i>.</p><p>Pegfilgrastim comes with patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about:</p><ul>
<li>How to prepare the injection.</li>
<li>The proper use of disposable syringes.</li>
<li>How to give the injection.</li>
<li>How long the injection can be stored at home.</li>
</ul><p>If you have any questions about any of these, check with your doctor.</p><p>Start using the medicine 24 hours or more after you finish your chemotherapy. However, do not use it within 24 hours before you begin another chemotherapy treatment.</p><p>Allow the medicine to warm to room temperature before you inject it. If the medicine in the prefilled syringe has changed color, looks cloudy, or if you see particles in it, do not use it. Do not shake the syringe. Use the syringe only once. Do not save leftover medicine.</p><p>The needle cover of the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause an allergic reaction in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you have a latex allergy before you start using pegfilgrastim.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of pegfilgrastim will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of pegfilgrastim. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

<li>Keep the injector dry at least 3 hours before the dose is scheduled to start. This will help you notice any leaks. Call your doctor if the bandage becomes wet or the medicine is dripping.</li>
<li>The injector is programmed to deliver your dose about 27 hours after it is placed on your skin. It will take about 45 minutes for the dose to be given.
