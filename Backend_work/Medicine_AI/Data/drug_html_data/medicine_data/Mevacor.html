This medicine may also help prevent medical problems (eg, chest pain, heart attack, stroke) caused by fat clogging the blood vessels. It may also be used to prevent certain types of heart and blood vessel problems in patients with risk factors for heart problems.</p><p>Lovastatin belongs to the group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins. It works to reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood by blocking an enzyme that is needed by the body to make cholesterol.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Mevacor</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of lovastatin <i>tablets</i> in children 10 to 17 years of age. However, safety and efficacy in children younger than 10 years of age have not been established.</p><p>Teenage girls taking lovastatin <i>tablets</i> should be counseled on appropriate birth control methods to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of lovastatin <i>extended-release tablets</i> in the pediatric population.
