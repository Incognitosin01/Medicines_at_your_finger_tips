Male pattern hair loss is a common condition in which men experience thinning of the hair on the scalp. Often, this results in a receding hairline and/or balding on the top of the head. Propecia is for use by men only and should not be used by women or children.</p><p>Propecia may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Propecia should never be taken by a woman or a child. Finasteride can be absorbed through the skin, and women or children should not be permitted to handle Propecia tablets.</p><p>Although Propecia is not for use by women, this medication can cause birth defects if a woman is exposed to it during pregnancy. Propecia tablets should not be handled by a woman who is pregnant or who may become pregnant. Propecia tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets are not broken or crushed. If a woman accidentally comes into contact with this medication from a broken or crushed tablet, wash the area with soap and water right away.</p><p>Before taking Propecia, tell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to finasteride, or to a similar medicine called dutasteride (Avodart).</p><p>Using Propecia may increase your risk of developing prostate cancer. Your doctor will perform tests to make sure you do not have other conditions that would prevent you from safely using Propecia.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you notice any breast lumps, pain, nipple discharge, or other breast changes. These may be signs of male breast cancer.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Propecia should never be taken by a woman or a child.
