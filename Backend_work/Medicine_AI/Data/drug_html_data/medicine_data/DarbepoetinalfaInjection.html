Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were at a greater risk for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target Hb levels of greater than 11 g/dL in clinical studies. No trial has identified a Hb target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. In CKD patients, use the lowest sufficient dose to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. In cancer patients with certain tumor types (ie, breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, cervical), ESAs shortened overall survival and increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in clinical studies. In cancer patients, use the lowest dose needed to avoid RBC transfusions to reduce these risks and the risk of serious cardiovascular and thromboembolic reactions. Use ESAs only for treatment of anemia due to concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and discontinue following the completion of a chemotherapy course. Patients receiving myelosuppressive therapy when the anticipated outcome is cure should not be treated with ESAs .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

If the body does not produce enough red blood cells, severe anemia can occur. This often occurs in people with chronic kidney failure whose kidneys are not working properly. Darbepoetin may be used for patients on kidney dialysis or for those not on dialysis. Anemia can also occur in people who are receiving chemotherapy to treat cancer. Darbepoetin alfa is used to treat severe anemia in these patients.</p><p>Darbepoetin alfa is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using darbepoetin alfa</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of darbepoetin alfa</h2><p>Darbepoetin alfa injection is usually given by a doctor in a hospital or clinic. However, medicines given by injection are sometimes used at home. If you will be using darbepoetin alfa at home, your doctor will teach you how the injections are to be given. Be sure you understand exactly how the medicine is to be injected.</p><p>It may be given as a shot under your skin or into a vein. If your doctor tells you to inject it in a certain way, follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Darbepoetin alfa comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Darbepoetin alfa is available in 2 forms. You may use a vial or a prefilled syringe with an UltraSafe® Needle Guard.</p><p>If you are giving darbepoetin alfa at home:</p><ul>
<li>Use a new needle and syringe each time you inject your medicine.</li>
<li>Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.</li>
<li>You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given.</li>

When darbepoetin alfa begins to work, usually in about 6 weeks, most people start to feel better. Some people are able to be more active. But darbepoetin alfa only corrects anemia. It has no effect on kidney disease, cancer, or any other medical problem that needs regular medical attention. Even if you are feeling much better, <i>it is very important that you do not miss any appointments with your doctor or any dialysis treatments</i>.</p><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your blood regularly while you are using darbepoetin alfa</i>. You may also need to monitor your blood pressure at home. If you notice any changes to your normal blood pressure, call your doctor right away.</p><p>Darbepoetin alfa may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. This can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, swelling of the face, tongue, and throat, trouble with breathing, or chest pain after you receive the medicine.</p><p>Darbepoetin alfa may increase your risk of having blood clots. This is more likely in patients who use high doses of darbepoetin alfa, or who use darbepoetin alfa before major surgery. If you have chest pain, trouble breathing, or pain, redness, or swelling in your arms or legs while using darbepoetin alfa, call your doctor right away. If you are getting kidney dialysis treatments, tell your doctor right away if you notice blood clots at your injection site. Your doctor may give you a blood thinner before surgery to help prevent blood clots.</p><p>Darbepoetin alfa may also increase your risk of having serious heart and blood vessel problems such as a heart attack, congestive heart failure, or stroke. Check with your doctor right away if you start having dizziness, fainting spells, severe tiredness, chest pain, trouble with breathing, sudden or severe headache, or problems with vision, speech, or walking.</p><p>When used in patients with certain types of cancer (eg, breast, cervix, lymphoid, lung, head, or neck cancer), darbepoetin alfa has shortened survival time and worsened the tumor or cancer in some patients. If you are concerned about this, talk with your doctor.</p><p>Darbepoetin alfa sometimes causes convulsions (seizures), especially during the first few months of treatment. During this time, it is best to <i>avoid driving, operating heavy machinery, or other activities that could cause a serious injury if a seizure occurs while you are performing them</i>.</p><p>One form of darbepoetin alfa injection has an ingredient that comes from donated human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses to people who have received them, although the risk is low. Human donors and donated blood are both tested for viruses to keep the transmission risk low. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.</p><p>Serious skin reactions can occur with darbepoetin alfa. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, red skin lesions, severe acne or a skin rash, sores or ulcers on the skin, or fever or chills with darbepoetin alfa.</p><p>The needle cover of the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you have a latex allergy before you start using darbepoetin alfa.</p><p>Many people with kidney problems need to be on a special diet. Also, people with high blood pressure (which may be caused by kidney disease or by darbepoetin alfa treatment) may need to be on a special diet or to take medicine to keep their blood pressure under control. After their anemia has been corrected, some people feel so much better that they want to eat more than before. To keep your kidney disease or your high blood pressure from getting worse, it is very important that you follow your special diet and take your medicines regularly, even if you are feeling better.</p><p>In addition to darbepoetin alfa, your body needs iron and vitamins to make red blood cells. Your doctor may direct you to take iron or vitamin supplements. Be sure to follow your doctor's orders carefully. Darbepoetin alfa will not work well if you do not have enough iron or vitamins in your body.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Darbepoetin alfa side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
