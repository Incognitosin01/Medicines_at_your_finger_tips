However care must be taken not to exceed the recommended dosage.<br/></p><h2>Traumeel - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The exact mechanism of action of Traumeel® Injection Solution is not fully understood. Various cellular and biochemical pathways appear to be modulated by the product ingredients. The mechanism or action of Traumeel® Injection Solution does not appear to be the result of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase enzyme inhibition, as is the case with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Traumeel® Injection Solution does not inhibit the arachidonic acid pathway of prostaglandin synthesis. Instead, the mechanism of action of Traumeel® Injection Solution appears to be the result of modulation of the release of oxygen radicals from activated neutrophils, and inhibition of the release of inflammatory mediators (possibly interleukin-1 from activated macrophages) and neuropepetides.</p><p><br/></p><p>n-vitro studies show that the ingredients of Traumeel® Injection Solution are non-cytotoxic to granulocytes, lymphocytes, platelets, and endothelia, which indicates that the defensive functions of these cells are preserved during treatment with Traumeel® Injection Solution.</p><p><br/></p><p>The anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-edematous, and anti exudative effects of Traumeel® Injection Solution have been demonstrated in clinical trials as well as in-vivo experimental models including the carrageenin-induced edema test and the adjuvant arthritis test.</p><h2>DOSAGE</h2><p class="First">Injections: 2.2ml ampule<br/></p><h2>PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL</h2><p class="First"></p><p>Traumeel_09.jpg</p><p class="ddc-disclaimer-link">Medical Disclaimer</p></body></html>
