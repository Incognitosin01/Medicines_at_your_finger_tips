In dose-ranging studies in patients with acute leukemia, fludarabine was associated with severe neurologic effects, including blindness, coma, and death. Life-threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia/thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Evan's syndrome, and acquired hemophilia has been reported to occur after one or more cycles of treatment. Closely monitor patients for hemolysis. In a clinical investigation using fludarabine for injection in combination with pentostatin (deoxycoformycin) for the treatment of refractory CLL, there was an unacceptably high incidence of fatal pulmonary toxicity. Therefore, the use of fludarabine for injection in combination with pentostatin is not recommended .</p><p>Available Dosage Forms:</p><ul>

It is used to treat a type of cancer of the white blood cells called B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Fludarabine is used in patients with CLL who have already been treated with an alkylating agent (e.g., bendamustine) that did not work well. .</p><p>Fludarabine injection interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by fludarabine injection, other effects may also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur for months or years after the medicine is used.</p><p>Before you begin treatment with fludarabine injection, you and your doctor should talk about the good fludarabine will do as well as the risks of using it.</p><p>Fludarabine injection is to be administered only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using fludarabine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For fludarabine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to fludarabine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of fludarabine injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of fludarabine injection in geriatric patients.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of fludarabine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Bone marrow problems (e.g., anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia)—Fludarabine injection may worsen these conditions.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Chickenpox (including recent exposure) or</li>
<li>Herpes zoster (shingles)—Risk of severe disease affecting other parts of the body.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Gout (history of) or</li>
<li>Kidney stones (history of)—Fludarabine may increase levels of uric acid in the body, which can cause gout or kidney stones.</li>
</ul><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of fludarabine</h2><p>Fludarabine may cause nausea and vomiting. However, it is very important that you continue to receive the medicine even if you begin to feel ill. Ask your doctor for ways to lessen these effects.</p><p>You will receive fludarabine while you are in a hospital or cancer treatment center. A nurse or other trained health professional will give you fludarabine.</p><p>Fludarabine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins. It is usually given every day for 5 days. This 5-day treatment is given again every 28 days until your body responds to the medicine. Each treatment usually takes about 30 minutes.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using fludarabine</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that fludarabine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>While you are being treated with fludarabine injection, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Fludarabine injection may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have recently taken oral polio vaccine. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.</p><p>Fludarabine injection can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection (e.g. pneumonia). It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you have fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, painful or difficult urination; shortness of breath; or unusual bleeding or bruising.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; blood in the urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>You should not use fludarabine if you are also taking pentostatin (Nipent®). Taking it together with fludarabine may increase the chance of serious side effect.</p><p>Fludarabine may cause a serious type of reaction called tumor lysis syndrome. Your doctor may give you a medicine to help prevent this. Call your doctor right away if you have a decrease or change in urine amount; joint pain, stiffness, or swelling; lower back, side, or stomach pain; a rapid weight gain; swelling of the feet or lower legs; or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Using fludarabine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant. You should not become pregnant while you are taking fludarabine and for 6 months after stopping it. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Fludarabine may cause unusual weakness, trouble in thinking, or trouble in seeing clearly. <i>Make sure you know how you react to fludarabine before you drive, use machines, or do other jobs that require you to be alert, well-coordinated, or able to think or see well</i>.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Fludarabine side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
