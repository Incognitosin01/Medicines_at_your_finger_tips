Sulfur acts as a keratolytic agent. Chemically sodium sulfacetamide is N-[(4-aminophenyl)sulfonyl]-acetamide, monosodium salt, monohydrate. The structural formula is:</p><p>Each gram of SSS 10 - 5 Emollient Foam contains 100 mg of Sodium Sulfacetamide and 50 mg of Sulfur in an aqueous based emollient foam vehicle containing: Butane, Butylene Glycol, Cellulose Gum, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Polysorbate 20, Propane, Titanium Dioxide, Water.</p><h2>Sodium Sulfacetamide and Sulfur Foam - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Sodium sulfacetamide exhibits antibacterial activity. The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods-Fildes theory, which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth.While absorption through intact skin has not been determined, sodium sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine, largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours. The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown, but it is reported to result from the interaction of sulfur with the cysteine content of keratinocytes. Furthermore, in combination with sulfacetamide, sulfur has been reported to inhibit the growth of <span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes,</span> thereby adding to the product’s antibacterial activity and reducing associated inflammation.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">SSS 10 - 5 Emollient Foam is indicated in the topical control of acne vulgaris, acne rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">SSS 10 - 5 Emollient Foam is contraindicated for use by patients having known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, sulfur or any other component of this preparation.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur when a sulfonamide is readministered, irrespective of the route of administration. At the first sign of hypersensitivity or skin rash, discontinue use of this preparation. Particular caution should be employed if areas of involved skin to be treated are denuded or abraded.</p><h2>FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.</h2><p class="First">Keep away from eyes.
