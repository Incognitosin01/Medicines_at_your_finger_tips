Chemically sodium sulfacetamide is N-[(4-aminophenyl) sulfonyl]-acetamide, monosodium salt, monohydrate. The structural formula is:</p><p>Each mg of <span class="Bold">Sumaxin<span class="Sup">®</span> (sodium sulfacetamide 9% &amp; sulfur 4%) Wash</span> contains 90 mg of sodium sulfacetamide and 40 mg of sulfur in a formulation consisting of: aloe, butylated hydroxytoluene, cetyl alcohol, disodium oleamido MEA sulfosuccinate, edetate disodium, fragrance, glyceryl stearate/PEG-100 stearate, green tea, magnesium aluminum silicate, methylparaben, propylparaben, purified water, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, sodium thiosulfate, stearyl alcohol, xanthan gum.</p><h2>Sumaxin Wash - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods-Fildes theory, which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth. While absorption through intact skin has not been determined, sodium sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine, largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours. The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown, but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of Propionibacterium acnes and the formation of free fatty acids.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Sumaxin<span class="Sup">®</span> (sodium sulfacetamide 9% &amp; sulfur 4%) Wash</span> is indicated for the topical control of acne vulgaris, acne rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Sumaxin<span class="Sup">®</span> (sodium sulfacetamide 9% &amp; sulfur 4%) Wash</span> is contraindicated for use by patients having known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, sulfur or any other component of this preparation. <span class="Bold">Sumaxin<span class="Sup">®</span> (sodium sulfacetamide 9% &amp; sulfur 4%) Wash</span> is not to be used by patients with kidney disease.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Although rare, sensitivity to sodium sulfacetamide may occur. Therefore, caution and careful supervision should be observed when prescribing this drug for patients who may be prone to hypersensitivity to topical sulfonamides. Systemic toxic reactions such as agranulocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, purpura hemorrhagica, drug fever, jaundice, and contact dermatitis indicate hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Particular caution should be employed if areas of denuded or abraded skin are involved.</p><p><span class="Bold">FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.</span> Keep away from eyes. Keep out of reach of children. Keep container tightly closed.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">If irritation develops, use of the product should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Patients should be carefully observed for possible local irritation or sensitization during long-term therapy. The object of this therapy is to achieve desquamation without irritation, but sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur can cause reddening and scaling of the epidermis. These side effects are not unusual in the treatment of acne vulgaris, but patients should be cautioned about the possibility.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, lips and mucous membranes. If accidental contact occurs, rinse with water. If excessive irritation develops, discontinue use and consult your physician.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p><h3>PREGNANCY</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with <span class="Bold">Sumaxin<span class="Sup">®</span> (sodium sulfacetamide 9% &amp; sulfur 4%) Wash</span>. It is also not known whether <span class="Bold">Sumaxin<span class="Sup">®</span> (sodium sulfacetamide 9% &amp; sulfur 4%) Wash</span> can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. <span class="Bold">Sumaxin<span class="Sup">®</span> (sodium sulfacetamide 9% &amp; sulfur 4%) Wash</span> should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>NURSING MOTHERS</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether sodium sulfacetamide is excreted in the human milk following topical use of <span class="Bold">Sumaxin<span class="Sup">®</span> (sodium sulfacetamide 9% &amp; sulfur 4%) Wash</span>. However, small amounts of orally administered sulfonamides have been reported to be eliminated in human milk. In view of this and because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when <span class="Bold">Sumaxin<span class="Sup">®</span> (sodium sulfacetamide 9% &amp; sulfur 4%) Wash</span> are administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>PEDIATRIC USE</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children under the age of 12 have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Although rare, sodium sulfacetamide may cause local irritation.</p><h2>Sumaxin Wash Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Apply <span class="Bold">Sumaxin<span class="Sup">®</span> (sodium sulfacetamide 9% &amp; sulfur 4%) Wash</span> once or twice daily to affected areas, or as directed by your physician.
