</ul><p class="First">10% Calcium Chloride Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, hypertonic solution. Each mL contains 100 mg (1.4 mEq/mL) of Calcium Chloride, dihydrate (1.4 mEq each of Ca++ and Cl−) in water for injection. It is provided in a 10 mL Unit of Use Syringe to facilitate prompt intravenous injection. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is intended for use only as a single-dose injection. The pH of 10% Calcium Chloride Injection, USP is 5.5 to 7.5 when diluted with water for injection to make a 5% solution. May contain hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The osmolar concentration is 2.04 mOsmol/mL (calc.). 10% Calcium Chloride Injection, USP is oxygen sensitive.</p><p>Calcium Chloride, USP dihydrate is chemically designated CaCl2 • 2H2O (dihydrate) and is described as white, odorless fragments or granules freely soluble in water.</p><p>The plastic syringe is molded from a specially formulated polypropylene. Water permeates from inside the container at an extremely slow rate which will have an insignificant effect on solution concentration over the expected shelf life. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach our certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the syringe material.</p><p class="First">Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the body and the major fraction is in the bony structure. Calcium plays important physiological roles, many of which are poorly understood. It is essential for the functional integrity of the nervous and muscular systems. It is necessary for normal cardiac function and is one of the factors that operate in the mechanisms involved in the coagulation of blood.</p><p>Calcium Chloride in water dissociates to provide calcium (Ca++) and chloride (Cl−) ions. They are normal constituents of the body fluids and are dependent on various physiological mechanisms for maintenance of balance between intake and output. Approximately 80% of body calcium is excreted in the feces as insoluble salts; urinary excretion accounts for the remaining 20%.</p><p>10% Calcium Chloride Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of hypocalcemia in those conditions requiring a prompt increase in plasma calcium levels.</p><p class="First">10% Calcium Chloride Injection, USP is irritating to veins and must not be injected into tissues, since severe necrosis and sloughing may occur. Great care should be taken to avoid extravasation or accidental injection into perivascular tissues.</p><p>WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.</p><p>Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.</p><p class="First">Do not administer unless solution is clear and seal is intact. Discard unused portion.</p><p>Because of its additive effect, calcium should be administered very cautiously to a patient who is digitalized or who is taking effective doses of digitalis or digitalis-like preparations.</p><p>Injections should be made slowly through a small needle into a large vein to minimize venous irritation and avoid undesirable reactions. It is particularly important to prevent a high concentration of calcium from reaching the heart because of the danger of cardiac syncope.</p><p class="First">Studies with solutions in polypropylene syringes have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility.</p><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness are based on similar clinical conditions in children and adults.</p><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Calcium Chloride. It also is not known whether Calcium Chloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Calcium Chloride should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><p class="First">An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p class="First">None known.</p><p class="First">Too rapid injection may produce lowering of blood pressure and cardiac syncope. Persistent hypercalcemia from overdosage of calcium is unlikely because of rapid excretion. In the event of untoward effects from excessive calcium administration, the drug should be discontinued promptly, the patient re-evaluated and appropriate countermeasures instituted, if necessary.

Do not freeze.</p><p class="First">Medical literature also refers to the administration of Calcium Chloride in the treatment of magnesium intoxication due to overdosage of magnesium sulfate, and to combat the deleterious effects of hyperkalemia as measured by electrocardiogram (ECG), pending correction of the increased potassium level in the extracellular fluid. However, adequate well-controlled, randomized clinical studies have not been done to support these indications.</p><p class="First">Container Label</p><p class="First">Pouch Label</p><p class="First">Carton Label</p><p class="First"></p><p class="First"></p><p class="First"></p><h2>More about calcium chloride</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
