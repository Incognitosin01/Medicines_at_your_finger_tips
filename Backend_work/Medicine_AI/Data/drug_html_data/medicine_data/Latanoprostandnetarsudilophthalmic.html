You may also notice increased growth or thickness of your eyelashes. These changes occur slowly and you may not notice them for months or years. Color changes may be permanent even after your treatment ends, and may occur only in the eye being treated. This could result in a cosmetic difference in eye or eyelash color from one eye to the other.</p><p>Latanoprost and netarsudil ophthalmic is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.</p><h2>How should I use latanoprost and netarsudil ophthalmic?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>The usual dose of this medicine is 1 drop into the affected eye every evening. Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully.</p><p>Tell your doctor right away if you have an eye injury or eye infection, or if you plan to have eye surgery.</p><p>Do not use while wearing soft contact lenses. A preservative in this medicine could permanently stain the lenses. Use the medicine at least 15 minutes before inserting your contact lenses.</p><p>Wash your hands before using eye medication.</p><p>To apply the eye drops: Tilt your head back slightly and pull down your lower eyelid to create a small pocket.
