Lipids can build up in the body, causing symptoms such as easy bruising or bleeding, weakness, anemia, bone or joint pain, enlarged liver or spleen, or weakened bones that are easily fractured.</p><p>Cerdelga is used to treat mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease in adults. It is used only if a specific liver enzyme (2D6) in your body breaks down or metabolizes drugs at a certain rate.</p><p>Cerdelga may improve the condition of the liver, spleen, bones, and blood cells in people with Type I Gaucher disease. <b>However, eliglustat is not a cure for this condition.</b></p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Cerdelga if you have severe liver or kidney disease.</p><p><b>Cerdelga can cause a serious heart problem, especially if you use certain other medicines at the same time.</b> Tell your doctor about all medicines you use.</p><p><b>Tell your doctor about all other medicines you use.</b> Some drugs can raise or lower your blood levels of eliglustat, which may cause side effects or make eliglustat less effective.
