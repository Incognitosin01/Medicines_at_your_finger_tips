See CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS sections.</p><h2>Ketoconazole Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Ketoconazole Tablets, USP is a synthetic broad-spectrum antifungal agent available in scored white tablets, each containing 200 mg ketoconazole base for oral administration. Inactive ingredients are colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate and methylcellulose. Ketoconazole is cis-1-acetyl-4-[4-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl] methoxyl]phenyl] piperazine and has the following structural formula:</p><p>Ketoconazole is a white to slightly beige, odorless powder, soluble in acids, with a molecular weight of 531.44g/mol.</p><h2>Ketoconazole Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Ketoconazole is a weak dibasic agent and thus requires acidity for dissolution and absorption.</p><p>Mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.5 mcg/mL are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. Oral bioavailability is maximal when the tablets are taken with a meal.</p><p>Absorption of Ketoconazole Tablets is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) and gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g. H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See Section PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) Absorption of ketoconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when Ketoconazole Tablets are administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola). After pretreatment with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, the bioavailability of a single 200 mg dose of ketoconazole under fasted conditions was decreased to 17% of the bioavailability of ketoconazole administered alone. When ketoconazole was administered with non-diet cola after pretreatment with omeprazole, the bioavailability was 65% of that after administration of ketoconazole alone.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>In vitro, the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction.</p><p>Ketoconazole is widely distributed into tissues; however, only a negligible proportion reaches the cerebrospinal fluid.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, Ketoconazole Tablets are converted into several inactive metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ketoconazole. The major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, by hepatic microsomal enzymes. In addition, oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation does occur. Ketoconazole has not been demonstrated to induce its own metabolism.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Elimination from plasma is biphasic with a half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours thereafter. Approximately 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2 to 4% is unchanged drug. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract with about 57% being excreted in the feces.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment</span></span></p><p>In patients with hepatic or renal impairment, the overall pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole was not significantly different when compared with healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span></span></p><p>Limited pharmacokinetic data are available on the use of Ketoconazole Tablets in the pediatric population.</p><p>Measurable ketoconazole plasma concentrations have been observed in pre-term infants (single or daily doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg) and in pediatric patients 5 months of age and older (daily doses of 3 to 13 mg/kg) when the drug was administered as a suspension, tablet or crushed tablet. Limited data suggest that absorption may be greater when the drug is administered as a suspension compared to a crushed tablet. Conditions that raise gastric pH may lower or prevent absorption (See Section PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS). Maximum plasma concentrations occurred 1 to 2 hours after dosing and were in the same general range as those seen in adults who received a 200 to 400 mg dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Electrocardiogram</span></p><p>Pre-clinical electrophysiological studies have shown that ketoconazole inhibits the rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current, prolongs the action potential duration, and may prolong the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval. Data from some clinical PK/PD studies and drug interaction studies suggest that oral dosing with ketoconazole at 200 mg twice daily for 3 to 7 days can result in an increase of the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval: a mean maximum increase of about 6 to 12 msec was seen at ketoconazole peak plasma concentrations about 1 to 4 hours after ketoconazole administration.</p><h2>MICROBIOLOGY</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>Ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14Î±-demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane.</p><p><span class="Bold">Activity In Vitro &amp; In Vivo</span></p><p>Ketoconazole Tablets USP, 200 mg are active against clinical infections with <span class="Italics">Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Ketoconazole Tablets</h2><p class="First">Ketoconazole Tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections.</p><p>Ketoconazole Tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks.</p><p>Ketoconazole Tablets are indicated for the treatment of the following systemic fungal infections in patients who have failed or who are intolerant to other therapies: blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, chromomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Ketoconazole Tablets should not be used for fungal meningitis because it penetrates poorly into the cerebrospinal fluid.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates such as dofetilide, quinidine cisapride and pimozide is contraindicated with Ketoconazole Tablets. Coadministration with ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects to such an extent that a potentially serious adverse reaction may occur. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.)</p><p>Additionally, the following other drugs are contraindicated with Ketoconazole Tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergometrine, irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, alprazolam, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone, lovastatin, simvastatin and colchicine. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.)</p><p><span class="Bold">Enhanced Sedation</span></p><p>Coadministration of Ketoconazole Tablets with oral midazolam, oral triazolam or alprazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Concomitant administration of Ketoconazole Tablets with oral triazolam, oral midazolam or alprazolam is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.)</p><p><span class="Bold">Myopathy</span></p><p>Coadministration of CYP3A4 metabolized HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin, and lovastatin is contraindicated with Ketoconazole Tablets. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.)</p><p><span class="Bold">Ergotism</span></p><p>Concomitant administration of ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine and ergotamine with Ketoconazole Tablets is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.)</p><p><span class="Bold">Liver Disease</span></p><p>The use of Ketoconazole Tablets is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver disease.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hypersensitivity</span></p><p>Ketoconazole Tablets USP, 200 mg is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Because of the serious adverse reactions that have been reported in association with ketoconazole, including fatal hepatotoxicity, Ketoconazole Tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections.</p><p>Ketoconazole Tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatotoxicity</span></p><p>Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation, has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity was reported both by patients receiving high doses for short treatment durations and by patients receiving low doses for long durations.</p><p>The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of ketoconazole treatment. Cases of hepatitis have been reported in children.</p><p>At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving Ketoconazole Tablets.</p><p>Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential. During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment. If ALT values increase to a level above the upper limit of normal or 30 percent above baseline, or if the patient develops symptoms, ketoconazole treatment should be interrupted and a full set of liver tests should be obtained. Liver tests should be repeated to ensure normalization of values. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with restarting oral ketoconazole (rechallenge). If it is decided to restart oral ketoconazole, monitor the patient frequently to detect any recurring liver injury from the drug.</p><p><span class="Bold">QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation</span></p><p>Ketoconazole can prolong the QT interval. Co-administration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs which may prolong the QT interval, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adrenal Insufficiency</span></p><p>Ketoconazole Tablets decrease adrenal corticosteroid secretion at doses of 400 mg and higher. This effect is not shared with other azoles. The recommended dose of 200 mg to 400 mg daily should not be exceeded. Adrenal function should be monitored in patients with adrenal insufficiency or with borderline adrenal function and in patients under prolonged periods of stress (major surgery, intensive care, etc.).</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Associated with Unapproved Uses</span></p><p>Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings and the use of ketoconazole for these indications is not approved by FDA. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of Ketoconazole Tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether death was related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease.</p><p>Hepatoxicity, including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation, have been reported in patients who received ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hypersensitivity</span></p><p>Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p><p>Ketoconazole Tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with Ketoconazole Tablets has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Clinical manifestations of decreased testosterone concentrations may include gynecomastia, impotence and oligospermia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span></p><p>Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms which may suggest liver dysfunction so that appropriate biochemical testing can be done. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stools (see WARNINGS section).</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages.</p><p>Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown.</p><h3>Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations</h3><p class="First">Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from Ketoconazole Tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with Ketoconazole Tablets:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Ketoconazole Tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity.</li>
<li>Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of Ketoconazole Tablets.</li>
<li>Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the Ketoconazole Tablets dose increased as deemed necessary.</li>
</ul><p>Coadministration of Ketoconazole Tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under 'DRUGS THAT MAY HAVE THEIR PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED'), rifampicin.</li>
<li>Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under 'DRUGS THAT MAY HAVE THEIR PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED'), phenytoin.</li>
<li>Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine.</li>
</ul><p>Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with Ketoconazole Tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with Ketoconazole Tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the Ketoconazole Tablets dose increased as deemed necessary.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations</span></p><p>Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with Ketoconazole Tablets. Patients who must take Ketoconazole Tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the Ketoconazole Tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured.</p><h3>Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole</h3><p class="First">Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with Ketoconazole Tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia.</p><p>Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with Ketoconazole Tablets:</p><p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Ketoconazole did not show any signs of mutagenic potential when evaluated using the dominant lethal mutation test or the Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay. Ketoconazole was not carcinogenic in an 18-month, oral study in Swiss albino mice or a 24-month oral carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day. The high dose in these studies was approximately 1Ã (mouse) or 2Ã (rat) the clinical dose in humans based on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> comparison.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Teratogenic effects</span></p><p>Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels.</p><p>There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole Tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nonteratogenic Effects</span></p><p>Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation.</p><p>In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison).</p><p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span></p><p>Ketoconazole has been shown to be excreted in the milk. Mothers who are under treatment with Ketoconazole Tablets should not breast feed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span></p><p>Ketoconazole Tablets have not been systematically studied in children of any age, and essentially no information is available on children under 2 years. Ketoconazole Tablets should not be used in pediatric patients unless the potential benefit outweighs the risks.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The following adverse reactions were reported in clinical trials:</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune System Disorders:</span> anaphylactoid reaction</p><p><span class="Italics">Endocrine Disorders:</span> gynecomastia</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders:</span> alcohol intolerance, anorexia, hyperlipidemia, increased appetite</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric Disorders:</span> insomnia, nervousness</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System Disorders:</span> headache, dizziness, paresthesia, somnolence</p><p><span class="Italics">Eye Disorders:</span> photophobia</p><p><span class="Italics">Vascular Disorders:</span> orthostatic hypotension</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders:</span> epistaxis</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal Disorders:</span> vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, dry mouth, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, flatulence, tongue discoloration</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatobiliary Disorders:</span> hepatitis, jaundice, hepatic function abnormal</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissues Disorders:</span> erythema multiforme, rash, dermatitis, erythema, urticaria, pruritus, alopecia, xeroderma</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders:</span> myalgia</p><p><span class="Italics">Reproductive System and Breast Disorders:</span> menstrual disorder</p><p><span class="Italics">General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:</span> asthenia, fatigue, hot flush, malaise, edema peripheral, pyrexia, chills</p><p><span class="Italics">Investigations:</span> platelet count decreased.</p><p><span class="Bold">Post-Marketing Experience</span></p><p>The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Ketoconazole Tablets.
