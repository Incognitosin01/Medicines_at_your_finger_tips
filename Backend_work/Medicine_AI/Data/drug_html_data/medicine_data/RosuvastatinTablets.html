<li>Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any component of this product. Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema have been reported with Rosuvastatin Tablets <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></li>
<li>Patients with active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations of hepatic transaminase levels <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></li>
<li>Pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1,8.3)].</span></li>
<li>Lactation. Limited data indicate that rosuvastatin is present in human milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require Rosuvastatin Tablets treatment should not breastfeed their infants <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Skeletal Muscle Effects</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cases</span> <span class="Bold">of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including Rosuvastatin Tablets. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg</span><span class="Bold">)</span><span class="Bold">.</span></p><p>Rosuvastatin Tablets should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">The risk of myopathy during treatment with Rosuvastatin Tablets may be increased with concurrent administration of gemfibrozil, some other lipid-lowering therapies (other fibrates or niacin), cyclosporine, darolutamide, regorafenib, atazanavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, simeprevir or combination of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, all combinations with ledipasvir (including ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)</span> and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span> (<span class="Italics">7)]</span>. Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing Rosuvastatin Tablets with colchicine <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.9)]</span>.</span></p><p>Rosuvastatin Tablets therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated creatine kinase levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Rosuvastatin Tablets therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of myopathy or predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis, hypotension, dehydration, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled seizures).</p><p>All patients should be advised to promptly report to their physician unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing Rosuvastatin Tablets.</p><h3>5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Consider risk of IMNM carefully prior to initiation of a different statin. If therapy is initiated with a different statin, monitor for signs and symptoms of IMNM.</span></p><h3>Liver Enzyme Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before the initiation of Rosuvastatin Tablets, and if signs or symptoms of liver injury occur.</p><p>Increases in serum transaminases [AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT)] have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including Rosuvastatin Tablets. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to Rosuvastatin Tablets therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.</p><p>In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials, increases in serum transaminases to &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 1.1% of patients taking Rosuvastatin Tablets versus 0.5% of patients treated with placebo.</p><p>There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including rosuvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with Rosuvastatin Tablets, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart Rosuvastatin Tablets.</p><p>Rosuvastatin Tablets should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of chronic liver disease <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent transaminase elevations, is a contraindication to the use of Rosuvastatin Tablets <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Concomitant Coumarin Anticoagulants</h3><p class="First">Caution should be exercised when anticoagulants are given in conjunction with Rosuvastatin Tablets because of its potentiation of the effect of coumarin-type anticoagulants in prolonging the prothrombin time/INR. In patients taking coumarin anticoagulants and Rosuvastatin Tablets concomitantly, INR should be determined before starting Rosuvastatin Tablets and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of INR occurs <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics"> Drug Interactions  (7.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Proteinuria and Hematuria</h3><p class="First">In the Rosuvastatin Tablets clinical trial program, dipstick-positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were observed among Rosuvastatin Tablets treated patients. These findings were more frequent in patients taking Rosuvastatin Tablets 40 mg, when compared to lower doses of Rosuvastatin Tablets or comparator HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, though it was generally transient and was not associated with worsening renal function. Although the clinical significance of this finding is unknown, a dose reduction should be considered for patients on Rosuvastatin Tablets therapy with unexplained persistent proteinuria and/or hematuria during routine urinalysis testing.</p><h3>Endocrine Effects</h3><p class="First">Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including Rosuvastatin Tablets. Based on clinical trial data with Rosuvastatin Tablets, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus <span class="Italics">[see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>Although clinical studies have shown that Rosuvastatin Tablets alone does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve, caution should be exercised if Rosuvastatin Tablets are administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria and acute renal failure and myopathy (including myositis) <span class="Italics">[see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Liver enzyme abnormalities <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.In the Rosuvastatin Tablets controlled clinical trials database (placebo or active-controlled) of 5394 patients with a mean treatment duration of 15 weeks, 1.4% of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>myalgia</li>
<li>abdominal pain</li>
<li>nausea</li>
</ul><p>The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥2%) in the Rosuvastatin Tablets controlled clinical trial database of 5394 patients were:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>headache</li>
<li>myalgia</li>
<li>abdominal pain</li>
<li>asthenia</li>
<li>nausea</li>
</ul><p>Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients in placebo-controlled clinical studies and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 1. These studies had a treatment duration of up to 12 weeks.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1.

The following laboratory abnormalities have also been reported: dipstick-positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>; elevated creatine phosphokinase, transaminases, glucose, glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin; and thyroid function abnormalities.</p><p>In a clinical trial, involving 981 participants treated with rosuvastatin 40 mg (n=700) or placebo (n=281) with a mean treatment duration of 1.7 years, 5.6% of subjects treated with Rosuvastatin Tablets versus 2.8% of placebo-treated subjects discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were: myalgia, hepatic enzyme increased, headache, and nausea.</p><p>Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 2.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2. Adverse Reactions<span class="Sup">1</span> Reported in ≥2% of Patients Treated with Rosuvastatin Tablets and &gt; Placebo in a Trial (% of Patients)</span></p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">1</span> Adverse reactions by MedDRA preferred term.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">2</span> Frequency recorded as abnormal laboratory value.</p><p>In a clinical trial, 17,802 participants were treated with rosuvastatin 20 mg (n=8901) or placebo (n=8901) for a mean duration of 2 years. A higher percentage of rosuvastatin-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients, 6.6% and 6.2%, respectively, discontinued study medication due to an adverse event, irrespective of treatment causality. Myalgia was the most common adverse reaction that led to treatment discontinuation.</p><p>There was a significantly higher frequency of diabetes mellitus reported in patients taking rosuvastatin (2.8%) versus patients taking placebo (2.3%). Mean HbA1c was significantly increased by 0.1% in rosuvastatin-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. The number of patients with a HbA1c &gt;6.5% at the end of the trial was significantly higher in rosuvastatin-treated versus placebo-treated patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><p>Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 3.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3. Adverse Reactions<span class="Sup">1</span> Reported in ≥2% of Patients Treated with Rosuvastatin Tablets and &gt; Placebo in a Trial (% of Patients)</span></p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">1</span> Treatment-emergent adverse reactions by MedDRA preferred term.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Rosuvastatin Tablets: arthralgia, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure, hepatitis, jaundice, thrombocytopenia, depression, sleep disorders (including insomnia and nightmares), peripheral neuropathy, interstitial lung disease and gynecomastia. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><p>There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, and confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks).</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Cyclosporine</h3><p class="First">Cyclosporine increased rosuvastatin exposure and may result in increased risk of myopathy. Therefore, in patients taking cyclosporine, the dose of Rosuvastatin Tablets should not exceed 5 mg once daily <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span>, <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and</span><span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Gemfibrozil</h3><p class="First">Gemfibrozil significantly increased rosuvastatin exposure. Due to an observed increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis, combination therapy with Rosuvastatin Tablets and gemfibrozil should be avoided. If used together, the dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics"> Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Anti-viral Medications</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of rosuvastatin with certain anti-viral drugs has differing effects on rosuvastatin exposure and may increase risk of myopathy.</p><p>The combination of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir which are anti-Hepatitis C virus (anti- HCV) drugs, increases rosuvastatin exposure. Similarly, the combination of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir may significantly increase rosuvastatin exposure. For these combinations of anti-HCV drugs, concomitant use with Rosuvastatin Tablets are not recommended.</p><p>Simeprevir and combinations of dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir which are anti-HCV drugs, increase rosuvastatin exposure. Combinations of atazanavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir, which are anti-HIV-1 drugs, increase rosuvastatin exposure <span class="Italics">[see Table 4</span><span class="Italics">Clinical</span> <span class="Italics">Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. For these anti-viral drugs, the dose of Rosuvastatin Tablets should not exceed 10 mg once daily.</p><p>The combinations of fosamprenavir/ritonavir or tipranavir/ritonavir, which are anti-HIV-1 drugs, produce little or no change in rosuvastatin exposure. No dose adjustment is needed for concomitant use with these combinations <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4</span><span class="Italics">),</span><span class="Italics">Warnings and  Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Darolutamide</h3><p class="First">Darolutamide increased rosuvastatin exposure more than 5 fold. Therefore, in patients taking darolutamide, the dose of Rosuvastatin Tablets should not exceed 5 mg once daily <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and  Administration (2.4)</span>, <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Regorafenib</h3><p class="First">Regorafenib increased rosuvastatin exposure and may increase the risk of myopathy. If used together, the dose of Rosuvastatin Tablets should not exceed 10 mg once daily <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and  Administration (2.4)</span>, <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Coumarin Anticoagulants</h3><p class="First">Rosuvastatin Tablets significantly increased INR in patients receiving coumarin anticoagulants. Therefore, caution should be exercised when coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with Rosuvastatin Tablets. In patients taking coumarin anticoagulants and Rosuvastatin Tablets concomitantly, INR should be determined before starting Rosuvastatin Tablets and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of INR occurs <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Niacin</h3><p class="First">The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when Rosuvastatin Tablets are used in combination with lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day) of niacin; caution should be used when prescribing with Rosuvastatin Tablets <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Fenofibrate</h3><p class="First">When Rosuvastatin Tablets were coadministered with fenofibrate, no clinically significant increase in the AUC of rosuvastatin or fenofibrate was observed. Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concomitant use of fenofibrates, caution should be used when prescribing fenofibrates with Rosuvastatin Tablets <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics">  Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span></p><h3>Colchicine</h3><p class="First">Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing Rosuvastatin Tablets with colchicine <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Rosuvastatin Tablets are contraindicated for use in pregnant women since safety in pregnant women has not been established and there is no apparent benefit to therapy with Rosuvastatin Tablets during pregnancy. Because HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol, Rosuvastatin Tablets may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Rosuvastatin Tablets should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span>Limited published data on the use of rosuvastatin are insufficient to determine a drug-associated risk of major congenital malformations or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects with oral administration of rosuvastatin during organogenesis at systemic exposures equivalent to a maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg/day in rats or rabbits (based on AUC and body surface area, respectively). In rats and rabbits, decreased pup/fetal survival occurred at 12 times and equivalent, respectively, to the MRHD of 40 mg/day [see Data].</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></span></p><p>Limited published data on rosuvastatin have not shown an increased risk of major congenital malformations or miscarriage. Rare reports of congenital anomalies have been received following intrauterine exposure to other statins. In a review of approximately 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to simvastatin or lovastatin, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deaths/stillbirths did not exceed what would be expected in the general population. The number of cases is adequate to exclude a ≥3 to 4-fold increase in congenital anomalies over the background incidence. In 89% of the prospectively followed pregnancies, drug treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></span></p><p>Rosuvastatin crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits and is found in fetal tissue and amniotic fluid at 3% and 20%, respectively, of the maternal plasma concentration following a single 25 mg/kg oral gavage dose on gestation day 16 in rats. A higher fetal tissue distribution (25% maternal plasma concentration) was observed in rabbits after a single oral gavage dose of 1 mg/kg on gestation day 18.</p><p>Rosuvastatin administration did not indicate a teratogenic effect in rats at ≤25 mg/kg/day or in rabbits ≤3 mg/kg/day (doses equivalent to the MRHD of 40 mg/day based on AUC and body surface area, respectively).</p><p>In female rats given 5, 15 and 50 mg/kg/day before mating and continuing through to gestation day 7 resulted in decreased fetal body weight (female pups) and delayed ossification at 50 mg/kg/day (10 times the human exposure at the MRHD dose of 40 mg/day based on AUC).</p><p>In pregnant rats given 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 7 through lactation day 21 (weaning), decreased pup survival occurred at 50 mg/kg/day (dose equivalent to 12 times the MRHD of 40 mg/day based body surface area).</p><p>In pregnant rabbits given 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 6 to day 18, decreased fetal viability and maternal mortality was observed at 3 mg/kg/day (dose equivalent to the MRHD of 40 mg/day based on body surface area).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Rosuvastatin use is contraindicated during breastfeeding <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Limited data indicate that rosuvastatin is present in human milk. There is no available information on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Rosuvastatin Tablets.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Contraception</span></p><p>Rosuvastatin Tablets may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific  Populations (8.1)].</span> Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Rosuvastatin Tablets.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric use information for patients 7 to 17 years of age is approved for AstraZeneca's CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium) tablets.

Chronic alcohol liver disease is known to increase rosuvastatin exposure; Rosuvastatin Tablets should be used with caution in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)</span>, <span class="Italics">Warning and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology(12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Asian Patients</h3><p class="First">Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated an approximate 2-fold increase in median exposure to rosuvastatin in Asian subjects when compared with Caucasian controls. Rosuvastatin Tablets dosage should be adjusted in Asian patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical  Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no specific treatment in the event of overdose. In the event of overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required. Hemodialysis does not significantly enhance clearance of rosuvastatin.</p><h2>Rosuvastatin Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Rosuvastatin calcium, USP is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent for oral administration.</p><p>The chemical name for rosuvastatin calcium, USP is bis[(E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2  [methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino] pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid] calcium salt with the following structural formula:</p><p>The empirical formula for rosuvastatin calcium, USP is (C<span class="Sub">22</span>H<span class="Sub">27</span>FN<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span>S)<span class="Sub">2</span>Ca and the molecular weight is 1001.14. Rosuvastatin calcium, USP is a white amorphous powder that is sparingly soluble in water and methanol, and slightly soluble in ethanol. Rosuvastatin calcium, USP is a hydrophilic compound with a partition coefficient (octanol/water) of 0.13 at pH of 7.0.</p><p>Rosuvastatin Tablets, USP for oral administration contain 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg of rosuvastatin and the following inactive ingredients: Each tablet contains: carboxymethylcellulose calcium, hypromellose, iron oxide red, iron oxide yellow, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, titanium dioxide and triacetin.</p><p>FDA approved dissolution test specifications differ from USP.</p><h2>Rosuvastatin Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Rosuvastatin is a selective and competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. <span class="Italics">In vivo</span> studies in animals, and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies in cultured animal and human cells have shown rosuvastatin to have a high uptake into, and selectivity for, action in the liver, the target organ for cholesterol lowering. In <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies, rosuvastatin produces its lipid-modifying effects in two ways. First, it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell-surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL. Second, rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL, which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Rosuvastatin Tablets dose dependently reduces elevated LDL-cholesterol and reduces total cholesterol and triglycerides and increases HDL-cholesterol <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. A therapeutic response to Rosuvastatin Tablets are evident within 1 week of commencing therapy and 90% of maximum response is usually achieved in 2 weeks. The maximum response is usually achieved by 4 weeks and is maintained after that. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on the therapeutic response <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>In clinical pharmacology studies in man, peak plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were reached 3 to 5 hours following oral dosing. Both Cmax and AUC increased in approximate proportion to Rosuvastatin Tablets dose. The absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is approximately 20%.</p><p>Administration of Rosuvastatin Tablets with food did not affect the AUC of rosuvastatin.</p><p>The AUC of rosuvastatin does not differ following evening or morning drug administration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Mean volume of distribution at steady-state of rosuvastatin is approximately 134 liters. Rosuvastatin is 88% bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. This binding is reversible andindependent of plasma concentrations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Rosuvastatin is primarily eliminated by excretion in the feces. The elimination half-life of rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></span></p><p>Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized; approximately 10% of a radiolabeled dose is recovered as metabolite. The major metabolite is N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, which is formed principally by cytochrome P450 \ 2C9, and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies have demonstrated that N-desmethyl rosuvastatin has approximately one-sixth to one-half the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound. Overall, greater than 90% of active plasma HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is accounted for by the parent compound.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Following oral administration, rosuvastatin and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces (90%). After an intravenous dose, approximately 28% of total body clearance was via the renal route, and 72% by the hepatic route.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Racial</span> <span class="Italics">or Ethnic Groups</span></p><p>A population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics among Caucasian, Hispanic, and Black or Afro-Caribbean groups.

In patients with Child-Pugh B disease, Cmax and AUC were increased 100% and 21%, respectively, compared with patients with normal liver function.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions Studies</span></p><p>Rosuvastatin clearance is not dependent on metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 to a clinically significant extent.</p><p>Rosuvastatin is a substrate for certain transporter proteins including the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion-transporting polyprotein 1B1 (OATP1B1) and efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Concomitant administration of Rosuvastatin Tablets with medications that are inhibitors of these transporter proteins (e.g. cyclosporine, certain HIV protease inhibitors) may result in increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and  Administration (2.4)</span><span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Drug</span> <span class="Italics">Interactions (7.1, 7.3)]</span>.</p><p class="First Footnote">QD= Once daily, BID= Twice daily, TID= Three times daily, QID= Four times daily</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Italics">1</span> Single dose unless otherwise noted.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Italics">2</span> Clinically significant <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)and Warnings and Precautions (5)]</span></p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Italics">3</span> Mean ratio with 90% CI (with/without coadministered drug, e.g., 1= no change, 0.7 = 30% decrease, 11=11 fold increase in exposure)</p><p class="First Footnote">EE = ethinyl estradiol, NG = norgestrel, QD= Once daily</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">1</span> Clinically significant pharmacodynamic effects <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">2</span> Mean ratio with 90% CI (with/without coadministered drug, e.g., 1= no change, 0.7=30% decrease, 11=11-fold increase in exposure)</p><h3>Pharmacogenomics</h3><p class="First">Disposition of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, involves OATP1B1 and other transporter proteins. Higher plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin have been reported in very small groups of patients (n=3 to 5) who have two reduced function alleles of the gene that encodes OATP1B1 (<span class="Italics">SLCO1B1</span> 521T &gt; C). The frequency of this genotype (i.e., <span class="Italics">SLCO1B1</span> 521 C/C) is generally lower than 5% in most racial/ethnic groups. The impact of this polymorphism on efficacy and/or safety of rosuvastatin has not been clearly established.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 2, 20, 60, or 80 mg/kg/day by oral gavage, the incidence of uterine stromal polyps was significantly increased in females at 80 mg/kg/day at systemic exposure 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC. Increased incidence of polyps was not seen at lower doses.</p><p>In a 107-week carcinogenicity study in mice given 10, 60, or 200 mg/kg/day by oral gavage, an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma was observed at 200 mg/kg/day at systemic exposures 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC. An increased incidence of hepatocellular tumors was not seen at lower doses.</p><p>Rosuvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames test with <span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span> and <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>, the mouse lymphoma assay, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Rosuvastatin was negative in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus test.</p><p>In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 5, 15, 50 mg/kg/day, males were treated for 9 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout mating until gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 50 mg/kg/day (systemic exposures up to 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC). In testicles of dogs treated with rosuvastatin at 30 mg/kg/day for one month, spermatidic giant cells were seen. Spermatidic giant cells were observed in monkeys after 6-month treatment at 30 mg/kg/day in addition to vacuolation of seminiferous tubular epithelium. Exposures in the dog were 20 times and in the monkey 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on body surface area. Similar findings have been seen with other drugs in this class.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Central Nervous System Toxicity</span></p><p>CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with several other members of this drug class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced dose-dependent optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in dogs, at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. Edema, hemorrhage, and partial necrosis in the interstitium of the choroid plexus was observed in a female dog sacrificed moribund at day 24 at 90 mg/kg/day by oral gavage (systemic exposures 100 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC). Corneal opacity was seen in dogs treated for 52 weeks at 6 mg/kg/day by oral gavage (systemic exposures 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC).</p><p>Cataracts were seen in dogs treated for 12 weeks by oral gavage at 30 mg/kg/day (systemic exposures 60 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC). Retinal dysplasia and retinal loss were seen in dogs treated for 4 weeks by oral gavage at 90 mg/kg/day (systemic exposures 100 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC). Doses ≤30 mg/kg/day (systemic exposures ≤60 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC) did not reveal retinal findings during treatment for up to one year.</p><p><span class="Bold">Juvenile Toxicology Study</span></p><p>In a juvenile study, rats were dosed by oral gavage with 10 or 50 mg/kg/day from weaning for 9 weeks prior to pairing, throughout pairing and up to the day before necropsy for males or up to gestation day 7 for females.
