This medicine is not for treating pain that is not cancer-related, such as migraine headaches or pain after surgery.</p><p>Actiq may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Actiq can slow or stop your breathing, and may be habit-forming.

Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks.</p><p>Fentanyl can pass into breast milk and may cause sleepiness or breathing problems in a nursing baby. Fentanyl may also cause withdrawal symptoms in a nursing infant. <b>Do not breast-feed while using Actiq.</b></p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use Actiq?</h2><p>Use Actiq exactly as prescribed. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Never use this medicine in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain.</p><p>Fentanyl may be habit-forming. <b>Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. <b>Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law.</b></p><p>Fentanyl can slow or stop your breathing. <b>MISUSE OF ACTIQ CAN CAUSE DEATH, especially in a child who gets a hold of an Actiq unit and places it in the mouth.</b> Read all patient instructions carefully before using this medicine.</p><p>The Actiq transmucosal unit is a fentanyl citrate lozenge attached to a plastic handle. Each unit is wrapped in a child-proof blister pack. Cut the blister pack open with scissors when you are ready to use the unit.</p><p>Place the medicine in your mouth between your cheek and gum, and hold the handle with your fingers. Twirl the handle to move the medicine around in your mouth while sucking on it.</p><p>Allow the medicine to dissolve in your mouth for 15 minutes. Swallow when needed. Do not bite or chew the lozenge. Do not eat or drink anything while the unit is in your mouth. If you need to use a second unit, wait at least 15 minutes after you have finished the first unit. Use only 1 Actiq unit at a time.</p><p>If you feel dizzy or sick to your stomach before the medicine has completely dissolved, stop using the unit and call your doctor.</p><p>Do not stop using any other pain medicines your doctor has prescribed for you.</p><p>If you switch from using Actiq to using other forms of fentanyl, you will not use the same dose. Many forms of fentanyl are given at lower doses than Actiq. If you use the same dose of each medication, you may have life-threatening overdose symptoms.</p><p>Pay special attention to your dental hygiene. Actiq can cause dry mouth leading to tooth decay.</p><p>Do not stop using fentanyl suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Leave each unit in its child-proof blister pack until you are ready to use it.</p><p>Keep track of your medicine. Fentanyl citrate is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Keep both used and unused Actiq units out of the reach of children or pets. <b>The amount of fentanyl citrate in the Actiq unit can be fatal to a child who accidentally sucks on or swallows the unit.</b> Seek emergency medical attention if this happens.</p><p>Actiq comes with a kit and instructions for storing and disposing of the Actiq units.</p><p>Do not keep leftover opioid medication. <b>Just one dose can cause death in someone using this medicine accidentally or improperly.</b> Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, follow the instructions provided with Actiq when disposing of unused medicine.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Actiq is used for pain, you are not likely to miss a dose. Skip any missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>A fentanyl overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Overdose symptoms may include slow breathing and heart rate, severe drowsiness, muscle weakness, cold and clammy skin, pinpoint pupils, and fainting.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using Actiq?</h2><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><p>Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medicine will affect you. Dizziness or severe drowsiness can cause falls or other accidents.</p><p>Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may interact with fentanyl and lead to unwanted side effects. Discuss the use of grapefruit products with your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Actiq side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Actiq:</b> hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Like other narcotic medicines, fentanyl can slow your breathing.
