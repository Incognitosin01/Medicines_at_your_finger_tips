</li>
<li>
<p>a urea cycle disorder; or</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>liver problems caused by a genetic mitochondrial disorder;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a history of depression, mental illness, or suicidal thoughts or actions;</p>

<p>a family history of a urea cycle disorder or infant deaths with unknown cause; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HIV or CMV (cytomegalovirus) infection.</p>

</ul><p>liver problems caused by a genetic mitochondrial disorder;</p><p>a history of depression, mental illness, or suicidal thoughts or actions;</p><p>a family history of a urea cycle disorder or infant deaths with unknown cause; or</p><p>HIV or CMV (cytomegalovirus) infection.</p><p>Some young people have thoughts about suicide when first taking Stavzor. Your doctor will need to check your progress at regular visits while you are using this medicine. Your family or other caregivers should also be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms.</p><p>Do not use Stavzor to prevent migraine headaches if you are pregnant.</p><p><b>If you take Stavzor for seizures or manic episodes:</b> valproic acid can harm an unborn baby or cause birth defects, and may affect cognitive ability (reasoning, intelligence, problem-solving) later in the child's life. However, having a seizure during pregnancy could harm both the mother and the baby. Do not start or stop taking valproic acid during pregnancy without your doctor's advice.</p><p><b>Use effective birth control while using Stavzor, and tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant.</b></p><p>Tell your doctor if you start or stop using hormonal contraception that contains estrogen (birth control pills, injections, implants, skin patches, and vaginal rings). Estrogen can interact with valproic acid and make it less effective in preventing seizures.</p><p>Seizure control is very important during pregnancy. The benefit of preventing seizures may outweigh any risks posed by taking Stavzor. There may be other seizure medications that can be more safely used during pregnancy. Follow your doctor's instructions about taking Stavzor while you are pregnant.</p><p>Valproic acid can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. You should not breast-feed while using this medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take Stavzor?</h2><p>Take Stavzor capsules exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Drink plenty of water while you are taking this medication. Your dose may need to be changed if you do not get enough fluids each day.</p><p>Take with food if this medicine upsets your stomach.</p><p>Do not crush, chew, break, or open a delayed-release capsule. Swallow it whole.</p><p>While using Stavzor, you may need frequent blood tests.</p><p>Wear a medical alert tag or carry an ID card stating that you take Stavzor. Any doctor, dentist, or emergency medical care provider who treats you should know that you are taking a seizure medication.</p><p>If you need surgery, tell the surgeon ahead of time that you are using valproic acid.</p><p>Do not stop using Stavzor suddenly, even if you feel fine. Stopping suddenly may cause a serious, life-threatening type of seizure. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the missed dose as soon as you remember.
