It is used in combination with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to allow blood vessels, organs, and other non-bony tissues to be seen more clearly on the MRI or MRA.</p><p>Gadobenate dimeglumine is used to help diagnose certain disorders of the brain and spine (central nervous system). This medication is also used to diagnose atherosclerosis (clogged arteries).</p><p>Gadobenate dimeglumine may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Gadobenate dimeglumine can cause a life-threatening condition in people with advanced kidney disease. <b>You should not receive this medication if you have kidney disease or if you are on dialysis</b>.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Gadobenate dimeglumine can cause a life-threatening condition in people with advanced kidney disease. <b>You should not receive this medication if you have kidney disease or if you are on dialysis</b>.</p><p>Gadobenate dimeglumine can stay in your body for months or years after you receive  gadobenate dimeglumine.
