This can slow bone loss and may help prevent bone fractures.</p><p>Pamidronate is used to treat Paget's disease of bone. Pamidronate is also used to treat high blood levels of calcium caused by cancer (also called hypercalcemia of malignancy).</p><p>Pamidronate is also used to treat bone damage caused by certain types of cancer such as breast cancer or bone marrow cancer. Pamidronate does not treat the cancer itself.</p><p>Pamidronate may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Pamidronate may harm an unborn baby.</b> Avoid getting pregnant while using  pamidronate and tell your doctor if you become pregnant.</p><p>Call your doctor if you have muscle spasms, numbness or tingling (in hands and feet or around the mouth), new or unusual hip pain, little or no urination, or swelling in your lower legs.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use this medicine if you are allergic to mannitol, or to any bisphosphonate (alendronate, etidronate, ibandronate, pamidronate, risedronate, tiludronate, or zoledronic acid).</p><p>To make sure pamidronate is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

</ul><p>an electrolyte imbalance (such as low levels of potassium or magnesium in your blood);</p><p>kidney disease;</p><p>liver disease; or</p><p>a dental problem (you may need a dental exam before you receive pamidronate).</p><p>In rare cases, this medicine may cause bone loss (osteonecrosis) in the jaw. Symptoms include jaw pain or numbness, red or swollen gums, loose teeth, or slow healing after dental work. The longer you use pamidronate, the more likely you are to develop this condition.</p><p>Osteonecrosis of the jaw may be more likely if you have cancer or received chemotherapy, radiation, or steroids. Other risk factors include blood clotting disorders, anemia (low red blood cells), and a pre-existing dental problem.</p><p><b>Pamidronate may harm an unborn baby.</b> Use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy while you are using this medicine. Tell your doctor if you become pregnant. You may also need to use birth control for several weeks after your last dose of pamidronate.

You should not breast-feed while you are using pamidronate.</p><p>Pamidronate is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old.</p><h2>How is pamidronate given?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not use  pamidronate in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Pamidronate is injected into a vein through an IV. You may be shown how to use an IV at home. Do not give yourself this medicine if you do not understand how to use the injection and properly dispose of needles, IV tubing, and other items used.</p><p>This medicine must be given slowly, and the infusion can take 2 to 24 hours to complete.</p><p>Pamidronate is sometimes given as a single dose only one time. It may also be repeated over 3 days in a row, or given once every 3 to 4 weeks. How often you receive pamidronate and the length of your infusion time will depend on why you are using this medicine. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Pamidronate is a powder medicine that must be mixed with a liquid (diluent) before using it. If you are using the injections at home, be sure you understand how to properly mix and store the medicine.</p><p>Never mix pamidronate with a solution that contains calcium (such as lactated Ringer's solution) or with other drugs in the same IV bag or line.</p><p>Your kidney function may need to be checked while you using pamidronate.</p><p>Pay special attention to your dental hygiene while using pamidronate. Brush and floss your teeth regularly. If you need to have any dental work (especially surgery), tell the dentist ahead of time that you are using pamidronate.</p><p>Pamidronate is only part of a complete program of treatment that may also include diet changes and taking calcium and vitamin supplements. Follow your doctor's instructions very closely.</p><p>Store pamidronate at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Mixed medicine must be used within 24 hours.</p><p>Each single-use vial (bottle) of this medicine is for one use only.
