</ul><h2>Felodipine Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Felodipine is a calcium antagonist (calcium channel blocker). Felodipine is a<br/>
dihydropyridine derivative that is chemically described as ± ethyl methyl<br/>
4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate.<br/>
Its molecular formula is C18H19Cl12NO4 and its structural formula is:</p><p></p><p>Felodipine, USP is a light yellow to yellow crystalline powder with a molecular<br/>
weight of 384.26. It is insoluble in water and is freely soluble in acetone and<br/>
in methanol; very slightly soluble in heptane. Felodipine is a racemic mixture.<br/>
Felodipine extended-release tablets, USP provide extended release of felodipine.<br/>
They are available as tablets containing 2.5 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg of felodipine,<br/>
USP for oral administration. Inactive ingredients are: lactose monohydrate,<br/>
hydroxypropyl cellulose, silicon dioxide colloidal, hypromellose, magnesium<br/>
stearate, calcium phosphate dibasic, butylated hydroxyanisole, polyethylene<br/>
glycol, titanuium dioxide. In addition, the 5 mg and the 10 mg tablet strength<br/>
contain FD&amp;C Red No. 40 powder, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake.<br/>
Meets USP Dissolution Test 3.</p><h2>Felodipine Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Felodipine is a member of the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel<br/>
antagonists (calcium channel blockers). It reversibly competes with nitrendipine<br/>
and/or other calcium channel blockers for dihydropyridine binding sites,<br/>
blocks voltage-dependent Ca++ currents in vascular smooth muscle and<br/>
cultured rabbit atrial cells, and blocks potassium-induced contracture of the<br/>
rat portal vein.<br/>
In vitro studies show that the effects of felodipine on contractile processes<br/>
are selective, with greater effects on vascular smooth muscle than cardiac<br/>
muscle. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro, but such effects<br/>
have not been seen in intact animals.<br/>
The effect of felodipine on blood pressure is principally a consequence of a<br/>
dose related decrease of peripheral vascular resistance in man, with a modest<br/>
reflex increase in heart rate (see Cardiovascular Effects). With the exception<br/>
of a mild diuretic effect seen in several animal species and man, the effects<br/>
of felodipine are accounted for by its effects on peripheral vascular resistance.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h3><p class="First">Following oral administration, felodipine is almost completely absorbed and<br/>
undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The systemic bioavailability of<br/>
felodipine extended-release tablets is approximately 20%. Mean peak<br/>
concentrations following the administration of felodipine extended-release<br/>
tablets are reached in 2.5 to 5 hours. Both peak plasma concentration and the<br/>
area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) increase linearly with<br/>
doses up to 20 mg. Felodipine is greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins.<br/>
Following intravenous administration, the plasma concentration of felodipine<br/>
declined triexponentially with mean disposition half-lives of 4.8 minutes,<br/>
1.5 hours, and 9.1 hours. The mean contributions of the three individual<br/>
phases to the overall AUC were 15%, 40% and 45%, respectively, in the order<br/>
of increasing t1/2.<br/>
Following oral administration of the immediate-release formulation, the plasma<br/>
level of felodipine also declined polyexponentially with a mean terminal t1/2 of<br/>
11 to 16 hours. The mean peak and trough steady-state plasma concentrations<br/>
achieved after 10 mg of the immediate-release formulation given once a day<br/>
to normal volunteers, were 20 and 0.5 nmol/L, respectively. The trough plasma<br/>
concentration of felodipine in most individuals was substantially below the<br/>
concentration needed to effect a half-maximal decline in blood pressure (EC50)<br/>
[4 to 6 nmol/L for felodipine], thus precluding once a day dosing with the<br/>
immediate-release formulation.<br/>
Following administration of a 10 mg dose of felodipine, the extended-release<br/>
formulation, to young, healthy volunteers, mean peak and trough steady-state<br/>
plasma concentrations of felodipine were 7 and 2 nmol/L, respectively.<br/>
Corresponding values in hypertensive patients (mean age 64) after a 20 mg<br/>
dose of felodipine extended-release tablets were 23 and 7 nmol/L. Since the<br/>
EC50 for felodipine is 4 to 6 nmol/L, a 5 mg to 10 mg dose of felodipine<br/>
extended-release tablets in some patients, and a 20 mg dose in others, would<br/>
be expected to provide an antihypertensive effect that persists for 24 hours<br/>
(see Cardiovascular Effects and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).<br/>
The systemic plasma clearance of felodipine in young healthy subjects is<br/>
about 0.8 L/min, and the apparent volume of distribution is about 10 L/kg.<br/>
Following an oral or intravenous dose of 14C-labeled felodipine in man, about<br/>
70% of the dose of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 10% in the feces.<br/>
A negligible amount of intact felodipine is recovered in the urine and feces<br/>
(&lt; 0.5%). Six metabolites, which account for 23% of the oral dose, have been<br/>
identified; none has significant vasodilating activity.<br/>
Following administration of felodipine extended-release tablets to hypertensive<br/>
patients, mean peak plasma concentrations at steady-state are about 20%<br/>
higher than after a single dose. Blood pressure response is correlated with<br/>
plasma concentrations of felodipine.<br/>
The bioavailability of felodipine extended-release tablets is influenced by the<br/>
presence of food. When administered either with a high fat or carbohydrate<br/>
diet, Cmax is increased by approximately 60%; AUC is unchanged. When<br/>
felodipine extended-release tablets were administered after a light meal<br/>
(orange juice, toast, and cereal), however, there is no effect on felodipine's<br/>
pharmacokinetics. The bioavailability of felodipine was increased approximately<br/>
2-fold when taken with grapefruit juice. Orange juice does not appear<br/>
to modify the kinetics of felodipine extended-release tablets. A similar finding<br/>
has been seen with other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, but to a lesser<br/>
extent than that seen with felodipine.</p><p class="First">Plasma concentrations of felodipine, after a single dose and at steady-state,<br/>
increase with age. Mean clearance of felodipine in elderly hypertensives<br/>
(mean age 74) was only 45% of that of young volunteers (mean age 26).<br/>
At steady-state mean AUC for young patients was 39% of that for the elderly.<br/>
Data for intermediate age ranges suggest that the AUCs fall between the<br/>
extremes of the young and the elderly.</p><p class="First">In patients with hepatic disease, the clearance of felodipine was reduced to<br/>
about 60% of that seen in normal young volunteers.<br/>
Renal impairment does not alter the plasma concentration profile of felodipine;<br/>
although higher concentrations of the metabolites are present in the plasma<br/>
due to decreased urinary excretion, these are inactive.<br/>
Animal studies have demonstrated that felodipine crosses the blood-brain<br/>
barrier and the placenta.</p><h3>Cardiovascular Effects</h3><p class="First">Following administration of felodipine extended-release tablets, a reduction<br/>
in blood pressure generally occurs within 2 to 5 hours. During chronic<br/>
administration, substantial blood pressure control lasts for 24 hours, with<br/>
trough reductions in diastolic blood pressure approximately 40% to 50% of<br/>
peak reductions. The antihypertensive effect is dose dependent and correlates<br/>
with the plasma concentration of felodipine.<br/>
A reflex increase in heart rate frequently occurs during the first week of<br/>
therapy; this increase attenuates over time. Heart rate increases of 5 to<br/>
10 beats per minute may be seen during chronic dosing. The increase is<br/>
inhibited by beta-blocking agents.<br/>
The P-R interval of the ECG is not affected by felodipine when administered<br/>
alone or in combination with a beta-blocking agent. Felodipine alone or in<br/>
combination with a beta-blocking agent has been shown, in clinical and<br/>
electrophysiologic studies, to have no significant effect on cardiac conduction<br/>
(P-R, P-Q, and H-V intervals).<br/>
In clinical trials in hypertensive patients without clinical evidence of left ventricular<br/>
dysfunction, no symptoms suggestive of a negative inotropic effect were<br/>
noted; however, none would be expected in this population (see PRECAUTIONS).</p><h3>Renal/Endocrine Effects</h3><p class="First">Renal vascular resistance is decreased by felodipine while glomerular filtration<br/>
rate remains unchanged. Mild diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis have been<br/>
observed during the first week of therapy. No significant effects on serum<br/>
electrolytes were observed during short- and long-term therapy.<br/>
In clinical trials in patients with hypertension, increases in plasma noradrenaline<br/>
levels have been observed.</p><h3>Clinical Studies</h3><p class="First">Felodipine produces dose related decreases in systolic and diastolic blood<br/>
pressure as demonstrated in six placebo-controlled, dose response studies<br/>
using either immediate-release or extended-release dosage forms. These<br/>
studies enrolled over 800 patients on active treatment, at total daily doses<br/>
ranging from 2.5 mg to 20 mg. In those studies felodipine was administered<br/>
either as monotherapy or was added to beta-blockers. The results of the two<br/>
studies with felodipine extended-release tablets given once daily as monotherapy<br/>
are shown in the table below:</p><p></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Felodipine Tablets</h2><p class="First">Felodipine extended-release tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of<br/>
hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the<br/>
risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial<br/>
infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of<br/>
antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including<br/>
felodipine.<br/>
Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular<br/>
risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management,<br/>
antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise and limited sodium intake.<br/>
Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure<br/>
goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines,<br/>
such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint<br/>
National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of<br/>
High Blood Pressure (JNC).<br/>
Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes<br/>
and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized<br/>
controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be<br/>
concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic<br/>
property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest<br/>
and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in<br/>
the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular<br/>
mortality also have been seen regularly.<br/>
Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk,<br/>
and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures,<br/>
so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial<br/>
benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across<br/>
populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in<br/>
patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example,<br/>
patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected<br/>
to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.<br/>
Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as<br/>
monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have<br/>
additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure or<br/>
diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.<br/>
Felodipine extended-release tablets, USP may be administered with other<br/>
antihypertensive agents.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Felodipine extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients who are<br/>
hypersensitive to this product.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Hypotension<br/>
Felodipine, like other calcium antagonists, may occasionally precipitate<br/>
significant hypotension and, rarely, syncope. It may lead to reflex tachycardia<br/>
which in susceptible individuals may precipitate angina pectoris. (See<br/>
ADVERSE REACTIONS.)<br/>
Heart Failure<br/>
Although acute hemodynamic studies in a small number of patients with<br/>
NYHA Class II or III heart failure treated with felodipine have not demonstrated<br/>
negative inotropic effects, safety in patients with heart failure has not<br/>
been established. Caution, therefore, should be exercised when using<br/>
ffelodipine extended-release tablets in patients with heart failure or compromised<br/>
ventricular function, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker.<br/>
Patients with Impaired Liver Function<br/>
Patients with impaired liver function may have elevated plasma concentrations<br/>
of felodipine and may respond to lower doses of felodipine extended-release<br/>
tablets; therefore, a starting dose of 2.5 mg once a day is recommended.<br/>
These patients should have their blood pressure monitored closely during<br/>
dosage adjustment of felodipine extended-release tablets. (See CLINICAL<br/>
PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)<br/>
Peripheral Edema<br/>
Peripheral edema, generally mild and not associated with generalized fluid<br/>
retention, was the most common adverse event in the clinical trials. The<br/>
incidence of peripheral edema was both dose and age dependent. Frequency<br/>
of peripheral edema ranged from about 10% in patients under 50 years of<br/>
age taking 5 mg daily to about 30% in those over 60 years of age taking 20<br/>
mg daily. This adverse effect generally occurs within 2 to 3 weeks of the<br/>
initiation of treatment.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients should be instructed to take felodipine extended-release tablets<br/>
whole and not to crush or chew the tablets. They should be told that mild<br/>
gingival hyperplasia (gum swelling) has been reported. Good dental hygiene<br/>
decreases its incidence and severity.<br/>
NOTE: As with many other drugs, certain advice to patients being treated<br/>
with felodipine extended-release tablets is warranted. This information is<br/>
intended to aid in the safe and effective use of this medication. It is not a<br/>
disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">CYP3A4 Inhibitors<br/>
Felodipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of CYP3A4 inhibitors<br/>
(e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, cimetidine)<br/>
with felodipine may lead to several-fold increases in the plasma levels of<br/>
felodipine, either due to an increase in bioavailability or due to a decrease in<br/>
metabolism. These increases in concentration may lead to increased effects,<br/>
(lower blood pressure and increased heart rate). These effects have been<br/>
observed with coadministration of itraconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor).<br/>
Caution should be used when CYP3A4 inhibitors are coadministered with<br/>
felodipine. A conservative approach to dosing felodipine should be taken. The<br/>
following specific interactions have been reported:<br/>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Itraconazole</span></span><br/>
Coadministration of another extended-release formulation of felodipine with<br/>
itraconazole resulted in approximately 8-fold increase in the AUC, more<br/>
than 6-fold increase in the Cmax, and 2-fold prolongation in the half-life of<br/>
felodipine.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Erythromycin</span></span><br/>
Coadministration of felodipine extended-release tablets with erythromycin<br/>
resulted in approximately 2.5-fold increase in the AUC and Cmax, and about<br/>
2-fold prolongation in the half-life of felodipine.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Grapefruit Juice</span></span><br/>
Coadministration of felodipine extended-release tablets with grapefruit<br/>
juice resulted in more than 2-fold increase in the AUC and Cmax, but no<br/>
prolongation in the half-life of felodipine.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Cimetidine</span></span><br/>
Coadministration of felodipine with cimetidine (a non-specific CYP-450 inhibitor)<br/>
resulted in an increase of approximately 50% in the AUC and the Cmax, of<br/>
felodipine.<br/>
Beta-Blocking Agents<br/>
A pharmacokinetic study of felodipine in conjunction with metoprolol demonstrated<br/>
no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of felodipine. The AUC and<br/>
Cmax of metoprolol, however, were increased approximately 31 and 38%,<br/>
respectively. In controlled clinical trials, however, beta-blockers including<br/>
metoprolol were concurrently administered with felodipine and were well<br/>
tolerated.<br/>
Digoxin<br/>
When given concomitantly with felodipine extended-release tablets the<br/>
pharmacokinetics of digoxin in patients with heart failure were not significantly<br/>
altered.<br/>
Anticonvulsants<br/>
In a pharmacokinetic study, maximum plasma concentrations of felodipine<br/>
were considerably lower in epileptic patients on long-term anticonvulsant<br/>
therapy (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital) than in healthy<br/>
volunteers. In such patients, the mean area under the felodipine plasma<br/>
concentration-time curve was also reduced to approximately 6% of that<br/>
observed in healthy volunteers. Since a clinically significant interaction may<br/>
be anticipated, alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in<br/>
these patients.<br/>
Tacrolimus<br/>
Felodipine may increase the blood concentration of tacrolimus. When given<br/>
concomitantly with felodipine, the tacrolimus blood concentration should be<br/>
followed and the tacrolimus dose may need to be adjusted.<br/>
Other Concomitant Therapy<br/>
In healthy subjects there were no clinically significant interactions when<br/>
felodipine was given concomitantly with indomethacin or spironolactone.<br/>
Interaction with Food<br/>
See <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</span>.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">In a 2 year carcinogenicity study in rats fed felodipine at doses of 7.7, 23.1<br/>
or 69.3 mg/kg/day (up to 61 times** the maximum recommended human dose<br/>
on a mg/m2 basis), a dose related increase in the incidence of benign<br/>
interstitial cell tumors of the testes (Leydig cell tumors) was observed in<br/>
treated male rats. These tumors were not observed in a similar study in mice<br/>
at doses up to 138.6 mg/kg/day (61 times** the maximum recommended<br/>
human dose on a mg/m2 basis). Felodipine, at the doses employed in the 2<br/>
year rat study, has been shown to lower testicular testosterone and to produce<br/>
a corresponding increase in serum luteinizing hormone in rats. The Leydig<br/>
cell tumor development is possibly secondary to these hormonal effects<br/>
which have not been observed in man.<br/>
In this same rat study a dose related increase in the incidence of focal<br/>
squamous cell hyperplasia compared to control was observed in the esophageal<br/>
groove of male and female rats in all dose groups. No other drug-related<br/>
esophageal or gastric pathology was observed in the rats or with chronic<br/>
administration in mice and dogs. The latter species, like man, has no anatomical<br/>
structure comparable to the esophageal groove.<br/>
Felodipine was not carcinogenic when fed to mice at doses up to 138.6 mg/kg/day<br/>
(61 times** the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis) for<br/>
periods of up to 80 weeks in males and 99 weeks in females.<br/>
Felodipine did not display any mutagenic activity in vitro in the Ames<br/>
microbial mutagenicity test or in the mouse lymphoma forward mutation<br/>
assay. No clastogenic potential was seen in vivo in the mouse micronucleus<br/>
test at oral doses up to 2500 mg/kg (1,100 times** the maximum recommended<br/>
human dose on a mg/m2 basis) or in vitro in a human lymphocyte chromosome<br/>
aberration assay.<br/>
A fertility study in which male and female rats were administered doses of<br/>
3.8, 9.6 or 26.9 mg/kg/day (up to 24 times** the maximum recommended<br/>
human dose on a mg/m2 basis) showed no significant effect of felodipine on<br/>
reproductive performance.<br/>
**Based on patient weight of 50 kg</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C<br/>
Studies in pregnant rabbits administered doses of 0.46, 1.2, 2.3 and 4.6 mg/kg/day<br/>
(from 0.8 to 8 times** the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2<br/>
basis) showed digital anomalies consisting of reduction in size and degree<br/>
of ossification of the terminal phalanges in the fetuses. The frequency and<br/>
severity of the changes appeared dose related and were noted even at the<br/>
lowest dose. These changes have been shown to occur with other members<br/>
of the dihydropyridine class and are possibly a result of compromised uterine<br/>
blood flow. Similar fetal anomalies were not observed in rats given felodipine.<br/>
In a teratology study in cynomolgus monkeys, no reduction in the size of the<br/>
terminal phalanges was observed, but an abnormal position of the distal<br/>
phalanges was noted in about 40% of the fetuses.<br/>
Nonteratogenic Effects<br/>
A prolongation of parturition with difficult labor and an increased frequency<br/>
of fetal and early postnatal deaths were observed in rats administered doses<br/>
of 9.6 mg/kg/day (8 times** the maximum human dose on a mg/m2 basis) and<br/>
above.<br/>
**Based on patient weight of 50 kg<br/>
Significant enlargement of the mammary glands, in excess of the normal<br/>
enlargement for pregnant rabbits, was found with doses greater than or equal<br/>
to 1.2 mg/kg/day (2.1 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m2 basis).<br/>
This effect occurred only in pregnant rabbits and regressed during lactation.<br/>
Similar changes in the mammary glands were not observed in rats or<br/>
monkeys.<br/>
There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If<br/>
felodipine extended-release tablet is used during pregnancy, or if the<br/>
patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, she should be apprised<br/>
of the potential hazard to the fetus, possible digital anomalies of the infant,<br/>
and the potential effects of felodipine on labor and delivery and on the<br/>
mammary glands of pregnant females.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk and because of<br/>
the potential for serious adverse reactions from felodipine in the infant, a<br/>
decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue<br/>
the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of felodipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects<br/>
aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger<br/>
subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in<br/>
responses between the elderly and younger patients. Pharmacokinetics,<br/>
however, indicate that the availability of felodipine is increased in older<br/>
patients (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric Use</span>). In general, dose<br/>
selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low<br/>
end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased<br/>
hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug<br/>
therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">In controlled studies in the United States and overseas, approximately 3,000<br/>
patients were treated with felodipine as either the extended-release or the<br/>
immediate-release formulation.<br/>
The most common clinical adverse events reported with felodipine extendedrelease<br/>
tablets administered as monotherapy at the recommended dosage<br/>
range of 2.5 mg to 10 mg once a day were peripheral edema and headache.<br/>
Peripheral edema was generally mild, but it was age and dose related and<br/>
resulted in discontinuation of therapy in about 3% of the enrolled patients.<br/>
Discontinuation of therapy due to any clinical adverse event occurred in<br/>
about 6% of the patients receiving felodipine extended-release tablets,</p><p>principally for peripheral edema, headache, or flushing.<br/>
Adverse events that occurred with an incidence of 1.5% or greater at any of<br/>
the recommended doses of 2.5 mg to 10 mg once a day (felodipine extendedrelease<br/>
tablets, N = 861; Placebo, N = 334), without regard to causality, are<br/>
compared to placebo and are listed by dose in the table below. These events are<br/>
reported from controlled clinical trials with patients who were randomized to<br/>
a fixed dose of felodipine extended-release tablets or titrated from an initial<br/>
dose of 2.5 mg or 5 mg once a day. A dose of 20 mg once a day has been<br/>
evaluated in some clinical studies. Although the antihypertensive effect of<br/>
felodipine extended-release tablets is increased at 20 mg once a day,<br/>
there is a disproportionate increase in adverse events, especially those<br/>
associated with vasodilatory effects (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p></p><p>Adverse events that occurred in 0.5% up to 1.5% of patients who received<br/>
felodipine extended-release tablets in all controlled clinical trials at the<br/>
recommended dosage range of 2.5 mg to 10 mg once a day, and serious<br/>
adverse events that occurred at a lower rate, or events reported during<br/>
marketing experience (those lower rate events are in italics) are listed<br/>
below. These events are listed in order of decreasing severity within each<br/>
category, and the relationship of these events to administration of felodipine<br/>
extended-release tablets is uncertain:<br/>

Clinical Laboratory Test Findings<br/>
Serum Electrolytes<br/>
No significant effects on serum electrolytes were observed during short- and<br/>
long-term therapy (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Renal/Endocrine</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Effects</span>).<br/>
Serum Glucose<br/>
No significant effects on fasting serum glucose were observed in patients<br/>
treated with felodipine extended-release tablets in the U.S. controlled study.<br/>
Liver Enzymes<br/>
One of two episodes of elevated serum transaminases decreased once drug<br/>
was discontinued in clinical studies; no follow-up was available for the other<br/>
patient.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Oral doses of 240 mg/kg and 264 mg/kg in male and female mice, respectively,<br/>
and 2390 mg/kg and 2250 mg/kg in male and female rats, respectively,<br/>
caused significant lethality.<br/>
In a suicide attempt, one patient took 150 mg felodipine together with 15 tablets<br/>
each of atenolol and spironolactone and 20 tablets of nitrazepam. The patient's<br/>
blood pressure and heart rate were normal on admission to hospital; he<br/>
subsequently recovered without significant sequelae.<br/>
Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation<br/>
with marked hypotension and possibly bradycardia.<br/>
If severe hypotension occurs, symptomatic treatment should be instituted.<br/>
The patient should be placed supine with the legs elevated. The administration<br/>
of intravenous fluids may be useful to treat hypotension due to overdosage<br/>
with calcium antagonists. In case of accompanying bradycardia, atropine<br/>
(0.5 mg to 1 mg) should be administered intravenously. Sympathomimetic<br/>
drugs may also be given if the physician feels they are warranted.<br/>
It has not been established whether felodipine can be removed from the<br/>
circulation by hemodialysis.<br/>
To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, consult<br/>
your Regional Poison-Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poisoncontrol<br/>
centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR). In managing<br/>
overdose, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug overdoses, drug-drug<br/>
interactions, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.</p><h2>Felodipine Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The recommended starting dose is 5 mg once a day. Depending on the patient's<br/>
response, the dosage can be decreased to 2.5 mg or increased to 10 mg<br/>
once a day. These adjustments should occur generally at intervals of not less<br/>
than 2 weeks. The recommended dosage range is 2.5 mg to 10 mg once<br/>
daily. In clinical trials, doses above 10 mg daily showed an increased blood<br/>
pressure response but a large increase in the rate of peripheral edema and<br/>
other vasodilatory adverse events (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>). Modification<br/>
of the recommended dosage is usually not required in patients with renal<br/>
impairment.<br/>
Felodipine extended-release tablets should regularly be taken either without<br/>
food or with a light meal (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">and Metabolism</span>). Felodipine extended-release tablets should be swallowed<br/>
whole and not crushed or chewed.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Patients over 65 years of age are likely to develop higher plasma concentrations<br/>
of felodipine (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>). In general, dose selection<br/>
for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the<br/>
dosing range (2.5 mg daily). Elderly patients should have their blood pressure<br/>
closely monitored during any dosage adjustment.</p><h3>Patients with Impaired Liver Function</h3><p class="First">Patients with impaired liver function may have elevated plasma concentrations<br/>
of felodipine and may respond to lower doses of felodipine extended-release<br/>
tablets; therefore, patients should have their blood pressure monitored closely<br/>
during dosage adjustment of felodipine extended-release tablets (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">PHARMACOLOGY</span>).</p><h2>How is Felodipine Tablets Supplied</h2><p class="First">Felodipine Extended-release Tablets, USP are available containing 2.5 mg,<br/>
