Patients who are opioid-experienced are those receiving, for one week or longer, daily opioid doses up to 80 mg/day of oral morphine or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.</p><p>• Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient's treatment goals <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5)].</span></p><p>• Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>• Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with buprenorphine transdermal system <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><p>• Instruct patients not to use buprenorphine transdermal system if the pouch seal is broken or the patch is cut, damaged, or changed in any way and not to cut buprenorphine transdermal system.</p><p>• Instruct patients to avoid exposing buprenorphine transdermal system to external heat sources, hot water, or prolonged direct sunlight <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)]</span>.</p><p>Buprenorphine transdermal system is for transdermal use (on intact skin) only. Each buprenorphine transdermal system patch is intended to be worn for 7 days.</p><h3>Initial Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Use of Buprenorphine Transdermal System as the First Opioid Analgesic</span> (opioid-naive patients)</p><p>Initiate treatment with buprenorphine transdermal system with a 5 mcg/hour patch.</p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from Other Opioids to  Buprenorphine Transdermal System</span></p><p>Discontinue all other around-the-clock opioid drugs when buprenorphine transdermal system therapy is initiated.</p><p>There is a potential for buprenorphine to precipitate withdrawal in patients who are already on opioids.</p><p><span class="Italics">Prior Total Daily Dose of Opioid Less than 30 mg of Oral Morphine Equivalents per Day</span>:</p><p>Initiate treatment with buprenorphine transdermal system 5 mcg/hour at the next dosing interval (see Table 1 below, middle column).</p><p><span class="Italics">Prior Total Daily Dose of Opioid Between 30 mg to 80 mg of Oral Morphine Equivalents per</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Day:</span></p><p>Taper the patient’s current around-the-clock opioids for up to 7 days to no more than 30 mg of morphine or equivalent per day before beginning treatment with buprenorphine transdermal system. Then initiate treatment with buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour at the next dosing interval (see Table 1 below, right column).

The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma.</p><h3>Titration and Maintenance of Therapy</h3><p class="First">Individually titrate buprenorphine transdermal system to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving buprenorphine transdermal system to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for opioid analgesics.</p><p>The minimum buprenorphine transdermal system titration interval is 72 hours, based on the pharmacokinetic profile and time to reach steady-state levels <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>The maximum buprenorphine transdermal system dose is 20 mcg/hour. Do not exceed a dose of one 20 mcg/hour buprenorphine transdermal system due to the risk of QTc interval prolongation. In a clinical trial, buprenorphine transdermal system 40 mcg/hour (given as two buprenorphine transdermal system 20 mcg/hour systems) resulted in prolongation of the QTc interval <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><p>Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment increase of buprenorphine transdermal system, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the buprenorphine transdermal system dose.</p><p>Because steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved within 72 hours, buprenorphine transdermal system dosage may be adjusted every 3 days. Dose adjustments may be made in 5 mcg/hour, 7.5 mcg/hour, or 10 mcg/hour increments by using no more than two patches of the 5 mcg/hour, or 7.5 mcg/hour, or 10 mcg/hour system(s). The total dose from both patches should not exceed 20 mcg/hour. For the use of two patches, instruct patients to remove their current patch, and apply the two new patches at the same time, adjacent to one another at a different application site <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].</span></p><p>If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between the management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.</p><h3>Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Buprenorphine Transdermal System</h3><p class="First">Do not abruptly discontinue buprenorphine transdermal system in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.</p><p>When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking buprenorphine transdermal system, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of buprenorphine transdermal system the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.</p><p>There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on buprenorphine transdermal system who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.</p><p>It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.</p><p>When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine transdermal system has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. As buprenorphine transdermal system is only intended for 7-day application, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing in patients with severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11), Use in Specific Populations (8.6),</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Administration of Buprenorphine Transdermal System</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Instruct patients to apply immediately after removal from the individually sealed pouch. Instruct patients not to use buprenorphine transdermal system if the pouch seal is broken or the patch is cut, damaged, or changed in any way. See the Instructions for Use for step-by-step instructions for applying buprenorphine transdermal system.</li>
<li>Apply buprenorphine transdermal system to the upper outer arm, upper chest, upper back or the side of the chest. These 4 sites (each present on both sides of the body) provide 8 possible application sites. Rotate buprenorphine transdermal system among the 8 described skin sites. After buprenorphine transdermal system removal, wait a minimum of 21 days before reapplying to the same skin site <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></li>
<li>Apply buprenorphine transdermal system to a hairless or nearly hairless skin site. If none are available, the hair at the site should be clipped, not shaven. Do not apply buprenorphine transdermal system to irritated skin. If the application site must be cleaned, clean the site with water only. Do not use soaps, alcohol, oils, lotions, or abrasive devices. Allow the skin to dry before applying buprenorphine transdermal system.</li>
<li>Incidental exposure of the buprenorphine transdermal system patch to water, such as while bathing or showering is acceptable based on experience during clinical studies.</li>
<li>If problems with adhesion of buprenorphine transdermal system occur, the edges may be taped with first aid tape. If problems with lack of adhesion continue, the patch may be covered with waterproof or semipermeable adhesive dressings suitable for 7 days of wear.</li>
<li>If buprenorphine transdermal system falls off during the 7-day dosing interval, dispose of the transdermal system properly and place a new buprenorphine transdermal system patch on at a different skin site.</li>
<li>When changing the system, instruct patients to remove buprenorphine transdermal system and dispose of it properly <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].</span></li>
<li>If the buprenorphine-containing adhesive matrix accidentally contacts the skin, instruct patients or caregivers to wash the area with water and not to use soap, alcohol, or other solvents to remove the adhesive because they may enhance the absorption of the drug.</li>
</ul><h3>Disposal Instructions</h3><p class="First">Patients should refer to the Instructions for Use for proper disposal of buprenorphine transdermal system. Dispose of used and unused patches by following the instructions on the Patch-Disposal Unit that is packaged with the buprenorphine transdermal system patches.</p><p>Alternatively, patients can dispose of used patches by folding the adhesive side of the patch to itself, then flushing the patch down the toilet immediately upon removal. Unused patches should be removed from their pouches, the protective liners removed, the patches folded so that the adhesive side of the patch adheres to itself, and immediately flushed down the toilet.</p><p>Patients should dispose of any patches remaining from a prescription as soon as they are no longer needed.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Buprenorphine transdermal system is a rectangular or square, beige-colored system consisting of a protective liner and functional layers. Buprenorphine transdermal system is available in five strengths:</p><ul class="Square">
<li>Buprenorphine transdermal system 5 mcg/hour Transdermal System (dimensions: 46 mm by 46 mm)</li>
<li>Buprenorphine transdermal system 7.5 mcg/hour Transdermal System (dimensions: 57 mm by 46 mm)</li>
<li>Buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour Transdermal System (dimensions: 46 mm by 70 mm)</li>
<li>Buprenorphine transdermal system 15 mcg/hour Transdermal System (dimensions: 58 mm by 70 mm)</li>
<li>Buprenorphine transdermal system 20 mcg/hour Transdermal System (dimensions: 71 mm by 71 mm)</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Buprenorphine transdermal system is contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul class="Square">
<li>Significant respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]<br/></span></li>
<li>Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span></li>
<li>Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)]</span></li>
<li>Hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to buprenorphine <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)</span> and <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6)]</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine transdermal system contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance. As an opioid, buprenorphine transdermal system exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]</span>. Because extended-release products such as buprenorphine transdermal system deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death, due to the larger amount of buprenorphine present.</p><p>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed buprenorphine transdermal system. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused.</p><p>Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing buprenorphine transdermal system, and monitor all patients receiving buprenorphine transdermal system for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as buprenorphine transdermal system, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of buprenorphine transdermal system, along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, or misuse.</p><p>Abuse or misuse of buprenorphine transdermal system by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose and death <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine transdermal system. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><h3>Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)</h3><p class="First">To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:</p><p>• Complete a <span class="Bold">REMS-compliant education program</span> offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.</p><p>• Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link:</p><p>www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG.</p><p>• Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them.</p><p>• Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities.</p><p>To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com. The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint.</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>. Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of buprenorphine transdermal system, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of buprenorphine transdermal system.</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of buprenorphine transdermal system are essential <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>. Overestimating the buprenorphine transdermal system dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.</p><p>Accidental exposure to buprenorphine transdermal system, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of buprenorphine.</p><p>Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Prolonged use of buprenorphine transdermal system during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First">Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of buprenorphine transdermal system with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when buprenorphine transdermal system is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</h3><p class="First">The use of buprenorphine transdermal system in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease</span>: Buprenorphine transdermal system-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of buprenorphine transdermal system <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</span>: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><p>Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating buprenorphine transdermal system and when buprenorphine transdermal system is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.5)]</span>. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.</p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><h3>QTc Prolongation</h3><p class="First">A positive-controlled study of the effects of buprenorphine transdermal system on the QTc interval in healthy subjects demonstrated no clinically meaningful effect at a buprenorphine transdermal system dose of 10 mcg/hour; however, a buprenorphine transdermal system dose of 40 mcg/hour (given as two  20 mcg/hour buprenorphine transdermal systems) was observed to prolong the QTc interval.</p><p>Consider these observations in clinical decisions when prescribing buprenorphine transdermal system to patients with hypokalemia or clinically unstable cardiac disease, including unstable atrial fibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, or active myocardial ischemia. Avoid the use of buprenorphine transdermal system in patients with a history of Long QT Syndrome or an immediate family member with this condition, or those taking Class IA antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) or Class III antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., sotalol, amiodarone, dofetilide), or other medications that prolong the QTc interval <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>, <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine transdermal system may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of buprenorphine transdermal system. In patients with circulatory shock, buprenorphine transdermal system may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of buprenorphine transdermal system in patients with circulatory shock.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury or Impaired Consciousness</h3><p class="First">In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), buprenorphine transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with buprenorphine transdermal system.</p><p>Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of buprenorphine transdermal system in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving sublingual buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence, both in clinical trials and in post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injection drug</p><p>abuse may have played a causative or contributory role. For patients at increased risk of hepatotoxicity (e.g., patients with a history of excessive alcohol intake, intravenous drug abuse or liver disease), obtain baseline liver enzyme levels and monitor periodically and during treatment with buprenorphine transdermal system.</p><h3>Application Site Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">In rare cases, severe application site skin reactions with signs of marked inflammation including “burn,” “discharge,” and “vesicles” have occurred. Time of onset varies, ranging from days to months following the initiation of buprenorphine transdermal system treatment. Instruct patients to promptly report the development of severe application site reactions and discontinue therapy.</p><h3>Anaphylactic/Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Cases of acute and chronic hypersensitivity to buprenorphine have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine is a contraindication to the use of buprenorphine transdermal system.</p><h3>Withdrawal</h3><p class="First">Do not abruptly discontinue buprenorphine in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing buprenorphine transdermal system in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of buprenorphine in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</p><p>Additionally, the use of buprenorphine transdermal system, a partial agonist opioid analgesic, in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid concomitant use of buprenorphine transdermal system with a full opioid agonist analgesic.</p><h3>Risks of Use with Application of External Heat</h3><p class="First">Advise patients and their caregivers to avoid exposing the buprenorphine transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources, such as heating pads or electric blankets, heat or tanning lamps, saunas, hot tubs, and heated water beds while wearing the system because an increase in absorption of buprenorphine may occur <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Advise patients against exposure of the buprenorphine transdermal system application site and surrounding area to hot water or prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. There is a potential for temperature-dependent increases in buprenorphine released from the system resulting in possible overdose and death <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Fever</h3><p class="First">Monitor patients wearing buprenorphine transdermal systems who develop fever or increased core body temperature due to strenuous exertion for opioid side effects and adjust the buprenorphine transdermal system dose if signs of respiratory or central nervous system depression occur.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine transdermal system is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>The buprenorphine in buprenorphine transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</h3><p class="First">The buprenorphine in buprenorphine transdermal system may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during buprenorphine transdermal system therapy.</p><h3>Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine transdermal system may impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or</p><p>operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of buprenorphine transdermal system and know how they will react to the medication <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Use in Addiction Treatment</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine transdermal system has not been studied and is not approved for use in the management of addictive disorders.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><p>• Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></p><p>• Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></p><p>• Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></p><p>• Interactions with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span></p><p>• Adrenal Insufficiency <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span></p><p>• QTc Prolongation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span></p><p>• Severe Hypotension <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]</span></p><p>• Hepatotoxicity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]</span></p><p>• Application Site Skin Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]</span></p><p>• Anaphylactic/Allergic Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]</span></p><p>• Gastrointestinal Effects <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.17)]</span></p><p>• Seizures <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.18)]</span></p><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>A total of 5,415 patients were treated with buprenorphine transdermal system in controlled and open-label chronic pain clinical trials.

Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn.

An opioid antagonist such as naloxone must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Buprenorphine transdermal system is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when shorter acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including buprenorphine transdermal system, can prolong labor through actions that temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Studies in rats and rabbits demonstrated no evidence of teratogenicity following buprenorphine transdermal system  or subcutaneous (SC) administration of buprenorphine during the period of organogenesis.

Rabbits were administered four buprenorphine transdermal systems 20 mcg/hour every 3 days (Gestation Days 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 19) or received daily SC buprenorphine up to 5 mg/kg (Gestation Days 6 to 19). No teratogenicity was observed at any dose. AUC values for buprenorphine with buprenorphine transdermal system application and SC injection were approximately 110 and 140 times, respectively, that of human subjects who received the MRHD of one buprenorphine transdermal system 20 mcg/hour.</p><p>In a pre- and post-natal study conducted in pregnant and lactating rats, administration of buprenorphine either as buprenorphine transdermal system or SC buprenorphine was associated with toxicity to offspring.

However, due to Purdue Pharma L.P.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in the clinical trials (5,415), buprenorphine transdermal system was administered to 1,377 patients aged 65 years and older. Of those, 457 patients were 75 years of age and older. In the clinical program, the incidences of selected buprenorphine transdermal system-related AEs were higher in older subjects. The incidences of application site AEs were slightly higher among subjects &lt; 65 years of age than those ≥ 65 years of age for both buprenorphine transdermal system and placebo treatment groups.</p><p>In a single-dose study of healthy elderly and healthy young subjects treated with buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour, the pharmacokinetics were similar. In a separate dose-escalation safety study, the pharmacokinetics in the healthy elderly and hypertensive elderly subjects taking thiazide diuretics were similar to those in the healthy young adults. In the elderly groups evaluated, adverse event rates were similar to or lower than rates in healthy young adult subjects, except for constipation and urinary retention, which were more common in the elderly. Although specific dose adjustments on the basis of advanced age are not required for pharmacokinetic reasons, use caution in the elderly population to ensure safe use <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of buprenorphine transdermal system slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In a study utilizing intravenous buprenorphine, peak plasma levels (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and exposure (AUC) of buprenorphine in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment did not increase as compared to those observed in subjects with normal hepatic function. Buprenorphine transdermal system has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. As buprenorphine transdermal system is intended for 7-day dosing, consider the use of alternate analgesic therapy in patients with severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) </span>and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine transdermal system contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine transdermal system contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance with an abuse potential similar to other Schedule III opioids. Buprenorphine transdermal system can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction and criminal diversion <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. The high drug content in extended-release formulations adds to the risk of adverse outcomes from abuse and misuse.</p><p>All patients treated with opioids, including buprenorphine transdermal system, require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p><p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</p><p>“Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare providers(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>Buprenorphine transdermal system, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Risks Specific to the Abuse of Buprenorphine Transdermal System</span></span></p><p>Buprenorphine transdermal system is intended for transdermal use only. Abuse of buprenorphine transdermal system poses a risk of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of buprenorphine transdermal system with alcohol and other substances including other opioids and benzodiazepines <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span> and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Intentional compromise of the transdermal delivery system will result in the uncontrolled delivery of buprenorphine and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span> Abuse may occur by applying the transdermal system in the absence of legitimate purpose, or by chewing, swallowing, snorting, or injecting buprenorphine extracted from the transdermal system. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p><p>Physical dependence is a physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after a period of regular exposure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), or mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</p><p>Do not abruptly discontinue buprenorphine transdermal system in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of buprenorphine transdermal system in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing buprenorphine transdermal system, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of buprenorphine transdermal system the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]</span>.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span></p><p>Acute overdosage with buprenorphine transdermal system is manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment of Overdose</span></p><p>In case of overdose, priorities are the re-establishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen, vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life support techniques.</p><p>Naloxone may not be effective in reversing any respiratory depression produced by buprenorphine. High doses of naloxone, 10 to 35 mg/70 kg, may be of limited value in the management of buprenorphine overdose. The onset of naloxone effect may be delayed by 30 minutes or more. Doxapram hydrochloride (a respiratory stimulant) has also been used.</p><p>Remove buprenorphine transdermal system immediately. Because the duration of reversal would be expected to be less than the duration of action of buprenorphine from buprenorphine transdermal system, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. Even in the face of improvement, continued medical monitoring is required because of the possibility of extended effects as buprenorphine continues to be absorbed from the skin. After removal of buprenorphine transdermal system, the mean buprenorphine concentrations decrease approximately 50% in 12 hours (range 10 to 24 hours) with an apparent terminal half-life of approximately 26 hours. Due to this long apparent terminal half-life, patients may require monitoring and treatment for at least 24 hours.</p><p>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of an opioid receptor antagonist may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p><h2>Buprenorphine Patch Description</h2><p class="First">Buprenorphine transdermal system is a transdermal system providing systemic delivery of buprenorphine, a mu opioid partial agonist analgesic, continuously for 7 days. The chemical name of buprenorphine is 6,14- ethenomorphinan-7-methanol, 17-(cyclopropylmethyl)- α-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4, 5-epoxy-18, 19-dihydro-3-hydroxy-6-methoxy-α-methyl-, [5α, 7α, (S)].

Buprenorphine occurs as a white or almost white powder and is very slightly soluble in water, freely soluble in acetone, soluble in methanol and ether, and slightly soluble in cyclohexane. The pKa is 8.5 and the melting point is about 217°C.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">System Components and Structure</span></span></p><p>Five different strengths of buprenorphine transdermal system are available: 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20 mcg/hour (Table 6). The proportion of buprenorphine mixed in the adhesive matrix is the same in each of the five strengths. The amount of buprenorphine released from each system per hour is proportional to the active surface area of the system.

The inactive ingredients in each system are: acrylic adhesive, levulinic acid, oleyl oleate, and povidone.</p><h2>Buprenorphine Patch - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptors, an agonist at delta-opioid receptors, and a partial agonist at ORL-1 (nociceptin) receptors. The contributions of these actions to its analgesic profile are unclear.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on the Central Nervous System</span></p><p>Buprenorphine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brainstem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brainstem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.</p><p>Buprenorphine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with worsening hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span></p><p>Buprenorphine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span></p><p>Buprenorphine produces peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>The effect of buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour and 2 x buprenorphine transdermal system 20 mcg/hour on QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind (buprenorphine transdermal system vs. placebo), randomized, placebo and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg, open label), parallel-group, dose-escalating, single-dose study in 132 healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 55 years. The dose escalation sequence for buprenorphine transdermal system during the titration period was: buprenorphine transdermal system 5 mcg/hour for 3 days, then buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour for 3 days, then buprenorphine transdermal system 20 mcg/hour for 3 days, then 2 x buprenorphine transdermal system 20 mcg/hour for 4 days. The QTc evaluation was performed during the third day of buprenorphine transdermal system 10 mcg/hour and the fourth day of 2 x buprenorphine transdermal system 20 mcg/hour when the plasma levels of buprenorphine were at steady-state for the corresponding doses <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span>.</p><p>There was no clinically meaningful effect on mean QTc with a buprenorphine transdermal system dose of 10 mcg/hour. A buprenorphine transdermal system dose of 40 mcg/hour (given as two 20 mcg/hour buprenorphine  transdermal systems) prolonged mean QTc by a maximum of 9.2 (90% CI: 5.2 to 13.3) msec across the 13 assessment time points.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Endocrine System</span></p><p>Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Immune System</span></p><p>Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and animal models.

Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) do not appear to have clinically significant interactions with buprenorphine. However, certain protease inhibitors (PIs) with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity such as atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir resulted in elevated levels of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine when buprenorphine and naloxone were administered sublingually.
