In this case, the radioactive agent builds up in the cancerous area and destroys the affected tissue. This radiopharmaceutical may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.</p><p>Sodium phosphate P 32 is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor with specialized training in nuclear medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using sodium phosphate p 32</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

The amount of radioactivity of a radiopharmaceutical is expressed in units called becquerels or curies. Usual adult doses of sodium phosphate P 32 range from 37 megabecquerels (1 millicurie) to 185 megabecquerels (5 millicuries). The dose you receive depends on your size, age, and blood test measurements (blood counts).
