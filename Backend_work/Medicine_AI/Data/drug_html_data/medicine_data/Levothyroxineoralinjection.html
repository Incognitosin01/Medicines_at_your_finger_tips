Levothyroxine is given when your thyroid does not produce enough of this hormone on its own.</p><p>Levothyroxine is also used to treat or prevent goiter (enlarged thyroid gland), which can be caused by hormone imbalances, radiation treatment, surgery, or cancer.</p><p>There are many brands and forms of levothyroxine available. Not all brands are listed on this leaflet.</p><p>Levothyroxine may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You may not be able to take levothyroxine if you have certain medical conditions. Tell your doctor if you have an untreated or uncontrolled adrenal gland disorder, a thyroid disorder called thyrotoxicosis, or if you have any recent or current symptoms of a heart attack.</p><p><b>Levothyroxine should not be used to treat obesity or weight problems.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p><b>Levothyroxine should not be used to treat obesity or weight problems.</b> Dangerous side effects or death can occur from the misuse of levothyroxine, especially if you are taking any other weight-loss medications or appetite suppressants.</p><p>Since thyroid hormone occurs naturally in the body, almost anyone can take levothyroxine. However, you may not be able to take  levothyroxine if you have certain medical conditions. Tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>an untreated or uncontrolled adrenal gland disorder;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a thyroid disorder called thyrotoxicosis; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>symptoms of a heart attack (chest pain or heavy feeling, pain spreading to the jaw or shoulder, nausea, sweating, general ill feeling).</p>

Having low thyroid hormone levels during pregnancy could harm both mother and baby. <b>Your dose needs may be different during pregnancy.</b></p><p>Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. <b>Your dose needs may be different while you are nursing.</b></p><p>Do not give this medicine to a child without medical advice. <b>Tirosint</b> is not approved for use by anyone younger than 6 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take levothyroxine?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Levothyroxine oral is taken by mouth. Levothyroxine injection is given as an infusion into a vein. Levothyroxine is usually given by injection only if you are unable to take the medicine by mouth.</p><p>Levothyroxine <b>oral</b> works best if you take it on an empty stomach, 30 to 60 minutes before breakfast. Follow your doctor's dosing instructions and try to take the medicine at the same time each day.</p><p>Swallow the <b>tablet</b> or <b>capsule</b> whole, with a full glass (8 ounces) of water. The levothyroxine tablet may dissolve very quickly and could swell in your throat.</p><p>Measure liquid medicine carefully. Use the dosing syringe provided, or use a medicine dose-measuring device (not a kitchen spoon).</p><p>Levothyroxine doses are based on weight in children. Your child's dose needs may change if the child gains or loses weight.</p><p>It may take several weeks before your body starts to respond to levothyroxine. <b>Keep using this medicine even if you feel well.</b> You may need to use levothyroxine for the rest of your life.</p><p>You may need frequent medical tests. Tell any doctor, dentist, or surgeon who treats you that you are using levothyroxine.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>Do not share this medicine with another person, even if they have the same symptoms you have.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>Overdose symptoms may include headache, leg cramps, tremors, feeling nervous or irritable, chest pain, shortness of breath, and fast or pounding heartbeats.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking levothyroxine?</h2><p>Avoid the following food products, which can make your body absorb less levothyroxine: grapefruit juice, infant soy formula, soybean flour, cotton seed meal, walnuts, and high-fiber foods.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Levothyroxine side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction</b>: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
