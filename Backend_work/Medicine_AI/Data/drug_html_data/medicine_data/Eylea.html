It works by keeping new blood vessels from forming under the retina (a sensory membrane that lines the inside of the eye). In people with a certain type of eye disease, new blood vessels grow under the retina where they leak blood and fluid. This is known as the "wet form" of macular degeneration.</p><p>Eylea is used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration. It is also used to treat swelling in the retina caused by a blockage in the blood vessels.</p><p>Eylea is also used to treat diabetic retinopathy, an eye disorder in diabetics that can lead to a buildup of fluid in the retina and cause blindness.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Eylea if you are allergic to aflibercept, or if you have swelling inside your eyes, or any type of infection (bacterial, fungal, viral) in or around your eyes.
