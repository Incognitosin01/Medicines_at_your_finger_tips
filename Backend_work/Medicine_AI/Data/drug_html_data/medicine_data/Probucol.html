This may help prevent medical problems caused by cholesterol clogging the blood vessels.</p><p>Probucol was available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><p>Probucol was voluntarily removed from the market in the United States during 1995. The withdrawal from the market was due to safety concerns .</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using probucol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For probucol, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to probucol or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>There is no specific information about the use of probucol in children. However, use is not recommended in children under 2 years of age since cholesterol is needed for normal development.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of probucol in the elderly with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

</ul><p>Using probucol with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>
<li>Cyclosporine</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of probucol. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Gallbladder disease or gallstones or</li>
<li>Heart disease—Probucol may make these conditions worse.</li>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of probucol</h2><p>Many patients who have high cholesterol levels will not notice any signs of the problem. In fact, many may feel normal. Take probucol exactly as directed by your doctor, even though you may feel well. Try not to miss any doses and do not take more medicine than your doctor ordered.</p><p>Remember that probucol will not cure your condition but it does help control it. Therefore, you must continue to take it as directed if you expect to keep your cholesterol levels down.</p><p>Follow carefully the special diet your doctor gave you. This is the most important part of controlling your condition, and is necessary if the medicine is to work properly.</p><p>Probucol works better when taken with meals.</p><p>Before prescribing medicine for your condition, your doctor will probably try to control your condition by prescribing a personal diet for you. Such a diet may be low in fats, sugars, and/or cholesterol. Many people are able to control their condition by carefully following their doctor's orders for proper diet and exercise. Medicine is prescribed only when additional help is needed and is effective only when a schedule of diet and exercise is properly followed.</p><p>Also, probucol is less effective if you are greatly overweight. It may be very important for you to go on a reducing diet. However, check with your doctor before going on any diet.</p><p>Make certain your health care professional knows if you are on a low-sodium, low-sugar, or any other special diet.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of probucol will be different for different patients.
