<li>Patients with narrow angle glaucoma, urinary retention, severe hypertension, or severe coronary artery disease.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of opioids, including hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution, with benzodiazepines, or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, avoid use of opioid cough medications in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions ( 7.1)]</span> . Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. Because of similar pharmacologic properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with concomitant use of opioid cough medications and benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation if hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution is used with benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other CNS depressants <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information ( 17.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone bitartrate, one of the active ingredients in hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution, produces dose-related respiratory depression by directly acting on brain stem respiratory centers. Overdose of hydrocodone bitartrate in adults has been associated with fatal respiratory depression, and the use of hydrocodone bitartrate in children less than 6 years of age has been associated with fatal respiratory depression. Exercise caution when administering hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution because of the potential for respiratory depression. If respiratory depression occurs, discontinue hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution and use naloxone hydrochloride when indicated to antagonize the effect and other supportive measures as necessary <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage ( 10)].</span></p><h3>Drug Dependence</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone can produce drug dependence of the morphine type and therefore, has the potential for being abused. Psychic dependence, physical dependence, and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution. Prescribe and administer hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution with the same degree of caution appropriate to the use of other opioid drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.2, 9.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure</h3><p class="First">The respiratory depression effects of opioids and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions, or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. The use of hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution should be avoided in these patients.</p><h3>Activities Requiring Mental Alertness</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate, the active ingredients in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Chlorpheniramine Maleate Oral Solution, may produce marked drowsiness and impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Advise patients to avoid engaging in hazardous tasks requiring mental alertness and motor coordination after ingestion of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Chlorpheniramine Maleate Oral Solution. Concurrent use of hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur.</p><h3>Acute Abdominal Conditions</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution should be used with caution in patients with acute abdominal conditions since the administration of hydrocodone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions. The concurrent use of other anticholinergics with hydrocodone may produce paralytic ileus <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions ( 7.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Co-administration with Anticholinergics</h3><p class="First">The concurrent use of anticholinergics with hydrocodone may produce paralytic ileus. Exercise caution when using hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution in patients taking anticholinergic medications <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions ( 7.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Co-administration with MAOIs or Tricyclic Antidepressants</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate Oral Solution should not be used in patients receiving MAOI therapy or within 14 days of stopping such therapy. The use of MAOIs or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone bitartrate, one of the active ingredients in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Chlorpheniramine Maleate Oral Solution, may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications ( 4) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2)]</span> .</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p class="First">Patients should be advised to measure hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution with an accurate milliliter measuring device. Patients should be informed that a household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage, which can result in serious adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage ( 10)]</span> . Patients should be advised to ask their pharmacist to recommend an appropriate measuring device and for instructions for measuring the correct dose.</p><h3>Coexisting Conditions</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution should be used with caution in patients with thyroid disease, Addison’s disease, prostatic hypertrophy, urethral stricture, or asthma.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6)]</span> .</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7)]</span> .</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Use of hydrocodone bitartrate, a semisynthetic opioid, may result in the following:</p><ul>
<li>Respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2) and Overdosage ( 10)]</span></li>
<li>Drug dependence <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)]</span></li>
<li>Increased intracranial pressure <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4) and Overdosage ( 10)]</span></li>
<li>Decreased mental alertness with impaired mental and/or physical abilities <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5)]</span></li>
<li>Paralytic ileus <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6)]</span></li>
</ul><p>Use of chlorpheniramine, an antihistamine, may result in:</p><ul>
<li>Decreased mental alertness with impaired mental and/or physical abilities <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5)]</span></li>
</ul><p>The following adverse reactions have been identified either during clinical trials of hydrocodone bitartrate and/or chlorpheniramine maleate or during their use post-approval. Because these reactions may be reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions of hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution include: Sedation, somnolence, mental clouding, lethargy, impairment of mental and physical performance, anxiety, fear, dysphoria, dizziness, nausea, psychic dependence, mood changes; blurred, double, or other visual disturbances; confusion, headache, euphoria, facial dyskinesia, feeling faint, lightheadedness, agitation, irritability, tremor.</p><p>Other adverse reactions include:</p><p>Respiratory: Dryness of the pharynx and respiratory passages, occasional tightness of the chest, laryngismus, wheezing, or troubled breathing.</p><p>Gastrointestinal System: Nausea and vomiting (more frequent in ambulatory than in recumbent patients), constipation, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, acute pancreatitis, dry mouth, dyspepsia, epigastric distress, and/or loss of appetite.</p><p>Genitourinary System: Ureteral spasm, spasm of vesicle sphincters, urinary retention, dysuria, urinary frequency, urinary hesitancy.</p><p>Dermatological System: Skin rash, pruritus, erythema, urticaria, excessive perspiration.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">No specific interaction studies have been conducted with hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution.</p><h3>Benzodiazepines, Opioids, Antihistamines, Antipsychotics, Anti-anxiety Agents, or Other CNS Depressants (Including Alcohol)</h3><p class="First">The use of benzodiazepines, opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution may cause an additive CNS depressant effect and should be avoided <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]</span> .</p><h3>MAOIs and Tricyclic Antidepressants</h3><p class="First">Do not prescribe hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution if the patient is taking a prescription MAOI (i.e., certain drugs used for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions, or Parkinson’s disease), or for 2 weeks after stopping a MAOI drug. The use of MAOIs or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8)]</span> .</p><h3>Anticholinergic Drugs</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine should be administered cautiously to persons receiving other anticholinergic drugs in order to avoid paralytic ileus and excessive anticholinergic effects.</p><p>Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade (e.g., xerostomia, blurred vision, or constipation) may occur when anticholinergic drugs are administered with chlorpheniramine <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7)]</span> .</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects:</span> Pregnancy Category C</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution in pregnant women. Reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution; however, studies are available with individual active ingredients or related active ingredients. Hydrocodone was teratogenic in hamsters. Codeine, an opiate related to hydrocodone, increased resorptions and decreased fetal weight in rats. A single retrospective study reported that chlorpheniramine was teratogenic in humans; however, the significance of these findings was not known. Developmental toxicity was also evident with chlorpheniramine in mice and rats. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution should be used during pregnancy only if the benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hydrocodone:</span></p><p>Hydrocodone has been shown to be teratogenic in hamsters when given in a dose approximately 35 times the maximum recommended human daily dose (MRHDD) (on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a single subcutaneous dose of 102 mg/kg on gestation day 8). Reproductive toxicology studies were also conducted with codeine, an opiate related to hydrocodone. In a study in which pregnant rats were dosed throughout organogenesis, a dose of codeine approximately 50 times the MRHDD of hydrocodone (on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis at an oral dose of 120 mg/kg/day of codeine) increased resorptions and decreased fetal weight; however, these effects occurred in the presence of maternal toxicity. In studies in which rabbits and mice were dosed throughout organogenesis, doses of codeine up to approximately 25 and 120 times, respectively, the MRHDD of hydrocodone (on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis at oral doses of 30 and 600 mg/kg/day, respectively), produced no adverse developmental effects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Chlorpheniramine:</span></p><p>A retrospective study found a small, but statistically significant, association between maternal use of chlorpheniramine and inguinal hernia and eye or ear anomalies in children. Other retrospective studies have found that the frequency of congenital anomalies, in general, was not increased among offspring of women who took chlorpheniramine during pregnancy. The significance of these findings to the therapeutic use of chlorpheniramine in human pregnancy is not known.</p><p>In studies with chlorpheniramine in which pregnant rats and rabbits were dosed throughout organogenesis, oral doses up to approximately 20 and 25 times the MRHDD on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively, produced no adverse developmental effects. However, when mice were dosed throughout pregnancy, a dose approximately 5 times the MRHDD (on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis at an oral dose of 20 mg/kg/day) was embryolethal, and postnatal survival was decreased when dosing was continued after parturition. Embryolethality was also observed when male and female rats were dosed with approximately 5 times the MRHDD (on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis at an oral dose of 10 mg/kg/day) prior to mating.</p><p><span class="Italics">Nonteratogenic Effects:</span> Babies born to mothers who have been taking opioids regularly prior to delivery will be physically dependent. The withdrawal signs include irritability and excessive crying, tremors, hyperactive reflexes, increased respiratory rate, increased stools, sneezing, yawning, vomiting, and fever. The intensity of the syndrome does not always correlate with the duration of maternal opioid use or dose.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">As with all opioids, administration of hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution to the mother shortly before delivery may result in some degree of respiratory depression in the newborn, especially if higher doses are used.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Caution should be exercised when hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution is administered to nursing mothers. Hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine are excreted in human milk. The clinical significance is unknown; however, the anticholinergic action of chlorpheniramine may suppress lactation if taken prior to nursing. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established. The use of hydrocodone in children less than 6 years of age has been associated with fatal respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies have not been conducted with hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution. Other reported clinical experience with the individual active ingredients of hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and patients younger than 65 years of age. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be made with caution, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution be given with caution in patients with severe impairment of renal function.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution should be given with caution in patients with severe impairment of hepatic function.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution is a Schedule II controlled prescription containing hydrocodone bitartrate and should be prescribed and administered with caution.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone can produce drug dependence of the morphine type and therefore, has the potential for being abused. Psychic dependence, physical dependence, and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution, and it should be prescribed and administered with the same degree of caution appropriate to the use of other opioid drugs.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Psychic dependence, physical dependence, and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of opioids; therefore, hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution Solution should be prescribed and administered with caution.</p><p>Physical dependence, the condition in which continued administration of the drug is required to prevent the appearance of a withdrawal syndrome, assumes clinically significant proportions only after several weeks of continued oral opioid use, although some mild degree of physical dependence may develop after a few days of opioid therapy.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">No human overdosage data are available for hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hydrocodone</span>:</p><p>Overdosage with hydrocodone is characterized by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, and sometimes bradycardia and hypotension. In severe overdosage, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death may occur.</p><p><span class="Bold">Chlorpheniramine</span>:</p><p>Manifestations of chlorpheniramine overdosage may vary from central nervous system depression to stimulation. Central toxic effects are characterized by agitation, anxiety, delirium, disorientation, hallucinations, hyperactivity, sedation, and seizures. Severe overdosage may produce coma, medullary paralysis, and death. Peripheral toxicity includes hypertension, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, vasodilation, hyperpyrexia, mydriasis, urinary retention, and diminished gastrointestinal motility. Dry mouth, pharynx, bronchi, and nasal passages may be observed.</p><p>Impaired secretion from sweat glands following toxic doses of drugs with anticholinergic side effects may predispose to hyperthermia.</p><p>An adult ingested 400 mg chlorpheniramine with no reported serious adverse effects. Toxic psychosis, a possible class effect from overdose of sedating antihistamines, has been reported with accidental overdose of chlorpheniramine.</p><p>Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution together with institution of appropriate therapy. Primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. The opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride is a specific antidote for respiratory depression which may result from overdosage or unusual sensitivity to opioids including hydrocodone. Therefore, an appropriate dose of naloxone hydrochloride should be administered, preferably by the intravenous route, simultaneously with efforts at respiratory resuscitation. For further information, see full prescribing information for naloxone hydrochloride. An antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory depression. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated. Gastric emptying may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug.</p><p>Hemodialysis is not routinely used to enhance the elimination of chlorpheniramine from the body. Urinary excretion of chlorpheniramine is increased when the pH of the urine is acidic; however, acid diuresis is NOT recommended to enhance elimination in overdose, as the risks of acidemia and acute tubular necrosis in patients with rhabdomyolysis far outweigh any potential benefit.</p><h2>Hydrocodone and Chlorpheniramine Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution contains hydrocodone bitartrate (a semisynthetic centrally-acting opioid antitussive) and chlorpheniramine maleate (an antihistamine).</p><p>Each 5 mL dose of hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution contains: hydrocodone bitartrate, USP, 5 mg and chlorpheniramine maleate, USP, 4 mg.</p><p>Hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution also contains: citric acid anhydrous, glycerin, grape flavor, methylparaben, propylene glycol, propylparaben, purified water, sodium citrate, sodium saccharin, and sucrose.</p><p>Hydrocodone bitartrate is morphinan-6-one, 4,5-epoxy-3-methoxy-17-methyl-, (5α)-, [ <span class="Italics">R-</span>( <span class="Italics">R*</span>, <span class="Italics">R*</span>)]-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioate (1:1), hydrate (2:5); also known as 4,5α-Epoxy-3-methoxy-17-methylmorphinan-6-one tartrate (1:1) hydrate (2:5); a fine white crystal or crystalline powder, which is derived from the opium alkaloid, thebaine; and may be represented by the following structural formula:</p><p>Chlorpheniramine maleate is 2-pyridinepropanamine, γ-(4-chlorophenyl)- <span class="Italics">N</span>, <span class="Italics">N</span>-dimethyl-, ( <span class="Italics">Z</span>)-2-butenedioate (1:1) and has the following chemical structure:</p><h2>Hydrocodone and Chlorpheniramine Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic narcotic antitussive and analgesic with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine. The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opiates is not known; however, hydrocodone is believed to act directly on the cough center. In excessive doses, hydrocodone will depress respiration. Hydrocodone can produce miosis, euphoria, and physical and physiological dependence.</p><p>Chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine drug (H <span class="Sub">1</span> receptor antagonist) that also possesses anticholinergic and sedative activity. It prevents released histamine from dilating capillaries and causing edema of the respiratory mucosa.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Systemic exposure (in terms of peak plasma concentrations and area under plasma concentration versus time curve) of hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate after single dose administration of 5 mL hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution are equivalent to respective reference solutions of 5 mL hydrocodone bitartrate (5 mg/5 mL), and 5 mL chlorpheniramine maleate (4 mg/5 mL).</p><p>Hydrocodone had mean (SD) peak plasma concentration of 10.6 (2.63) ng/mL at 1.4 (0.55) hours. The mean plasma half-life of hydrocodone is approximately 4.9 hours. Chlorpheniramine had a mean (SD) plasma peak concentration of 7.20 (1.98) ng/mL at 3.5 (1.6) hours. The mean plasma half-life of chlorpheniramine is approximately 24 hours.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and reproductive studies have not been conducted with hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine maleate oral solution; however, published information is available for the individual active ingredients or related active ingredients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hydrocodone:</span></p><p>Carcinogenicity studies were conducted with codeine, an opiate related to hydrocodone.
