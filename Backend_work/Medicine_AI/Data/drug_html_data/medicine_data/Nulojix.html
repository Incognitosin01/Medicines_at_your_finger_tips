Organ rejection happens when the immune system treats the new organ as an invader and attacks it.</p><p>Nulojix is used with other medicines to prevent organ rejection after a kidney transplant.</p><p>Nulojix is given only to people who have been exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (your doctor will test your blood to confirm this).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Nulojix if you have received a liver transplant. Before you start treatment, your doctor will perform tests to make sure you are immune to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV-positive). Your risk of serious infection is higher if you have never been exposed to EBV.</p><p>Nulojix may cause your body to overproduce white blood cells. This can lead to cancer, severe brain infection causing disability or death, or a viral infection causing kidney transplant failure.</p><p><b>Call your doctor right away if you have</b>: fever, swollen glands, flu symptoms, night sweats, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, burning when you urinate, blood in your urine, a new skin lesion, any change in your mental state, decreased vision, weakness on one side of your body, problems with speech or walking, or pain around your transplant.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with Nulojix if you are allergic to belatacept, or if you've never been exposed to Epstein-Barr virus.</p><p><b>Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of using this medicine.</b> Nulojix can affect your immune system, and may cause overproduction of certain white blood cells. This can lead to cancer, severe brain infection causing disability or death, or a viral infection causing kidney transplant failure.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully.</p><p>Belatacept can increase your risk of infection by changing the way your immune system works. You will need frequent medical tests.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">What other drugs will affect Nulojix?</h2><p>Other drugs may interact with belatacept, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.
