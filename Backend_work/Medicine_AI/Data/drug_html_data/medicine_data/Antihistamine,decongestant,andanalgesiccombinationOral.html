</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for this Medicine</h2><p>In November 2000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public health warning regarding phenylpropanolamine (PPA) due to the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. The FDA, supported by results of a research program, requested that manufacturers voluntarily discontinue marketing products that contain PPA and that consumers work with their healthcare providers to select alternative products.</p><p>Antihistamine, decongestant, and analgesic combinations are taken by mouth to relieve the sneezing, runny nose, sinus and nasal congestion (stuffy nose), fever, headache, and aches and pain of colds, influenza, and hay fever. These combinations do not contain any ingredient to relieve coughs.</p><p>Antihistamines are used to relieve or prevent the symptoms of hay fever and other types of allergy. They may also help relieve some symptoms of the common cold, such as sneezing and runny nose. They work by preventing the effects of a substance called histamine, which is produced by the body. Antihistamines contained in these combinations are:</p><p>brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, dexbrompheniramine, diphenhydramine, pheniramine, phenyltoloxamine, pyrilamine, and triprolidine.</p><p>Decongestants, such as phenylephrine, and pseudoephedrine, produce a narrowing of blood vessels. This leads to clearing of nasal congestion, but it may also cause an increase in blood pressure in patients who have high blood pressure.</p><p>Analgesics, such as acetaminophen and salicylates (e.g., aspirin, sodium salicylate), are used in these combination medicines to help relieve fever, headache, aches, and pain.</p><p>Some of these medicines are available without a prescription. However, your doctor may have special instructions on the proper dose of these medicines for your medical condition.</p><p><i>Do not give any over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicine to a baby or child under 4 years of age.</i> Using these medicines in very young children might cause serious or possibly life-threatening side effects .</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using this Medicine</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Very young children are usually more sensitive to the effects of this medicine. Increases in blood pressure, nightmares, unusual excitement, nervousness, restlessness, or irritability may be more likely to occur in children. Also, mental changes may be more likely to occur in young children taking these combination medicines.</p><p><i>Do not give any over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicine to a baby or child under 4 years of age.</i> Using these medicines in very young children might cause serious or possibly life-threatening side effects .</p><p><i>Before giving any of these combination medicines to a child, check the package label very carefully. Some of these medicines are too strong for use in children</i>. If you are not certain whether a specific product can be given to a child, or if you have any questions about the amount to give, check with your health care professional.</p><p><i>Do not give aspirin or other salicylates to a child or teenager with a fever or other symptoms of a virus infection, especially flu or chickenpox, without first discussing their use with your child's doctor</i>. This is very important because salicylates may cause a serious illness called Reye's syndrome in children and teenagers with fever caused by a virus infection, especially flu or chickenpox. Also, children may be more sensitive to the aspirin or other salicylates contained in some of these medicines, especially if they have a fever or have lost large amounts of body fluid because of vomiting, diarrhea, or sweating.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>The elderly are usually more sensitive to the effects of this medicine. Confusion, difficult or painful urination, dizziness, drowsiness, feeling faint, or dryness of mouth, nose, or throat may be more likely to occur in elderly patients. Also, nightmares or unusual excitement, nervousness, restlessness, or irritability may be more likely to occur in the elderly.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>The occasional use of antihistamine, decongestant, and analgesic combinations is not likely to cause problems in the fetus or in the newborn baby. However, when these medicines are used at higher doses and/or for a long time, the chance that problems might occur may increase. For the individual ingredients of these combinations, the following apply:</p><ul>
<li>Acetaminophen—Acetaminophen has not been shown to cause birth defects or other problems in humans. However, studies on birth defects have not been done in humans.</li>
<li>Alcohol—Some of these combination medicines contain large amounts of alcohol. Too much use of alcohol during pregnancy may cause birth defects.</li>
<li>Antihistamines—Antihistamines have not been shown to cause problems in humans.</li>
<li>Caffeine—Studies in humans have not shown that caffeine causes birth defects. However, studies in animals have shown that caffeine causes birth defects when given in very large doses (amounts equal to the amount of caffeine contained in 12 to 24 cups of coffee a day).</li>
<li>Phenylephrine—Studies on birth defects have not been done in either humans or animals with phenylephrine.</li>
<li>Pseudoephedrine—Studies on birth defects with pseudoephedrine have not been done in humans. In animal studies pseudoephedrine did not cause birth defects but did cause a decrease in average weight, length, and rate of bone formation in the animal fetus when administered in high doses.</li>
<li>Salicylates (e.g., aspirin)—Salicylates have not been shown to cause birth defects in humans. Studies on birth defects in humans have been done with aspirin. However, salicylates have been shown to cause birth defects in animals.</li>
</ul><p>Regular use of salicylates late in pregnancy may cause unwanted effects on the heart or blood flow in the fetus or newborn baby. Use of salicylates during the last 2 weeks of pregnancy may cause bleeding problems in the fetus before or during delivery, or in the newborn baby. Also, too much use of salicylates during the last 3 months of pregnancy may increase the length of pregnancy, prolong labor, cause other problems during delivery, or cause severe bleeding in the mother before, during, or after delivery. <i>Do not take aspirin during the last 3 months of pregnancy unless it has been ordered by your doctor</i>.</p><h3>Breast Feeding</h3><p>If you are breast-feeding the chance that problems might occur depends on the ingredients of the combination. For the individual ingredients of these combinations, the following apply:</p><ul>
<li>Acetaminophen—Acetaminophen passes into the breast milk. However, it has not been shown to cause problems in nursing babies.</li>
<li>Alcohol—Alcohol passes into the breast milk. However, the amount of alcohol in recommended doses of this medicine does not usually cause problems in nursing babies.</li>
<li>Antihistamines—Use is not recommended since the chances are greater for this medicine to cause side effects, such as unusual excitement or irritability, in the nursing baby. Also, since antihistamines tend to decrease the secretions of the body, it is possible that the flow of breast milk may be reduced in some women.</li>
<li>Caffeine—Small amounts of caffeine pass into the breast milk and may build up in the nursing baby. However, the amount of caffeine in recommended doses of this medicine does not usually cause problems in nursing babies.</li>
<li>Decongestants (e.g., phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine)—Decongestants may pass into the breast milk and may cause unwanted effects in nursing babies of mothers taking this medicine.</li>
<li>Salicylates (e.g., aspirin)—Salicylates pass into the breast milk. Although salicylates have not been reported to cause problems in nursing babies, it is possible that problems may occur if large amounts are taken regularly.&lt;</li>

</ul><h3>Other Medical Problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Alcohol abuse—Acetaminophen-containing medicines increase the chance of liver damage</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Asthma, allergies, and nasal polyps, history of, or</li>
<li>Asthma attacks—Taking a salicylate-containing medicine may cause an allergic reaction in which breathing becomes difficult; also, although antihistamines open tightened bronchial passages, other effects of the antihistamines may cause secretions to become thick so that during an asthma attack it might be difficult to cough them up</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Type 2 diabetes mellitus—The decongestant in this medicine may put the patient with diabetes at a greater risk of having heart or blood vessel disease</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Enlarged prostate or</li>
<li>Urinary tract blockage or difficult urination—Some of the effects of antihistamines may cause urinary problems to get worse</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Glaucoma—A slight increase in inner eye pressure may occur</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Gout—Aspirin- or sodium salicylate-containing medicine may make the gout worse and reduce the benefit of the medicines used for gout</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Heart or blood vessel disease or</li>
<li>High blood pressure—The decongestant in this medicine may cause the blood pressure to increase and may also speed up the heart rate; also, caffeine-containing medicine, if taken in large amounts, may have a similar effect on the heart</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Hemophilia or other bleeding problems—Aspirin- or sodium salicylate-containing medicine increases the chance of bleeding</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Hepatitis or other liver disease—There is a greater chance of side effects because the medicine is not broken down and may build up in the body; also, if liver disease is severe there is a greater chance that aspirin-containing medicine may cause bleeding</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Kidney disease (severe)—The kidneys may be affected, especially if too much of this medicine is taken for a long time</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Overactive thyroid—If the overactive thyroid has caused a fast heart rate, the decongestant in this medicine may cause the heart rate to speed up further</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Stomach ulcer or other stomach problems—Salicylate-containing medicine may make the ulcer worse or cause bleeding of the stomach</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of this Medicine</h2><p><i>Take this medicine only as directed</i>.

The results of the test may be affected by the antihistamine in this medicine.</p><p>Check with your doctor if your symptoms do not improve or become worse, or if you have a high fever.</p><p>The antihistamine in this medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (medicines that slow down the nervous system, possibly causing drowsiness). Some examples of CNS depressants are other antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds; sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine; prescription pain medicine or narcotics; barbiturates; medicine for seizures; muscle relaxants; or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. <i>Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are taking this medicine</i>.</p><p>Also, stomach problems may be more likely to occur if you drink alcoholic beverages while taking a medicine that contains aspirin. In addition, drinking large amounts of alcoholic beverages while taking a medicine that contains acetaminophen may cause liver damage.</p><p>The antihistamine in this medicine may cause some people to become drowsy, dizzy, or less alert than they are normally. <i>Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or are not alert</i>.</p><p>The decongestant in this medicine may cause some people to become nervous or restless or to have trouble in sleeping. If you have trouble in sleeping, <i>take the last dose of this medicine for each day a few hours before bedtime</i>. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.</p><p>Also, this medicine may add to the CNS stimulant and other effects of diet aids. <i>Do not use medicines for diet or appetite control while taking this medicine unless you have checked with your doctor</i>.</p><p>Before having any kind of surgery (including dental surgery) or emergency treatment, tell the medical doctor or dentist in charge that you are taking this medicine.</p><p>Antihistamines may cause dryness of the mouth, nose, and throat. For temporary relief of mouth dryness, use sugarless candy or gum, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. However, if your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.</p><p><i>Check the label of all over-the-counter (OTC), nonprescription, and prescription medicines you now take</i>. If any contain acetaminophen or aspirin or other salicylates, including diflunisal or bismuth subsalicylate (e.g., Pepto-Bismol), be especially careful. This combination medicine contains acetaminophen and/or a salicylate. Therefore, taking it while taking any other medicine that contains these drugs may lead to overdose. If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional.</p><p>For patients taking <i>aspirin-containing medicine</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Do not take aspirin-containing medicine within 5 days before any surgery, including dental surgery, unless otherwise directed by your medical doctor or dentist. Taking aspirin during this time may cause bleeding problems.</li>
</ul><p>For diabetic patients taking <i>salicylate-containing medicine</i>, false urine sugar test results may occur:</p><ul>
<li>If you take 8 or more 325-mg doses of aspirin every day for several days in a row.</li>
<li>If you take 8 or more 325-mg, or 4 or more 500-mg, doses of sodium salicylate a day.</li>
