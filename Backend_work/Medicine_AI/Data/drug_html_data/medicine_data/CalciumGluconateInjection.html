Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be avoided in patients receiving cardiac glycosides. If concomitant therapy is necessary, Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be given slowly in small amounts and with close ECG monitoring <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><h3>End-Organ Damage due to Intravascular Ceftriaxone-Calcium Precipitates</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in neonates (28 days of age or younger) due to cases of fatal outcomes in neonates in which a crystalline material was observed in the lungs and kidneys at autopsy after ceftriaxone and calcium were administrated simultaneously through the same intravenous line. Concomitant administration can lead to the formation of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates that may act as emboli, resulting in vascular spasm or infarction <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><p>In patients older than 28 days of age, ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection may be administered sequentially, provided the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid. Do not administer Ceftriaxone simultaneously with Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection via a Y-site in any age group.</p><h3>Tissue Necrosis and Calcinosis</h3><p class="First">Intravenous administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection and local trauma may result in calcinosis cutis due to transient increase in local calcium concentration. Calcinosis cutis can occur with or without extravasation of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection, is characterized by abnormal dermal deposits of calcium salts, and clinically manifests as papules, plaques, or nodules that may be associated with erythema, swelling, or induration. Tissue necrosis, ulceration, and secondary infection are the most serious complications.</p><p>If extravasation occurs or clinical manifestations of calcinosis cutis are noted, immediately discontinue intravenous administration at that site and treat as needed.</p><h3>Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Cardiac Arrhythmias with Rapid Administration</h3><p class="First">Rapid injection of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection may cause vasodilation, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, syncope and cardiac arrest. To avoid adverse reactions that may follow rapid intravenous administration, Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be infused slowly. If rapid intravenous bolus of Calcium Gluconate Injection is required, the rate of intravenous administration should not exceed 200 mg/minute in adults and 100 mg/minute in pediatric patients and ECG monitoring during administration is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Aluminum Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection contains aluminum, up to 25 mcg per liter, that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 mcg/kg/day to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are also described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><p>• Arrhythmias with Concomitant Cardiac Glycoside Use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></p><p>• End-Organ Damage due to Intravascular Ceftriaxone-Calcium Precipitates <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></p><p>• Tissue Necrosis and Calcinosis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></p><p>• Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Cardiac Arrhythmias <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></p><p>• Aluminum toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span></p><p>The following adverse reactions associated with the use of calcium gluconate were identified in the literature. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular</span></span>: Vasodilation, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, syncope, cardiac arrest</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Administration site reactions</span></span>: Local soft tissue inflammation, local necrosis, calcinosis cutis and calcification due to extravasation</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Cardiac Glycosides</h3><p class="First">Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, while digoxin may be therapeutically ineffective in the presence of hypocalcemia. Synergistic arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. Avoid administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection in patients receiving cardiac glycosides; if considered necessary, administer Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection slowly in small amounts and monitor ECG closely during administration.</p><h3>Calcium Channel Blockers</h3><p class="First">Administration of calcium may reduce the response to calcium channel blockers.</p><h3>Drugs that may cause Hypercalcemia</h3><p class="First">Vitamin D, vitamin A, thiazide diuretics, estrogen, calcipotriene and teriparatide administration may cause hypercalcemia. Monitor plasma calcium concentrations in patients taking these drugs concurrently.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk summary</span></p><p>Limited available data with Calcium Gluconate Injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with hypocalcemia in pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Considerations]</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-associated maternal risk</span></p><p>Maternal hypocalcemia can result in an increased rate of spontaneous abortion, premature and dysfunctional labor, and possibly preeclampsia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions</span></p><p>Infants born to mothers with hypocalcemia can have associated fetal and neonatal hyperparathyroidism, which in turn can cause fetal and neonatal skeletal demineralization, subperiosteal bone resorption, osteitis fibrosa cystica and neonatal seizures. Infants born to mothers with hypocalcemia should be carefully monitored for signs of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia, including neuromuscular irritability, apnea, cyanosis and cardiac rhythm disorders.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk summary</span></p><p>Calcium is present in human milk as a natural component of human milk. It is not known whether intravenous administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection can alter calcium concentration in human milk. There are no data on the effects of Calcium Gluconate Injection on the breastfed infant, or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection have been established in pediatric patients for the treatment of acute, symptomatic hypocalcemia.</p><p>Pediatric approval for Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection, including doses, is not based on adequate and well-controlled clinical studies. Safety and dosing recommendations in pediatric patients are based on published literature and clinical experience <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><p>Concomitant use of ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in neonates (28 days of age or younger) due to reports of fatal outcomes associated with the presence of lung and kidney ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates. In patients older than 28 days of age, ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate Injection may be administered sequentially, provided the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>. This product contains up to 25 mcg/L aluminum which may be toxic, particularly for premature neonates due to immature renal function. Parenteral administration of aluminum greater than 4 mcg/kg/day to 5 mcg/kg/day is associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In general dose selection for an elderly patient should start at the lowest dose of the recommended dose range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">For patients with renal impairment, initiate Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection at the lowest dose of the recommended dose ranges across all age groups. Monitor serum calcium levels every 4 hours <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Hepatic function does not impact the availability of ionized calcium after calcium gluconate intravenous administration. Dose adjustment in hepatically impaired patients may not be necessary.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdosage of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection may result in hypercalcemia. Symptoms of hypercalcemia typically develop when the total serum calcium concentration is ≥12 mg/dL. Neurologic symptoms include depression, weakness, fatigue, and confusion at lower levels, with patients experiencing hallucinations, disorientation, hypotonicity, seizures, and coma. Effects on the kidney include diminished ability to concentrate urine and diuresis.</p><p>If overdose of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection occurs immediately discontinue administration and provide supportive treatments to restore intravascular volume as well as promote calcium excretion in the urine if necessary.</p><h2>Calcium Gluconate Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection is a sterile, preservative-free, nonpyrogenic solution of calcium gluconate, a form of calcium, for intravenous use.</p><p>Calcium Gluconate is calcium D-gluconate (1:2) monohydrate. The structural formula is:</p><p>Molecular formula: C<span class="Sub">12</span>H<span class="Sub">22</span>CaO<span class="Sub">14</span>• H<span class="Sub">2</span>O</p><p>Molecular weight: 448.39</p><p>Solubility in water: 3.5 g/100 mL at 25°C</p><p>Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection is available as 1,000 mg per 50 mL (18.8 mg per mL) or 2,000 mg per 100 mL (18.8 mg per mL) in single-dose bags.</p><p>Each mL of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection contains 20 mg of calcium gluconate (equivalent to 18.8 mg of calcium gluconate and 0.9 mg of calcium saccharate tetrahydrate), hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment (6.0 to 8.2) and sodium chloride 6.75 mg/mL as tonicity adjustor.</p><p>Each mL of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection contains 1.86 mg (0.093 mEq) of elemental calcium.</p><h2>Calcium Gluconate Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Intravenous administration of calcium gluconate increases serum ionized calcium level. Calcium gluconate dissociates into ionized calcium in plasma. Ionized calcium and gluconate are constituents of body fluids.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Calcium Gluconate Injection is 100% bioavailable following intravenous injection.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Calcium itself does not undergo direct metabolism. The release of ionized calcium from intravenous administration of calcium gluconate is direct and does not seem to be affected by the first pass through the liver.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Calcium in the body is distributed mainly in skeleton (99%). Only 1% of the total body calcium is distributed within the extracellular fluids and soft tissues. About 50% of total serum calcium is in the ionized form and represents the biologically active part. 8% to 10% serum calcium is bound to organic and inorganic acid and approximately 40% is protein-bound (primarily to albumin).</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Studies have shown a relationship between urinary calcium excretion and the intravenous administration of calcium gluconate, with a significant increase in urinary calcium excretion observed after the intravenous administration of calcium gluconate.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection. Calcium gluconate was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames test with <span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span> (strains TA-1535, TA-1537, and TA-1538) or <span class="Italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> (Strain D4). Fertility studies in animals have not been conducted with calcium gluconate administered by the intravenous route.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection is a clear, colorless solution supplied in single-dose bags with an aluminum overwrap available as:</p><p class="First">Total Strength per Total Volume</p><p class="First">Strength per mL</p><p class="First">24 single-dose bags NDC</p><p class="First">Bag and Overwrap NDC</p><p class="First">1,000 mg per 50 mL</p><p class="First">20 mg/mL</p><p class="First">44567-620-24*</p><p class="First">44567-620-01</p><p class="First">2,000 mg per 100 mL</p><p class="First">20 mg/mL</p><p class="First">44567-621-24</p><p class="First">44567-621-01</p><p>*partial fill container 50 mL volume in a 100 mL container.</p><p>Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].
