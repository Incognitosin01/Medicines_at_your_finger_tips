Each weight marking on the syringe plunger delivers enough paste to treat 250 lb body weight.</p><p>(1) While holding plunger, turn the knurled ring on the plunger 1/4 turn to the left and slide it so the side nearest the barrel is at the prescribed weight marking. (2) Lock the ring in place by making a 1/4 turn to the right. (3) Make sure that the horse's mouth contains no feed. (4) Remove the cover from the tip of the syringe. (5) Insert the syringe tip into the horse's mouth at the space between the teeth. (6) Depress the plunger as far as it will go, depositing paste on the back of the tongue. (7) Immediately raise the horse's head for a few seconds after dosing.</p><h2>PARASITE CONTROL PROGRAM</h2><p class="First">All horses should be included in a regular parasite control program with particular attention being paid to mares, foals and yearlings. Foals should be treated initially at 2 months of age, and routine treatment repeated as appropriate. Consult your veterinarian for a control program to meet your specific needs.</p><p>ZIMECTERIN<span class="Sup">®</span> GOLD Paste effectively controls gastrointestinal cestodes, nematodes and bots of horses.

ZIMECTERIN<span class="Sup">®</span> GOLD Paste is a potent antiparasitic agent that is neither a benzimidazole nor an organophosphate.</p><h3>ANIMAL SAFETY</h3><p class="First">ZIMECTERIN<span class="Sup">®</span> GOLD Paste may be used in horses two months of age or older. ZIMECTERIN<span class="Sup">®</span> GOLD Paste has not been tested in foals younger than two months of age, mares at or near the time of breeding, pregnant or lactating mares, and breeding stallions. ZIMECTERIN<span class="Sup">®</span> GOLD Paste, when tested at 1, 3 and 5-times the maximum recommended dose every two weeks in 5-month old foals, and at 10-times the maximum recommended dose in a separate study, did not elicit any adverse clinical signs of toxicity. In a foal safety study in younger animals, ZIMECTERIN<span class="Sup">®</span> GOLD Paste was found safe at up to 3-times the maximum recommended dose in 2-month old foals.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Do not use in horses intended for human consumption.

This product should not be used in other animal species as severe adverse reactions, including fatalities in dogs, may result.</p><h3>Post-Approval Experience</h3><p class="First">Although not all adverse reactions are reported, the following reactions are based on voluntary post-approval drug experience reporting. There have been rare reports of swelling and irritation of the mouth, lips, and tongue following administration of ZIMECTERIN<span class="Sup">®</span> GOLD. These reactions have been transitory in nature.</p><h3>Environmental Safety</h3><p class="First">Ivermectin and excreted ivermectin residues may adversely affect aquatic organisms. Do not contaminate ground or surface water. Dispose of the syringe in an approved landfill or by incineration.</p><h3>Information For Horse Owners</h3><p class="First">Swelling and itching reactions after treatment with ivermectin have occurred in horses carrying heavy infections of neck threadworm (<span class="Italics">Onchocerca</span> sp.) microfilariae. These reactions were most likely the result of microfilariae dying in large numbers. Symptomatic treatment may be advisable. Consult your veterinarian should any such reactions occur. Healing of summer sores involving extensive tissue changes may require other appropriate therapy in conjunction with treatment with ZIMECTERIN<span class="Sup">®</span> GOLD Paste. Reinfection, and measures for its prevention, should also be considered. Consult your veterinarian if the condition does not improve.</p><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Store up to 86°F (30°C).
