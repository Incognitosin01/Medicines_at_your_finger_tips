Patients with impaired renal function, advanced age, dehydration, and those who receive high dosage or prolonged therapy are at an increased risk of toxicity. Monitor renal and auditory function during therapy and discontinue therapy or adjust dose if there is evidence of ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is usually irreversible. Serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored when feasible to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have also been reported following administration. Concurrent use of other potentially neurotoxic or nephrotoxic agents, or potent diuretics should be avoided .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>
