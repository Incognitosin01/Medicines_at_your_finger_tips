Amlodipine relaxes (widens) blood vessels and improves blood flow.</p><p>Benazepril is an ACE inhibitor. ACE stands for angiotensin converting enzyme. Benazepril also widens blood vessels and also prevents the body from retaining water.</p><p>Lotrel is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).</p><p>Lotrel may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use Lotrel if you are pregnant.
