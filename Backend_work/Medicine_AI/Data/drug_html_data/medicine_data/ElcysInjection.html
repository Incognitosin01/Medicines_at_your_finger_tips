</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Elcys Injection</h2><p class="First">ELCYS is indicated for use as an additive to amino acid solutions to meet the nutritional requirements of newborn infants</p><p>requiring total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and of adult and pediatric patients with severe liver disease who may have</p><p>impaired enzymatic processes and require TPN. It can also be added to amino acid solutions to provide a more complete</p><p>profile of amino acids for protein synthesis.</p><h2>Elcys Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Information</h3><p class="First">ELCYS is for <span class="Italics">admixing use</span> only. It is <span class="Italics">not for direct intravenous infusion</span>. Prior to administration, ELCYS <span class="Italics">must be diluted</span></p><p><span class="Italics">and used as an admixture</span> in parenteral nutrition (PN) solutions.</p><p>The resulting solution is for intravenous infusion into a central or peripheral vein. The choice of a central or peripheral</p><p>venous route should depend on the osmolarity of the final infusate. Solutions with osmolarity of 900 mOsm/L or greater</p><p>must be infused through a central catheter <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Preparation and Administration Instructions</h3><h3>Preparation Instructions for Admixing Using a Parenteral Nutrition (PN) Container</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Stability and Storage</span></p><h3>Dosing Considerations</h3><h3>Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients and Adults</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage and volume of ELCYS is shown in Table 1 and is based upon the recommended daily protein</p><p>(amino acids) requirement. For pediatric patients from birth to less than 12 years of age, the recommended dosage of</p><p>ELCYS is 22 mg/gram of amino acids. For adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older, the recommended</p><p>dosage of ELCYS is 7 mg/gram of amino acids.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1. Recommended Daily Dosage of ELCYS in Pediatric Patients and Adults</span></p><p class="First">Preterm and term infants less than 1 month of age</p><p class="First">Pediatric patients 1 month to less than 1 year of age</p><p class="First">Pediatric patients 1 year to 11 years of age</p><p class="First">Pediatric patients 12 years to 17 years of age</p><p class="First">Adults: Stable Patients</p><p class="First">Adults: Critically Ill Patientsb</p><p>AA = Amino Acid</p><p>a Protein is provided as amino acids (AA).</p><p>b Includes patients requiring more than 2 to 3 days in the intensive care unit with organ failure, sepsis or postoperative major surgery. Do not use in patients with</p><p>conditions that are contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span></p><p>ELCYS contains 50 mg/mL of cysteine hydrochloride (equivalent to 34.5 mg/mL of cysteine). Therefore, the ELCYS</p><p>dosages in Table 1 provide:</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Injection: 500 mg/10 mL (50 mg/mL) cysteine hydrochloride, USP as a clear, colorless, sterile solution in a 10 mL single-dose vial.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">ELCYS is contraindicated in:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Pulmonary Embolism due to Pulmonary Vascular Precipitates</h3><p class="First">Pulmonary vascular precipitates causing pulmonary vascular emboli and pulmonary distress have been reported in</p><p>patients receiving PN. In some fatal cases, pulmonary embolism occurred as a result of calcium phosphate precipitates.</p><p>Precipitation following passage through an in-line filter and suspected in vivo precipitate formation has also been</p><p>reported. If signs of pulmonary distress occur, stop the PN infusion and initiate a medical evaluation. In addition to</p><p>inspection of the solution <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]</span>, the infusion set and catheter should also</p><p>periodically be checked for precipitates.</p><h3>Vein Damage and Thrombosis</h3><p class="First">ELCYS must be diluted and used as an admixture in PN solutions. It is not for direct intravenous infusion. Solutions with</p><p>an osmolarity of 900 mOsm/L or greater must be infused through a central catheter <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration</span></p><p><span class="Italics">(2.1)]</span>. The infusion of hypertonic nutrient injections into a peripheral vein may result in vein irritation, vein damage,</p><p>and/or thrombosis. The primary complication of peripheral access is venous thrombophlebitis, which manifests as pain,</p><p>erythema, tenderness or a palpable cord. Remove the catheter as soon as possible, if thrombophlebitis develops.</p><h3>Increased Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)</h3><p class="First">Intravenous infusion of amino acids may induce a rise in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), especially in patients with impaired</p><p>hepatic or renal function. Appropriate laboratory tests should be performed periodically and infusion discontinued if BUN</p><p>levels exceed normal postprandial limits and continue to rise. It should be noted that a modest rise in BUN normally</p><p>occurs as a result of increased protein intake.</p><p>Administration of amino acid solutions in the presence of impaired renal function may augment an increasing BUN, as</p><p>does any protein dietary component.</p><h3>Acid-Base Imbalance</h3><p class="First">Administration of ELCYS may result in metabolic acidosis in preterm infants.</p><p>Administration of amino acid solutions to a patient with hepatic impairment may result in serum amino acid imbalances,</p><p>metabolic alkalosis, prerenal azotemia, hyperammonemia, stupor and coma.</p><p>Frequent clinical evaluation and laboratory determinations are necessary for proper monitoring of acid-base balance</p><p>during parenteral nutrition therapy. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require the use of additional</p><p>electrolyte supplements.</p><h3>Hepatobiliary Disorders</h3><p class="First">Hepatobiliary disorders are known to develop in some patients without preexisting liver disease who receive PN,</p><p>including cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, cholestasis, hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and cirrhosis, possibly leading to hepatic</p><p>failure. The etiology of these disorders is thought to be multifactorial and may differ between patients.</p><p>Monitor liver function parameters and ammonia levels. Patients developing signs of hepatobiliary disorders should be</p><p>assessed early by a clinician knowledgeable in liver diseases in order to identify possible causative and contributory</p><p>factors, and possible therapeutic and prophylactic interventions.</p><h3>Hyperammonemia</h3><p class="First">Hyperammonemia is of special significance in infants, as it can result in neurocognitive delays. Therefore, it is essential</p><p>that blood ammonia levels be measured frequently in infants.</p><p>Instances of asymptomatic hyperammonemia have been reported in patients without overt liver dysfunction. The</p><p>mechanisms of this reaction are not clearly defined but may involve genetic defects and immature or subclinically</p><p>impaired liver function <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Aluminum Toxicity</h3><p class="First">ELCYS contains aluminum that may be toxic.</p><p>Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment. Preterm</p><p>infants are particularly at risk for aluminum toxicity because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts</p><p>of calcium and phosphate solutions, which also contain aluminum.</p><p>Patients with renal impairment, including preterm infants, who receive greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day of parenteral</p><p>aluminum can accumulate aluminum to levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading</p><p>may occur at even lower rates of administration.</p><p>Exposure to aluminum from ELCYS is not more than 0.21 mcg/kg/day when preterm and term infants less than 1 month</p><p>of age are administered the recommended maximum dosage of ELCYS (15 mg cysteine/g of amino acids and 4 g of</p><p>amino acids/kg/day) <span class="Italics">[see Table 1, Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>. When prescribing ELCYS for use in PN containing</p><p>other small volume parenteral products, the total daily patient exposure to aluminum from the admixture should be</p><p>considered and maintained at no more than 5 mcg/kg/day <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Monitoring and Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Monitor fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count and</p><p>coagulation parameters throughout treatment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the prescribing information:</p><p>Adverse reactions with the use of cysteine hydrochloride injection were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Appropriate administration of ELCYS is not expected to cause major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or</p><p>fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with cysteine hydrochloride.</p><p>The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All</p><p>pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the</p><p>estimated background risk of major birth defect and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15</p><p>to 20%, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Data available on the effects of cysteine hydrochloride on infants, either directly or through breastmilk, do not suggest a</p><p>significant risk of adverse events from exposure. Although there are no data on the presence of cysteine hydrochloride in</p><p>human or animal milk or the effects on milk production, appropriate administration of ELCYS is not expected to cause</p><p>harm to a breastfed infant. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the</p><p>mother’s clinical need for ELCYS and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ELCYS or from the</p><p>underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">ELCYS is approved for use in pediatric patients, from birth to 17 years of age, for use as an additive to amino acid</p><p>solutions to meet the nutritional requirements of newborn infants, including preterm infants, requiring total parenteral</p><p>nutrition (TPN) and pediatric patients with severe liver disease who may have impaired enzymatic processes and require</p><p>TPN<span class="Italics">.</span> The safety profile for ELCYS use in pediatric patients includes risks of acid-base imbalance and hyperammonemia.</p><p>Acid-base imbalance, including metabolic acidosis, may occur with ELCYS administration in preterm infants. Frequent</p><p>clinical and laboratory assessments are necessary to monitor and manage fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and</p><p>acid-base balance during parenteral nutrition therapy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><p>Hyperammonemia is of special significance in infants (birth to two years of age). This reaction appears to be related to a</p><p>deficiency of the urea cycle amino acids of genetic or product origin. It is essential that blood ammonia be measured</p><p>frequently in infants <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].</span></p><p>Because of immature renal function, preterm infants receiving prolonged PN treatment with ELCYS may be at higher risk</p><p>of aluminum toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies with ELCYS have not been performed to determine whether patients aged 65 and over respond differently</p><p>from younger patients.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Monitor patients with impaired renal function receiving PN solutions containing the recommended dosage of ELCYS with</p><p>frequent clinical evaluation and laboratory tests to assess renal function, including serum electrolytes and fluid balance</p><p><span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Monitor patients with impaired liver function receiving PN solutions containing the recommended dosage of ELCYS with</p><p>frequent clinical evaluation and laboratory tests to assess liver function, such as bilirubin and liver function parameters</p><p><span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of over hydration or solute overload, re-evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures <span class="Italics">[see</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.7, 5.8)]</span>.</p><h2>Elcys Injection Description</h2><p class="First">ELCYS (cysteine hydrochloride injection) is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution for intravenous use. Each 10 mL of ELCYS</p><p>contains 500 mg of cysteine hydrochloride, USP (equivalent to 345 mg of cysteine) in water for injection. Sodium</p><p>hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid are used as needed to adjust the pH. The pH range is 1.0 to 2.5.</p><p>The active ingredient is cysteine hydrochloride. Cysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid. The chemical name of</p><p>cysteine hydrochloride is L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate and is chemically designated as C3H7NO2S • HCI • H2O</p><p>having a molecular weight of 175.63. Cysteine hydrochloride is a white crystalline powder soluble in water. Cysteine</p><p>aqueous solution is prone to oxidation when exposed to air, and when mixed with amino acids solutions, cysteine may</p><p>convert to insoluble cystine which leads to precipitation over time. It has the following structural formula:</p><p>ELCYS contains no more than 120 mcg/L of aluminum.</p><h2>Elcys Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Endogenous cysteine is synthesized from methionine by the enzyme, cystathionase, via the trans-sulfuration pathway, and</p><p>serves as a precursor substrate for both glutathione and taurine. ELCYS provides cysteine to the systemic circulation of</p><p>patients who require PN and cannot synthesize adequate quantities of cysteine due to insufficient or deficient</p><p>cystathionase activity.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">1.
