The vaccine is derived from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) produced through recombinant DNA techniques from yeast cells. The portion of the hepatitis B gene which codes for HBsAg is cloned into yeast which is then cultured to produce hepatitis B vaccine. </p><p>In immunocompetent people, Twinrix provides active immunization against hepatitis A virus infection (at an effective immune response rate &gt;99% of subjects) and against hepatitis B virus infection (at an effective immune response rate of 93% to 97%) 30 days after completion of the 3-dose series. This is comparable to using hepatitis A vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine concomitantly.</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>Seroconversion for antibodies against HAV and HBV were detected 1 month after completion of the 3-dose series.</p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>HAV and HBV seropositivity have been observed for 15 years in adults and for 10 years in children (Diaz-Mitoma 2008, Van Herck 2007).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Hepatitis A and B diseases prevention:</b> </p><p>Twinrix: Active immunization of persons 18 years and older (US labeling) or 19 years and older (Canadian labeling) against disease caused by hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus (all known subtypes) </p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Additional uses (not in US labeling): Approved for active immunization of children and adolescents ages 1 to 15 years.</p><p>Twinrix Junior [Canadian product]: Active immunization of children and adolescents ages 1 to 18 years against disease caused by hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus (all known subtypes).</p><p>Limitations of use: Hepatitis A/hepatitis B vaccine cannot be used for postexposure prophylaxis.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any hepatitis A–containing or hepatitis B–containing vaccine, or any component of the formulation, including yeast and neomycin.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Severe febrile illness. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note: Immunization during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: </b>Routine vaccination should NOT be delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic (CDC 2020; WHO 2020). In general, simultaneous administration of all vaccines for which a patient is eligible (according to current immunization schedules/guidelines) is recommended (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). However, outpatient visits solely for vaccination should be delayed in persons in quarantine due to close contact with COVID-19 or persons who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection (regardless of symptoms); refer to the CDC's "Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic" for current recommendations (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html).

Discard if the suspension is discolored, clear, or does not appear homogenous after shaking. Administer IM in the deltoid region; do not administer in the gluteal region (may give suboptimal response). Do not administer IV, intradermally, or SubQ (US labeling). Do not mix with other vaccines or injections; separate needles and syringes should be used for each injection. To prevent syncope-related injuries, patients should be vaccinated while seated or lying down (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). US law requires that the date of administration, the vaccine manufacturer, lot number of vaccine, Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) edition date and date it was provided, and the administering person's name, title, and address be recorded.</p><p>For patients at risk of hemorrhage following IM injection, the vaccine should be administered IM if, in the opinion of the physician familiar with the patient's bleeding risk, the vaccine can be administered by this route with reasonable safety. If the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered. A fine needle (23-gauge or smaller) should be used for the vaccination and firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. The patient should be instructed concerning the risk of hematoma from the injection. Patients on anticoagulant therapy should be considered to have the same bleeding risks and treated as those with clotting factor disorders (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). Although subcutaneous administration is not recommended in US labeling (antibody response may be suboptimal), the Canadian product labeling suggests that subcutaneous administration may be used in patients at risk for hemorrhage (including those with thrombocytopenia).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store in refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F); do not freeze (discard if frozen).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>There are no known significant interactions.</p><h2>Test Interactions</h2><p>Following vaccination, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), a component of the vaccine, has been transiently detected in blood samples. Therefore, serum HBsAg detection may not have diagnostic value within 28 days after receipt of hepatitis B vaccine.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Incidence of adverse effects of the combination product were similar to those occurring after administration of hepatitis A vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine alone.

Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever) unless they are at immediate risk of hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection; vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia); bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; if the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM injection can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). Canadian product labeling recommends subcutaneous administration for patients with thrombocytopenia or at risk for hemorrhage; however, antibody response may be suboptimal.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Anticoagulant therapy: Use with caution in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy; bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist. The use of combination vaccines is generally preferred over separate injections, taking into consideration provider assessment, patient preference, and potential adverse events. When using combination vaccines, the minimum age for administration is the oldest minimum age for any individual component; the minimum interval between dosing is the greatest minimum interval between any individual components. The ACIP prefers each dose of a specific vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer when possible; however, vaccination should not be deferred because a specific brand name is unavailable (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Consider deferring immunization during periods of severe immunosuppression (eg, patients receiving chemo/radiation therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy [including high-dose corticosteroids]); may have a reduced response to vaccination. In general, household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive all age-appropriate vaccines. Inactivated vaccines should be administered ≥2 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression when feasible; inactivated vaccines administered during chemotherapy should be readministered after immune competence is regained (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p>• Elderly: Patients &gt;60 years may have lower response rates to hepatitis B vaccine.</p><p>• Hemodialysis: Use with caution in patients undergoing hemodialysis; may not obtain adequate antibody titers following primary immunization.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Latex: Packaging may contain natural latex rubber.</p><p>• Yeast, neomycin, aluminum: May contain aluminum, yeast, and trace amounts of neomycin.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Use of this vaccine for specific medical and/or other indications (eg, immunocompromising conditions, hepatic or kidney disease, diabetes) is also addressed in the annual ACIP Recommended Immunization Schedules (refer to CDC schedule for detailed information). Specific recommendations for vaccination in immunocompromised patients with asplenia, cancer, HIV infection, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, cochlear implants, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (prior to or after), sickle cell disease, solid organ transplant (prior to or after), or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for chronic conditions as well as contacts of immunocompromised patients are available from the IDSA (Rubin 2014).</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and is improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). Due to the long incubation periods for hepatitis, unrecognized hepatitis A or B infection may be present; immunization may not prevent infection in these patients.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor for syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Based on data collected from a pregnancy registry between 2001 and 2015, an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage was not observed following maternal use of hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine.</p><p>Inactivated vaccines have not been shown to cause increased risks to the fetus (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). Refer to current immunization schedule for vaccinating pregnant females.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to prevent hepatitis A infection.</p><p>• It is used to prevent hepatitis B infection.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
