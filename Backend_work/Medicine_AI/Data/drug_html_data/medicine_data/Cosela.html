</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">For injection: Contains the equivalent of 300 mg of trilaciclib (provided as 349 mg of trilaciclib dihydrochloride) as a sterile, preservative-free, yellow, lyophilized cake in a single-dose vial for reconstitution and further dilution.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Cosela is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions to trilaciclib. Reactions have included anaphylaxis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Injection-Site Reactions, Including Phlebitis and Thrombophlebitis</h3><p class="First">Cosela administration can cause injection-site reactions including phlebitis and thrombophlebitis. Injection-site reactions including phlebitis and thrombophlebitis occurred in 56 (21%) of 272 patients receiving Cosela in clinical trials, including Grade 2 (10%) and Grade 3 (0.4%) adverse reactions (ARs). The median time to onset from start of Cosela was 15 days (range 1 to 542) and from the preceding dose of Cosela was 1 day (1 to 15).The median duration was 1 day (range 1 to 151 for the resolved cases). Injection-site reactions including phlebitis and thrombophlebitis resolved in 49 (88%) of the 56 patients and led to discontinuation of treatment in 3 (1%) of the 272 patients.</p><p>Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of injection-site reactions, phlebitis, and thrombophlebitis, including infusion-site pain and erythema during infusion. For mild (Grade 1) to moderate (Grade 2) injection-site reactions, flush line/cannula with at least 20 mL of sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP after end of infusion. For severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) injection-site reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue Cosela <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Acute Drug Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Cosela administration can cause acute drug hypersensitivity reactions, including facial edema and urticaria. Acute drug hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 16 (6%) of 272 patients receiving Cosela in clinical trials, including Grade 2 reactions (2%). One patient experienced a Grade 2 anaphylactic reaction 4 days after receiving Cosela, which resolved with epinephrine, and treatment with Cosela was continued. The median time to onset from start of Cosela was 77 days (range 2 to 256) and from the preceding dose of Cosela was 1 day (range 1 to 28). The median duration was 6 days (range 1 to 69 for the resolved cases). Acute drug hypersensitivity reactions resolved in 12 (75%) of the 16 patients.</p><p>Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of acute drug hypersensitivity reactions including facial, eye, and tongue edema, urticaria, pruritus, and anaphylactic reactions. For moderate (Grade 2) acute drug hypersensitivity reactions, stop infusion and hold Cosela until the adverse reaction recovers to Grade ≤1. For severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) acute drug hypersensitivity reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue Cosela <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis</h3><p class="First">Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) and/or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)4/6 inhibitors, the same drug class as Cosela. ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 1 (0.4%) of 272 patients receiving Cosela in clinical trials. The adverse reaction was Grade 3 and reported 2 months after discontinuing Cosela, in a patient receiving a confounding medication. The adverse reaction did not resolve.</p><p>Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis such as cough, dyspnea, and hypoxia. For recurrent moderate (Grade 2) ILD/pneumonitis, permanently discontinue Cosela. For severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) ILD/pneumonitis, permanently discontinue Cosela <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on its mechanism of action, Cosela can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Females of reproductive potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment with Cosela and for at least 3 weeks after the final dose <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the label:</p><ul class="Disc">

Therapeutic G-CSF, RBC, and platelet transfusions were allowed at any time during the studies as clinically indicated.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Underline">Study 1: Cosela Prior to Etoposide, Carboplatin, and Atezolizumab (E/P/A)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Patients with newly diagnosed ES-SCLC not previously treated with chemotherapy</span></p><p>Study 1 (G1T28-05) was a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Cosela or placebo administered prior to treatment with etoposide, carboplatin, and atezolizumab (E/P/A) for patients with newly diagnosed ES-SCLC not previously treated with chemotherapy.</p><p>A total of 107 patients were randomized to receive Cosela (n=54) or placebo (n=53) prior to administration of E/P/A; patients were stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 to 1 vs 2) and the presence of brain metastases. Carboplatin (AUC 5) and atezolizumab (1200 mg) were administered on Day 1 and etoposide (100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) and Cosela (240 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) or placebo were administered on Days 1, 2, and 3 of a 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 cycles (induction). After induction, maintenance atezolizumab (1200 mg) monotherapy on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cosela was not administered during maintenance.</p><p>The study population characteristics were: median age 64 years (range: 45 to 83); 70% male; 97% white; 14% ECOG performance status 2; 28% with a history of brain metastases; 38% current smokers; 46% lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt;ULN.</p><p>The mean relative dose intensities (RDIs) for E/P/A in patients receiving Cosela were 93%, 95%, and 93%, respectively. The mean RDIs for E/P/A in patients receiving placebo were 88%, 89%, and 91%, respectively. Dose reductions of carboplatin occurred in 2% of patients receiving Cosela and in 25% of patients receiving placebo; dose reductions of etoposide occurred in 6% of patients receiving Cosela and in 26% of patients receiving placebo. No dose reduction was allowed for Cosela or atezolizumab.</p><p>The study demonstrated a statistically significantly shorter duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in Cycle 1 (0 vs 4 days) and a lower proportion of patients with severe neutropenia (SN) (2% vs 49%) in patients receiving Cosela compared with placebo (Table 5). Nineteen percent of patients receiving Cosela had Grade 3 or 4 decreased hemoglobin compared with 28% of patients receiving placebo (adjusted relative risk 0.663 [95% CI: 0.336, 1.310]). The rate of RBC transfusions over time was 1.7/100 weeks for patients receiving Cosela and 2.6/100 weeks for patients receiving placebo (adjusted relative risk was not estimable). Six percent of patients receiving Cosela received erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) compared with 11% of patients receiving placebo (adjusted relative risk 0.529 [95% CI: 0.145, 1.927]).</p><p class="First Footnote">ANCOVA=analysis of covariance; CI=confidence interval; DSN=duration of severe neutropenia; G-CSF=granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; N=total number of patients in each treatment group; RBC=red blood cell; SD=standard deviation</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> The following statistical models were used to assess treatment effects: non-parametric ANCOVA (DSN in Cycle 1); modified Poisson regression (occurrence of SN and RBC transfusion on/after 5 weeks); negative binomial regression (number of all-cause dose reductions).
