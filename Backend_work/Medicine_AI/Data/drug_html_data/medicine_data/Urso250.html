However, ursodiol works only in those patients whose gallstones are made of cholesterol and works best when these stones are small and of the “floating” type. It is also used to help prevent gallstones in patients who are on rapid weight-loss programs.</p><p>Ursodiol is also used to treat primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). PBC is an autoimmune disorder that causes a patient's liver to have problems and not work properly.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Urso 250</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Urso 250</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain ursodiol.  It may not be specific to Urso 250. Please read with care.</b></p><p><i>Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.</p><p>It is best to take ursodiol with meals, unless otherwise directed by your doctor.</p><p><i>Take this medicine for the full time of treatment</i>, even if you begin to feel better. If you stop taking this medicine too soon, the gallstones may not dissolve as fast or may not dissolve at all.</p><p>It is thought that body weight and the kind of diet the patient follows may affect how fast the stones dissolve and whether new stones will form. However, check with your doctor before going on any diet.</p><p>If you are using <i>Urso Forte® tablets</i>:</p><ul>
<li>You may break the tablets into halves. To break the tablet easily, place it on a flat surface with the scored section on top. Hold the tablet with your thumbs placed close to the groove then apply gentle pressure until it breaks apart. Swallow each segment with water. Do not chew it.</li>
<li>Due to the bitter taste, store the half-tablets or segments separately from the whole tablets. Half-tablets can be used for up to 28 days when kept in the medicine bottle.</li>
