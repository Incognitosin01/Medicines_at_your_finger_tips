Hib infection usually affects children and can be fatal.</p><p>Haemophilus B conjugate (PRP-T) vaccine is used to prevent this disease in children, and is sometimes combined with vaccines to protect against other diseases. This vaccine is given to children between the ages of 2 months and 18 months old.</p><p>The vaccine works by exposing your child to a small amount of the bacteria or a protein from the bacteria, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body, and will not protect against other types of influenza.</p><p>Haemophilus B conjugate vaccine is <b>not</b> for use in children younger than 6 weeks. When used in combination with certain diphtheria vaccines, this vaccine may not be used in children younger than 15 months.</p><p>Like any vaccine, haemophilus B conjugate vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Your child should not receive this vaccine if he or she has ever had an allergic reaction to a haemophilus B or a tetanus vaccine.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Your child should not receive this vaccine if he or she has ever had an allergic reaction to a haemophilus B or meningococcal vaccine.</p><p>If your child has any of these other conditions, this vaccine may need to be postponed or not given at all:</p><ul>

In some cases, a 5th booster dose is given at 4 to 6 years of age.</p><p>Your child's individual booster schedule may be different from these guidelines, especially if the child does not start this series of shots before 7 months of age. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by the health department of the state you live in.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend treating fever and pain with an aspirin free pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, and others) when the shot is given and for the next 24 hours.
