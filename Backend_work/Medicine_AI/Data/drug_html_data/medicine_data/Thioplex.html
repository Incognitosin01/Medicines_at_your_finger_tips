</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Antineoplastic Agent</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Alkylating Agent</p><p>Chemical Class: Nitrogen Mustard</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Thioplex</h2><p>Thiotepa injection is used to lower risk of graft rejection when used with other medicines (eg, high-dose busulfan, cyclophosphamide) as a preparative regimen for stem cell transplantation in children with class 3 beta-thalassemia. It is also used to treat cancer of the breast, ovary, and urinary bladder. This medicine is also used to treat malignant effusions (accumulation of fluid in the body cavity) caused by cancer.</p><p>Thiotepa belongs to the group of medicines called alkylating agents. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by thiotepa, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects do not occur for months or years after the medicine is used.</p><p>This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Thioplex</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of thiotepa injection in children with class 3 beta-thalassemia. However, safety and efficacy of thiotepa injection to treat malignant effusions, breast, ovary, and urinary bladder cancer in children have not been established in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of thiotepa injection have not been performed in the geriatric population, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving thiotepa injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.
