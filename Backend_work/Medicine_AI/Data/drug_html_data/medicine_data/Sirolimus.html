Organ rejection happens when the immune system treats the new organ as an invader and attacks it.</p><p>Sirolimus is used with other medicines to prevent organ rejection after a kidney transplant.</p><p>Sirolimus is also given without other medicines to treat a rare lung disorder called lymphangioleiomyomatosis (lim-FAN-gee-oh-LYE-oh-MYE-oh-ma-TOE-sis). This disorder happens mostly in women and causes lung tumors that are not cancerous but can affect breathing.</p><p>Sirolimus may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use sirolimus if you have ever had a lung transplant or liver transplant.</p><p>Sirolimus may cause your body to overproduce white blood cells.
