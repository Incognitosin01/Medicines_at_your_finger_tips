This action blocks the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls and inhibits cell wall biosynthesis. Bacteria eventually lyse due to ongoing activity of cell wall autolytic enzymes (autolysis and murein hydrolases) while cell wall assembly is arrested. Ceftaroline has a strong affinity for PBP2a, a modified PBP in MRSA, and PBP2x in <i>S. pneumoniae</i>, contributing to its spectrum of activity against these bacteria.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p> V<sub>d</sub>: Median: 20.3 L (range: 18.3 to 21.6 L)</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Ceftaroline fosamil (inactive prodrug) undergoes rapid conversion to bioactive ceftaroline in plasma by phosphatase enzyme; ceftaroline is hydrolyzed to form inactive ceftaroline M-1 metabolite</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (~88%); feces (~6%)</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>~1 hour</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>1.6 ± 0.38 hours (single dose); 2.66 ± 0.4 hours (multiple dose)</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>~20%</p><h2>Special Populations: Renal Function Impairment</h2><p>AUC increased 52% in moderate renal impairment (CrCl &gt;30 to 50 mL/minute) and 115% in severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to 30 mL/minute) as compared to patients with normal renal function.

Reconstituted solution (400 mg vial = 20 mg/mL, 600 mg vial = 30 mg/mL) should be further diluted for IV administration in a compatible solution not to exceed a final concentration of 12 mg/mL. To prepare a 400 or 600 mg dose, withdraw 20 mL of diluent from 50 mL IV bag; inject the entire contents of the ceftaroline vial (also 20 mL) to achieve a total volume of 50 mL; resulting concentration is 12 mg/mL (600 mg vial) or 8 mg/mL (400 mg vial). Use the same solution as used for reconstitution (<b>Note:</b> If SWFI was used for reconstitution, then appropriate infusion solutions include NS, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>NS, D5W, D2.5W, or LR). Color of infusion solutions ranges from clear and light to dark yellow depending on concentration and storage conditions; potency is not affected.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IV: Administer by slow IV infusion over 5 to 60 minutes.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store unused vials at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F). Diluted solutions in D2.5W, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>NS, D5W, LR, or NS (in infusion bags or Mini-Bag Plus) should be used within 6 hours when stored at room temperature or within 24 hours if refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Aminoglycosides: Cephalosporins may enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Aminoglycosides.
