Aspirin belongs to a group of drugs called salicylates (sa-LIS-il-ates). It works by reducing substances in the body that cause pain, fever, and inflammation. Dipyridamole keeps platelets in your blood from sticking together to form clots.</p><p>Aggrenox is used to reduce the risk of stroke in people who have had blood clots or a "mini-stroke" (also called a transient ischemic attack or TIA).</p><p>Aggrenox is supplied as a capsule containing 200mg dipyridamole in extended-release pellets and a round white tablet incorporating immediate-release aspirin 25mg.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Aggrenox if you have asthma and also have polyps in your nose, or if you are allergic to aspirin or an NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug).</p><p><b>Aggrenox can increase your risk of bleeding, which can be severe or life-threatening.</b> Call your doctor or seek emergency medical attention if you have bleeding that will not stop, if you have black or bloody stools, or if you cough up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.</p><p>Do not use any other over-the-counter pain medication without first asking your doctor or pharmacist. Aspirin, salicylates, and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are contained in many medicines available over the counter. If you take certain products together you may accidentally take too much of a certain type of drug. Read the label of any other medicine you are using to see if it contains aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, magnesium and/or choline salicylate. Aspirin should not be given to a child or teenager who has a fever, especially if the child also has flu symptoms or chicken pox. Aspirin can cause a serious and sometimes fatal condition called Reye's syndrome in children.</p><p>Avoid drinking alcohol while you are taking Aggrenox. Alcohol may increase your risk of stomach bleeding. If you drink more than three alcoholic beverages per day, do not take Aggrenox without your doctor's advice.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Aggrenox if you are allergic to aspirin or dipyridamole, or if you have ever had:</p><ul>
