Zanamivir may also be given to prevent influenza in people who may be exposed but do not yet have symptoms. Zanamivir will not treat the common cold.</p><p>Zanamivir should not be used in place of getting a yearly flu shot. The Centers for Disease Control recommends an annual flu shot to help protect you each year from new strains of influenza virus.</p><p>Zanamivir may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Some people using zanamivir have had sudden unusual changes in mood or behavior, most often in children. It is not certain that zanamivir is the exact cause. Even without using zanamivir, anyone with influenza can have neurologic or behavioral effects that may lead to confusion or hallucinations. <b>Call your doctor right away if the person using  zanamivir has any signs of unusual thoughts or behavior.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use this medicine if you are allergic to zanamivir or to lactose (milk sugar).</p><p>Do not use zanamivir to <b>treat</b> flu symptoms in a child younger than 7 years old. Children as young as 5 years old may use zanamivir to <b>prevent</b> flu symptoms.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

<p>asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or any other chronic lung condition.</p>

However, getting sick with influenza during pregnancy can cause complications leading to birth defects, low birth weight, preterm delivery, or stillbirth. Your doctor will decide whether you should use zanamivir if you are pregnant.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that <b>pregnant women may receive a yearly flu vaccine to prevent influenza.</b> Zanamivir is not to be used in place of the yearly flu shot.</p><p>It may not be safe to breast-feed while using this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use zanamivir?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Start taking zanamivir as soon as possible after flu symptoms appear, such as fever, chills, muscle aches, sore throat, and runny or stuffy nose.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Zanamivir is packaged in disk-shaped foil packs that contain 4 blisters of medicine. These disks are placed into a device called a DISKHALER that you will use to inhale the medicine. The device opens and loads a blister of zanamivir each time you use the inhaler.</p><p>To treat flu symptoms: Use 2 inhalations twice per day for 5 days. On the first day of treatment, space your doses at least 2 hours apart. On the following days, space your doses at least 12 hours apart.</p><p>To prevent flu symptoms: Use 2 inhalations every 24 hours for 10 to 28 days. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Do not use a nebulizer or ventilator to give zanamivir. Zanamivir inhalation powder should never be mixed with a liquid.</p><p>If you are scheduled to use a bronchodilator at the same time as zanamivir, use the bronchodilator first.</p><p>Use  zanamivir for the full prescribed length of time, even if your symptoms quickly improve. Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve, or if they get worse.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Throw away the DISKHALER after your treatment ends.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Use the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if your next dose is due in less than 2 hours.
