HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis and may occur during treatment or after withdrawal of treatment. If HPA axis suppression occurs, an attempt to withdraw the drug, reduce the application frequency, or substitute a less potent corticosteroid. HPA suppression is usually reversible; if glucocorticoid insufficiency occurs, supplemental systemic steroids may be needed.</p><p>• Contact dermatitis: Allergic contact dermatitis can occur; it is usually diagnosed by failure to heal rather than clinical exacerbation. Further evaluation (eg, patch testing) may be necessary.</p><p>• Hypercalcemia/hypercalciuria: Use with caution in patients with known or suspected disorders of calcium metabolism; may cause transient increases in serum and urinary calcium (reversible); if hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria occurs, discontinue treatment until levels return to normal. The effects on calcium metabolism following treatment durations of longer than 4 weeks (ointment), 8 weeks (suspension), or 56 weeks (foam) have not been evaluated.</p><p>• Kaposi sarcoma: Prolonged treatment with corticosteroids has been associated with the development of Kaposi sarcoma (case reports); if noted, discontinuation of therapy should be considered (Goedert 2002).</p><p>• Local effects: Local adverse reactions may occur, including atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. These reactions are more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids; some reactions may be irreversible.</p><p>• Ocular effects: Glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataracts have been reported with topical corticosteroids; avoid contact with eyes and monitor for visual symptoms.</p><p>• Systemic effects: Topical corticosteroids may be absorbed percutaneously. Absorption of topical corticosteroids may cause manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, or glycosuria. Absorption is increased by the use of occlusive dressings, application to denuded skin, or application to large surface areas.</p><p><b><i>Disease related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Diabetes mellitus: Hyperglycemia and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus may result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids.</p><p>• Photosensitivity: Avoid excessive exposure of treated skin to natural or artificial sunlight (eg, tanning booths, sun lamps) and phototherapy.</p><p>• Skin infections: Use appropriate antibacterial or antifungal agents to treat concomitant skin infections; if infection persists, discontinue use of calcipotriene and betamethasone until infection has resolved.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Pediatric: Children may be at higher risk of systemic side effects due to a greater skin surface area:body weight ratio. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of corticosteroids after topical application and may be more prone to systemic effects. HPA axis suppression, intracranial hypertension, and Cushing syndrome have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Prolonged use may affect growth velocity and delay weight gain; growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Flammable contents: Foam contains flammable propellants. Avoid fire, flame, and smoking during and immediately following administration.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Do not use on the face, axillae, groin, or in the presence of preexisting skin atrophy at the treatment site. Not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use. Avoid exposure of suspension to the eyes; irritation may occur. Do not use occlusive dressings unless directed by a health care provider; discontinue use if irritation occurs.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Baseline serum calcium levels and then periodically during treatment in patients at risk for hypercalcemia</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>The treatment of psoriasis in pregnancy is initiated with conservative treatment as in nonpregnant females. When a topical steroid is needed, low to moderate potency corticosteroids are preferred initially, followed by moderate to high potency agents. High potency topical steroids should be used only when clearly needed and after the first trimester (Bae 2012). Information related to the use of calcipotriene in pregnancy has not been located (Bae 2012; Bangsgaard 2015); until additional information is available, some sources do not recommend use in pregnant females with psoriasis (Bae 2012), while others recommend limiting exposure to ≤50 g/week for ≤3 to 4 weeks) (Rademaker 2018).</p><p>Also refer to the Betamethasone (Topical) monograph for additional information.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat plaque psoriasis.</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
