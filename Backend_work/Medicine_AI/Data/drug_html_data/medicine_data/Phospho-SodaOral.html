Risk factors for developing acute phosphate nephropathy include increased age, hypovolemia, renal impairment, bowel obstruction, or active colitis. Use of medications that may impair renal perfusion or function may also increase risk. These include diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and possibly NSAIDs. However, cases have occurred in patients with no identifiable risk factors . OsmoPrep(R): Advise patients of the importance of following the recommended split dosage regimen and the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after the use of sodium phosphate, dibasic and sodium phosphate, monobasic. Avoid additional sodium phosphate-based purgative or enema products . Visicol(R): It is important to use the dose and dosing regimen as recommended (pm/am split dose)..</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

This medicine works by cleaning your colon and causing you to have diarrhea. This helps your doctor see the inside of your colon more clearly during the colonoscopy.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Phospho-Soda</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of OsmoPrep® tablets in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of OsmoPrep® tablets in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of OsmoPrep® tablets than younger adults, and are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution for patients receiving this medicine.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
