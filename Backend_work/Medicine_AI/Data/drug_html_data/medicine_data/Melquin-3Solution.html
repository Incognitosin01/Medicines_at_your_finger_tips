</ul><p class="First">(HYDROQUINONE 3% SKIN BLEACHING TOPICAL SOLUTION)</p><p><span class="Bold">Rx only</span></p><p>The Melquin-3 brand name has been discontinued in the U.S. If generic versions of this product have been approved by the FDA, there may be generic equivalents available.</p><h2>Melquin-3 Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Each mL of <span class="Bold">MELQUIN-3<span class="Sup">®</span> TOPICAL SOLUTION</span> contains <span class="Bold">ACTIVE:</span> Hydroquinone 3.0% (30 mg) <span class="Bold">INACTIVES:</span> SD Alcohol 40B (45% by volume), Purified Water, Isopropyl Alcohol(4% by volume), Propylene Glycol, Laureth-4, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose and Ascorbic Acid.</p><p>Hydroquinone is 1, 4-Benzenediol, with a chemical formula of C6H6O2 and a molecular weight of 110.11. The structural formula is:</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">C<span class="Sub">6</span>H<span class="Sub">6</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span></p><h2>Melquin-3 Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Topical application of hydroquinones produce a reversible depigmentation of the skin by the inhibition of the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine to 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) [Denton, C., et al , 1952 (1)] and suppression of other melanocyte metabolic processes [Jimbow, K., et al, 1974 (2)]. Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light will cause repigmentation of the bleached areas [Parrish, J., et al, 1978 (3)].</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Melquin-3 Solution</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">MELQUIN-3<span class="Sup">®</span> TOPICAL SOLUTION</span> is indicated for the temporary bleaching of hyperpigmented skin conditions such as chloasma, melasma, freckles, senile lentigines and other undesired areas of melanin hyperpigmentation.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">MELQUIN-3<span class="Sup">®</span> TOPICAL SOLUTION</span> is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to hydroquinone or any of the other ingredients. The safety of topical treatment of hydroquinone during pregnancy or in children (12 years and under) has not been established. (See PRECAUTIONS).</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">1. Hydroquinone is a skin bleaching agent which may produce undesired effects if not used as directed. The physician should be familiar with the contents of this insert before prescribing or dispensing this medication.</p><p>2. To evaluate possible susceptibility to irritation or sensitivity, each patient should begin by applying the medication to a small portion of unbroken skin at or near the pigmented area over a period of several days. Minor redness is not necessarily a contraindication, but treatment should be discontinued if itching, excessive inflammation or vesicle formation occurs. Use of <span class="Bold">MELQUIN-3<span class="Sup">®</span> TOPICAL SOLUTION</span> in paranasal and infraorbital areas increases the chance of irritations (See ADVERSE REACTIONS). If no improvement is seen after two months of treatment, use of this product should be discontinued.</p><p>3. There are no sunblocking or sunscreening agents in <span class="Bold">MELQUIN-3<span class="Sup">®</span> TOPICAL SOLUTION</span>. Sun exposure should be minimized by using a sunscreen agent, or protective clothing to cover bleached skin in order to prevent repigmentation from occuring. For daytime treatment use NUQUIN HP 4% CREAM, NUQUIN HP 4% GEL or MELPAQUE HP 4% CREAM.</p><p>4. Keep this and all other medications out of reach of children. In case of accidental ingestion, call a physician or a poison control center immediately.</p><p>5. Avoid contact with eyes. In case of accidental contact, patient should rinse eyes thoroughly with water and contact physician. A bitter taste and anesthetic effect may occur if applied to the lips.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(SEE WARNINGS)</span></p><h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hydroquinone. It is also not known whether hydroquinone can cause fetal harm when administered on a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. It is also not known to what degree, if any, topical hydroquinone is absorbed systemically. Topical hydroquinone should be used in pregnant women only when clearly indicated.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether topical administration of hydroquinone is absorbed or excreted in human milk. Caution is advised when topical hydroquinone is used by a nursing mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 years has not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">No systemic adverse reactions have been reported. Occasional hypersensitivity (localized contact dermatitis) may occur in which case the medication should be discontinued and the physician notified immediately.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There have been no systemic reactions reported from the use of topical hydroquinone treatment. However, treatment should be limited to relatively small areas of the body at one time since some patients may experience a transient skin reddening and a mild burning sensation which does not preclude treatment.</p><h2>Melquin-3 Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">MELQUIN-3<span class="Sup">®</span> TOPICAL SOLUTION</span> should be applied to affected areas twice daily, in the morning and before bedtime, or as directed by a physician. During the day, an effective broad spectrum sunscreen should be used and unnecessary solar exposure avoided. There is no recommended dosage for children under 12 years of age except under the advice and supervision of a physician. Keep container tightly closed. NOTE: Slight darkening of <span class="Bold">MELQUIN-3<span class="Sup">®</span> TOPICAL SOLUTION</span> is normal and does not affect potency of the product.</p><h2>How is Melquin-3 Solution Supplied</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">MELQUIN-3<span class="Sup">®</span> TOPICAL SOLUTION</span> (Hydroquinone 3%) is supplied in a 1 fl oz (29.57 mL) plastic bottle with applicator - NDC 58980-476-10</p><h3>STORAGE</h3><p class="First">Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F), excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (between 59°F and 86°F).
