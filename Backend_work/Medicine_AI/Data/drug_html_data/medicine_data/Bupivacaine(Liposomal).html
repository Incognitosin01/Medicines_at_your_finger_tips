General dosage guidance for bunionectomy and hemorrhoidectomy provided below:</p><p>Bunionectomy: 7 mL of undiluted bupivacaine (liposomal) infiltrated into the tissues surrounding the osteotomy and 1 mL of undiluted bupivacaine (liposomal) infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissue of the surgical site (total dose = 106 mg [8 mL])</p><p>Hemorrhoidectomy: 30 mL of diluted bupivacaine (liposomal) (20 mL diluted with 10 mL NS) divided and infiltrated as 6 injections of 5 mL each (total dose = 266 mg [20 mL]) around the anal sphincter.</p><p><b>Regional analgesia: </b>Interscalene brachial plexus nerve block: Single dose:</p><p>Total shoulder arthroplasty or rotator cuff repair: 133 mg (10 mL)</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Invert vial several times prior to withdrawing contents to resuspend particles. May dilute with NS or LR up to a final concentration of 0.89 mg/mL (ie, a 1:14 dilution by volume). Use only NS or LR for dilution; use of water or other hypotonic agents will disrupt liposomal particles. Do not admix with other local anesthetics (except for bupivacaine hydrochloride) or drugs. Bupivacaine hydrochloride may be mixed in the same syringe as bupivacaine (liposomal) as long as the milligram ratio of bupivacaine hydrochloride to bupivacaine (liposomal) does not exceed 1:2.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Administer undiluted or diluted. Inject slowly (1 to 2 mL per injection) into the surgical site using a ≥25 gauge needle with frequent aspiration prior to and during administration; do not filter. Do not administer epidurally, intrathecally, intravascularly, intra-articularly, or as a regional nerve block (except interscalene brachial plexus nerve block). Do not allow bupivacaine (liposomal) to come into contact with antiseptics (eg, povidone iodine) in solution; when a topical antiseptic is applied, allow site to dry prior to injection.</p><p>Non-bupivacaine-based local anesthetics may cause an immediate release of bupivacaine (liposomal) if administered together locally; therefore, <b>bupivacaine</b> should be administered no sooner than 20 minutes after injection of <b>lidocaine</b>. Do not administer other local anesthetics or other formulations of bupivacaine within 96 hours following bupivacaine (liposomal) administration; bupivacaine hydrochloride may be administered simultaneously in the same syringe or injected immediately before bupivacaine (liposomal) as long as the milligram ratio of bupivacaine hydrochloride to bupivacaine (liposomal) does not exceed 1:2.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store intact vials at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F); may also store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) for up to 30 days (do not re-refrigerate); do not heat or autoclave vials before use. Following withdrawal from the vial, store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) up to 4 hours prior to administration. Diluted suspensions must be used within 4 hours of preparation. Do not freeze or expose to high temperature (&gt;40°C [104°F]) for an extended period of time or administer if suspected of being frozen or exposed to high temperatures. Discard any unused portion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Bupivacaine: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Bupivacaine (Liposomal). Management: Bupivacaine may be administered immediately before, or administered in the same admixture syringe as liposomal bupivacaine as long as the ratio of the milligram dose of bupivacaine to liposomal bupivacaine does not exceed 1:2.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Hyaluronidase: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Local Anesthetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Lidocaine (Systemic): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Bupivacaine (Liposomal). Management: Liposomal bupivacaine should not be administered with topical lidocaine. Liposomal bupivacaine may be administered 20 minutes or more after the administration of lidocaine.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Local Anesthetics: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Bupivacaine (Liposomal). Management: Liposomal bupivacaine should not be administered with local anesthetics, but may be administered 20 minutes or more after lidocaine. Avoid all local anesthetics within 96 hours after administration of liposomal bupivacaine.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Local Anesthetics. Specifically, the risk for methemoglobinemia may be increased.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents: Local Anesthetics may enhance the neuromuscular-blocking effect of Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Technetium Tc 99m Tilmanocept: Local Anesthetics may diminish the diagnostic effect of Technetium Tc 99m Tilmanocept.

Additionally, use of local anesthetics have been associated with neurologic effects following infiltration of soft tissue (persistent anesthesia, paresthesia weakness, paralysis), which may be irreversible.</p><p>• CNS toxicity: Careful and constant monitoring of the patient's state of consciousness should be done following each local anesthetic injection; at such times, restlessness, anxiety, incoherent speech, lightheadedness, numbness and tingling of the mouth and lips, metallic taste, twitching, tinnitus, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, depression, or drowsiness may be early warning signs of CNS toxicity. Sensory and/or motor loss is temporary and varies and may last up to 5 days.</p><p>• Cardiovascular toxicity: Serious and fatal cardiovascular system reactions (eg, decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure, atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest) may occur with toxic concentrations.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Allergic-type reactions (eg, angioneurotic edema [including laryngeal edema], dizziness, elevated temperature, excessive sweating, nausea, syncope, tachycardia, pruritus, erythema, sneezing, urticaria, vomiting) and possibly anaphylactoid-like symptoms (including severe hypotension) have been reported (rare); cross-sensitivity among amide-type local anesthetics has been reported.</p><p>• Intra-articular infusion related chondrolysis: Continuous intra-articular infusion of local anesthetics after arthroscopic or other surgical procedures is not an approved use; chondrolysis (primarily in the shoulder joint) has occurred following infusion, with some cases requiring arthroplasty or shoulder replacement.</p><p>• Methemoglobinemia: Has been reported with local anesthetics; clinically significant methemoglobinemia requires immediate treatment along with discontinuation of the anesthetic and other oxidizing agents. Onset may be immediate or delayed (hours) after anesthetic exposure. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites, or infants &lt;6 months of age are more susceptible and should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia (eg, cyanosis, headache, rapid pulse, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, fatigue).</p><p>• Respiratory arrest: Local anesthetics have been associated with rare occurrences of sudden respiratory arrest.</p><p>• Seizures: Convulsions due to systemic toxicity leading to cardiac arrest have been reported with local anesthetics.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease; patients with impaired cardiovascular function are less able to compensate for functional changes associated with AV conduction prolongation produced by bupivacaine.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; patients with severe impairment may be at greater risk for toxicity.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; may be at greater risk for toxicity.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Avoid intravascular, epidural, intrathecal, intra-articular, and regional nerve block (except interscalene brachial plexus nerve block) injections. Not indicated for preincisional or preprocedural locoregional anesthetic techniques that require deep and complete sensory block. Do not administer other local anesthetics or other formulations of bupivacaine within 96 hours following bupivacaine (liposomal) administration. Aspiration should must be performed frequently prior to and during administration; the needle must be repositioned until no return of blood can be elicited by aspiration; however, absence of blood in the syringe does not guarantee that intravascular injection has been avoided.</p><p>• Product interchangeability: Bupivacaine hydrochloride is not bioequivalent to bupivacaine (liposomal); dosing conversion from bupivacaine hydrochloride to bupivacaine (liposomal) and vice versa is not possible.</p><p>• Trained personnel: Clinicians using local anesthetic agents should be well trained in diagnosis and management of emergencies that may arise from the use of these agents. Resuscitative equipment, oxygen, and other resuscitative drugs should be available for immediate use.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Cardiovascular and respiratory (adequacy of ventilation) vital signs, state of consciousness; signs of CNS toxicity, pain relief.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Bupivacaine crosses the placenta.</p><p>Following use of the nonliposomal formulation, small amounts of bupivacaine can be found in the maternal plasma, potentially causing varying degrees of maternal, fetal, and neonatal toxicity involving the CNS, peripheral vascular tone, and cardiac function.</p><p>Liposomal bupivacaine is approved for postsurgical local analgesia; studies have evaluated its use for intra-incisional blocks at the time of cesarean delivery to decrease postoperative pain (Parikh 2019; Prabhu 2018). Use of bupivacaine in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia is contraindicated (may cause fetal bradycardia and death).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to ease pain at the surgery site.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
