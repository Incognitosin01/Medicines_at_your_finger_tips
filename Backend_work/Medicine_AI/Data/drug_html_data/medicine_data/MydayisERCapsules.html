</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CNS stimulants, including MYDAYIS, other amphetamine-containing products, and methylphenidate, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 9.3), and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)].</span></span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Mydayis ER Capsules</h2><p class="First">MYDAYIS is indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in patients 13 years and older <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span></p><p>Pediatric patients 12 years and younger experienced higher plasma exposure than patients 13 years and older at the same dose, and experienced higher rates of adverse reactions, mainly insomnia and decreased appetite <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><h2>Mydayis ER Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Information Prior to Initiating Treatment</h3><p class="First">Prior to initiating treatment with MYDAYIS, assess for the presence of cardiac disease (e.g., a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p>Assess the risk of abuse, prior to prescribing and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy. Maintain careful prescription records, educate patients about abuse, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and periodically re-evaluate the need for MYDAYIS use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]</span>.</p><h3>General Instructions for Use</h3><p class="First">Because the effects of MYDAYIS may last up to 16 hours and there is potential for insomnia, administer once daily in the morning upon awakening. In the event of a missed dose, do not administer later in the day. Do not administer additional medication to make up for the missed dose <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><p>Pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for an extended period. Periodically re-evaluate the long-term use of MYDAYIS and adjust dosage as needed.</p><h3>Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Administer MYDAYIS orally with or without food. Advise patients to take MYDAYIS consistently either with food or without food <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>MYDAYIS may be administered in one of the following ways:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Swallow MYDAYIS capsules whole, or</li>
<li>Open capsule and sprinkle the entire contents over a spoonful of applesauce. The sprinkled applesauce should be consumed immediately; it should not be stored. Patients should take the sprinkled applesauce in its entirety without chewing.</li>
<li>The dose of a single capsule should not be divided.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing Information</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adult Use (18 to 55 years)</span></p><p>The recommended starting dose of MYDAYIS is 12.5 mg once daily in the morning upon awakening. Initial doses of 25 mg once daily may be considered for some patients. Dosage may be adjusted in increments of 12.5 mg no sooner than weekly, up to a maximum dose of 50 mg once daily, based on the therapeutic needs and response of the patient. Doses above 50 mg daily have shown no additional clinically meaningful benefit.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use (13 to 17 years)</span></p><p>The recommended starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily in the morning upon awakening. Dosage may be adjusted in increments of 12.5 mg no sooner than weekly, up to a recommended maximum dose of 25 mg once daily. The dose should be individualized according to the needs and response of the patient. Doses higher than 25 mg have not been evaluated in clinical trials in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Dosage Modifications due to Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Agents that alter gastrointestinal and urinary pH can impact urinary excretion and alter blood levels of amphetamine. Acidifying agents (e.g., ascorbic acid) decrease blood levels, while alkalinizing agents (e.g., sodium bicarbonate) increase blood levels. Adjust MYDAYIS dosage accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In adult patients with severe renal impairment (GFR between 15 to &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>), the recommended starting dose of MYDAYIS is 12.5 mg daily with a maximum recommended dose of 25 mg daily. MYDAYIS is not recommended for use in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD &lt; 15 ml/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>). In pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) with severe renal impairment, the maximum dose is 12.5 mg, if tolerated <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Switching from other Amphetamine Products</h3><p class="First">For patients switching from another medication or any other amphetamine products, discontinue that treatment, and titrate with MYDAYIS using the titration schedule <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><p>Do not substitute for other amphetamine products on a milligram-per-milligram basis because of different amphetamine base compositions and differing pharmacokinetic profiles <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Description (11), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><ul class="Disc">

<li>Known hypersensitivity to amphetamine, or other components of MYDAYIS. Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients treated with other amphetamine products <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</li>
<li>Concomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and also within 14 days following discontinuation of treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, because of an increased risk of hypertensive crisis <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Potential for Abuse and Dependence</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants, including MYDAYIS, other amphetamine-containing products, and methylphenidate, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Serious Cardiovascular Reactions</h3><p class="First">Sudden death, stroke and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults with CNS stimulant treatment at recommended doses. Sudden death has been reported in pediatric patients with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems while taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, and other serious heart problems. Further evaluate patients who develop exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or arrhythmias during MYDAYIS treatment.</p><h3>Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase about 2-4 mm Hg) and heart rate (mean increase about 3-6 bpm). Monitor all patients for potential tachycardia and hypertension <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Psychiatric Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Exacerbation of Pre-existing Psychosis</span></p><p>CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder</span></p><p>CNS stimulants may induce a mixed/manic episode in patients with bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms</span></p><p>CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing MYDAYIS. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% in placebo-treated patients.</p><h3>Long-Term Suppression of Growth</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants, including MYDAYIS. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial of MYDAYIS in patients ages 6 to 17 years old with ADHD, there was a decrease in weight in the MYDAYIS groups compared to weight gain in the placebo group <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>Patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. MYDAYIS is not approved for use in pediatric patients 12 years and younger <span class="Italics">[Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><h3>Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's Phenomenon</h3><p class="First">Stimulants, including MYDAYIS, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">MYDAYIS may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizure, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in the absence of seizures, and in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, MYDAYIS should be discontinued.</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span> The co-administration with cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitors may also increase the risk with increased exposure to MYDAYIS. In these situations, consider an alternative non-serotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><p>Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).</p><p>Concomitant use of MYDAYIS with MAOI drugs is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p>Discontinue treatment with MYDAYIS and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of MYDAYIS with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors is clinically warranted, initiate MYDAYIS with lower doses, monitor patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome during drug initiation or titration, and inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome.</p><h3>Potential for Overdose Due to Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between MYDAYIS and other amphetamine products could occur, leading to possible overdosage. To avoid substitution errors and overdosage, do not substitute for other amphetamine products on a milligram-per-milligram basis because of different amphetamine base compositions and differing pharmacokinetic profiles <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>MYDAYIS was studied in adults (18 to 55 years) and pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4<span class="Sup">th</span> or 5<span class="Sup">th</span> editions (DSM-IV-TR<span class="Sup">® or</span> DSM-5) criteria for ADHD. The safety data for adults were pooled from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg per day (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). Doses higher than 50 mg per day did not demonstrate additional clinical benefit and are not recommended.</p><p>The safety data for pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) is from 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of doses of 12.5 mg to 25 mg. The total exposure in patients treated with MYDAYIS totalled 704; this included pediatric patients, 78 adolescent patients and 626 adult patients from multiple well-controlled trials. The duration of use ranged from 4 to 7 weeks <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment</span></p><p>In pooled controlled trials of adult patients, 9% (54/626) of MYDAYIS-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 2% (7/328) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation (i.e. leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of MYDAYIS-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were insomnia (2%, n=15), blood pressure increased (2%, n=10), decreased appetite (1%, n=5), and headache (1%, n= 4).</p><p>In a controlled trial including adolescent patients (13 to 17 years), 5% (4/78) of MYDAYIS-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 0% (0/79) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation (i.e. leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of MYDAYIS-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were dizziness (1%, n=1), depression (1%, n=1), abdominal pain upper (1%, n=1), and viral infection (1%, n=1).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of ≥2% and at Least Twice Placebo Among MYDAYIS-Treated Adults in Clinical Trials</span></p><p>The most common adverse reactions reported in adults were insomnia, decreased appetite, dry mouth, decreased weight, heart rate increased, and anxiety. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred ≥2% compared to placebo. The most common adverse reaction (insomnia) generally occurred early during treatment with MYDAYIS.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or more and at Least Twice Placebo Among MYDAYIS-Treated Adolescents (13 to 17 years) in a 4-week Clinical Trial</span></p><p>The most common adverse reactions reported in adolescents were decreased appetite, nausea, insomnia, abdominal pain upper, irritability, and weight decreased. Table 2 lists the adverse reactions that occurred ≥2% compared to placebo.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions Associated with the Use of Amphetamines</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been associated with the use of amphetamines. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of amphetamines. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular</span>: Dyspnea, sudden death. There have been isolated reports of cardiomyopathy associated with chronic amphetamine use.</p><p><span class="Bold">Central Nervous System</span>: Psychotic episodes at recommended doses, overstimulation, restlessness, euphoria, dyskinesia, dysphoria, headache, tics, fatigue, aggression, anger, logorrhea, dermatillomania, and paresthesia (including formication).</p><p><span class="Bold">Eye Disorders:</span> Mydriasis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal</span>: Unpleasant taste, constipation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Allergic</span>: Urticaria, rash, hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis. Serious skin rashes, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported.</p><p><span class="Bold">Endocrine</span>: Impotence, changes in libido, frequent or prolonged erections.</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin</span>: Alopecia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Vascular Disorders</span>: Raynaud's phenomenon.</p><p><span class="Bold">Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders</span>: Rhabdomyolysis.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with Amphetamines</h3><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">Amphetamines can cause a significant elevation in plasma corticosteroid levels. This increase is greatest in the evening. Amphetamines may interfere with urinary steroid determinations.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Exposure Registry</span></p><p>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to MYDAYIS during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>The limited available data from published literature and postmarketing reports on use of amphetamine in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Adverse pregnancy outcomes, including premature delivery and low birth weight, have been seen in infants born to mothers dependent on amphetamines <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Considerations]</span>.</p><p>In an embryofetal development study, amphetamine (<span class="Italics">d-</span> to <span class="Italics">l-</span> enantiomer ratio of 3:1, the same as in MYDAYIS) had no effects on embryofetal morphological development or survival when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis up to doses 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 25 mg/day given to adolescents, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area basis. However, in a pre- and post-natal development study, amphetamine (<span class="Italics">d-</span> to <span class="Italics">l-</span> ratio of 3:1) administered orally to pregnant rats during gestation and lactation caused a decrease in pup survival and a decrease in pup body weight that correlated with a delay in developmental landmarks at clinically relevant doses of amphetamine. In addition, adverse effects on reproductive performance were observed in pups whose mothers were treated with amphetamine. Long-term neurochemical and behavioral effects have also been reported in animal developmental studies using clinically relevant doses of amphetamine <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15- 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Amphetamines, such as MYDAYIS, cause vasoconstriction and thereby may decrease placental perfusion. In addition, amphetamines can stimulate uterine contractions increasing the risk of premature delivery. Infants born to amphetamine-dependent mothers have an increased risk of premature delivery and low birth weight.</p><p>Monitor infants born to mothers taking amphetamines for symptoms of withdrawal such as feeding difficulties, irritability, agitation, and excessive drowsiness.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Amphetamine (<span class="Italics">d-</span> to <span class="Italics">l-</span> enantiomer ratio of 3:1, the same as in MYDAYIS) had no apparent effects on embryofetal morphological development or survival when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis at doses of up to 6 and 16 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are approximately 2 and 10 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 25 mg/day given to adolescents, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area basis. Fetal malformations and death have been reported in mice following parenteral administration of <span class="Italics">d</span>-amphetamine doses of 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) or greater to pregnant animals. Administration of these doses was also associated with severe maternal toxicity.</p><p>A pre- and postnatal development study was conducted with amphetamine (<span class="Italics">d-</span> to <span class="Italics">l-</span> enantiomer ratio of 3:1) in which pregnant rats received daily oral doses of 2, 6, and 10 mg/kg from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20. These doses are approximately 0.6, 2, and 3 times the MRHD of 25 mg/day amphetamine (<span class="Italics">d-</span> to <span class="Italics">l-</span> ratio of 3:1) given to adolescents, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. All doses caused hyperactivity and decreased weight gain in the dams. A decrease in pup survival was seen at all doses. A decrease in pup body weight was seen at 6 and 10 mg/kg which correlated with delays in developmental landmarks, such as preputial separation and vaginal opening. Increased pup locomotor activity was seen at 10 mg/kg on day 22 postpartum but not at 5 weeks postweaning. When pups were tested for reproductive performance at maturation, gestational weight gain, number of implantations, and number of delivered pups were decreased in the group whose mothers had been given 10 mg/kg.</p><p>A number of studies from the literature in rodents indicate that prenatal or early postnatal exposure to amphetamine (<span class="Italics">d-</span> or <span class="Italics">d, l-</span>) at doses similar to those used clinically can result in long-term neurochemical and behavioral alterations. Reported behavioral effects include learning and memory deficits, altered locomotor activity, and changes in sexual function.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Based on limited case reports in published literature, amphetamine (<span class="Italics">d-</span> or <span class="Italics">d, l-</span>) is present in human milk, at relative infant doses of 2% to 13.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 1.9 and 7.5. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant. Long-term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from amphetamine exposure are unknown. It is possible that large dosages of dextroamphetamine might interfere with milk production, especially in women whose lactation is not well established. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, including serious cardiovascular reactions, blood pressure and heart rate increase, suppression of growth, and peripheral vasculopathy, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with MYDAYIS.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of MYDAYIS in pediatric patients with ADHD ages 13 to 17 years have been established in two placebo-controlled clinical studies <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>Safety and effectiveness of MYDAYIS have not been established in pediatric patients ages 12 years and younger.</p><p>MYDAYIS has been studied for the treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years in two placebo controlled safety and efficacy trials. In the first trial, pediatric patients 6 to 12 years experienced higher rates of adverse reactions in some cases compared to patients 13 years and older, including higher rates of insomnia (30% versus 8%) and appetite decreased (43% versus 22%). In addition, amphetamine systemic exposures (both <span class="Italics">d</span>- and <span class="Italics">l</span>-) in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years following a single dose were higher than those observed in adults at the same dose (72-79% higher C<span class="Sub">max</span> and approximately 83% higher AUC). A second trial evaluated a lower dose than those approved for pediatric patients 13 to 17 years; efficacy was not demonstrated for the lower dose. Therefore, a safe and effective dose cannot be established in pediatric patients 12 years and younger.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Growth Suppression</span></p><p>Growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, including MYDAYIS, in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data</span></p><p>Juvenile rats treated with mixed amphetamine salts (same as in MYDAYIS) early in the postnatal period through sexual maturation demonstrated transient changes in motor activity. Learning and memory was impaired at approximately 8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) given to children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. No recovery was seen following a drug free period. A delay in sexual maturation was observed at a dose approximately 8 times the MRHD given to children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, although there was no effect on fertility.</p><p>In a juvenile developmental study, rats received daily oral doses of amphetamine (<span class="Italics">d</span> to <span class="Italics">l</span> enantiomer ratio of 3:1, the same as in MYDAYIS) of 2, 6, or 20 mg/kg on days 7-13 of age; from day 14 to approximately day 60 of age these doses were given b.i.d. for total daily doses of 4, 12, or 40 mg/kg. The latter doses are approximately 0.8, 2, and 8 times the MRHD of 25 mg/day given to children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Post-dosing hyperactivity was seen at all doses; motor activity measured prior to the daily dose was decreased during the dosing period but the decreased motor activity was largely absent after an 18 day drug-free recovery period. Performance in the Morris water maze test for learning and memory was impaired at the 40 mg/kg dose, and sporadically at the lower doses, when measured prior to the daily dose during the treatment period; no recovery was seen after a 19 day drug-free period. A delay in the developmental milestones of vaginal opening and preputial separation was seen at 40 mg/kg but there was no effect on fertility.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of MYDAYIS did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Due to reduced clearance of amphetamine in patients with severe renal insufficiency (GFR 15 to &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>), the maximum dose in adults should be reduced. Pediatric patients ages 13 to 17 years with severe renal insufficiency can be given the recommended starting dose if tolerated, but the dose should not be escalated.

Abuse is characterized by impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of amphetamine abuse may include increased heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and/or sweating, dilated pupils, hyperactivity, restlessness, insomnia, decreased appetite, loss of coordination, tremors, flushed skin, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been seen. Abusers of amphetamine may use unapproved routes of administration which can result in overdose and death <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><p>To reduce the abuse of CNS stimulants, including MYDAYIS, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, keep careful prescription records, educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal of CNS stimulants. Monitor for signs of abuse while on therapy, and re-evaluate the need for MYDAYIS use.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tolerance</span></p><p>Tolerance (a state of adaptation in which exposure to a specific dose of a drug results in a reduction of the drug's desired and/or undesired effects over time, in such a way that a higher dose of the drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose) may occur during the chronic therapy of CNS stimulants including MYDAYIS.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dependence</span></p><p>Physical dependence (a state of adaptation manifested by a withdrawal syndrome produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, or administration of an antagonist) may occur in patients treated with CNS stimulants including MYDAYIS. Withdrawal symptoms after abrupt cessation of CNS stimulants include extreme fatigue and depression.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Consult with a Certified Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) for up-to-date guidance and advice for treatment of overdosage. Individual patient response to amphetamines varies widely. Toxic symptoms may occur idiosyncratically at low doses.</p><p>Manifestations of amphetamine overdose include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, panic states, hyperpyrexia, and rhabdomyolysis. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central nervous system stimulation. Other reactions include arrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension, circulatory collapse, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Fatal poisoning is usually preceded by convulsions and coma.</p><p>The prolonged release of mixed amphetamine salts from MYDAYIS should be considered when treating patients with overdose.</p><p>D-amphetamine is not dialyzable.</p><h2>Mydayis ER Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">MYDAYIS extended-release capsules contain mixed salts of a single-entity amphetamine, a CNS stimulant. MYDAYIS contains equal amounts (by weight) of four salts: dextroamphetamine sulfate and amphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate and amphetamine aspartate monohydrate. This results in a 3:1 mixture of dextro- to levo- amphetamine base equivalent.</p><p>The 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg and 50 mg strength capsules are for oral administration. They contain three types of drug-releasing beads, an immediate release and two different types of delayed release (DR) beads. The first DR bead releases amphetamine at pH 5.5 and the other DR bead releases amphetamine at pH 7.0.</p><p class="First">Inactive Ingredients and Colors: The inactive ingredients in MYDAYIS capsules include: hard gelatin capsules, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, methacrylic acid copolymer, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, methacrylic acid copolymer, opadry beige, sugar spheres, talc, and triethyl citrate. The gelatin capsules for all four strengths contain gelatin, titanium dioxide, yellow iron oxide, and edible inks. The 12.5 mg and 25 mg strength gelatin capsules also contain FD&amp;C Blue #2. The 37.5 mg strength also contains red iron oxide. The 50 mg strength capsule also contains D&amp;C Red #28, D&amp;C Red #33, and FD&amp;C Blue #1.</p><h2>Mydayis ER Capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Amphetamines are non-catecholamine sympathomimetic amines with CNS stimulant activity. The exact mode of therapeutic action in ADHD is not known.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Amphetamines block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">MYDAYIS contains <span class="Italics">d-</span>amphetamine and <span class="Italics">l-</span>amphetamine salts in the ratio of 3:1. Pharmacokinetic studies of <span class="Italics">d-</span> and <span class="Italics">l-</span>amphetamine after oral administration of MYDAYIS have been conducted in healthy adults (19 to 52 years) and pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) with ADHD. Following administration of MYDAYIS, the peak plasma concentrations occurred in about 7 – 10 hours in pediatric patients and about 8 hours in adults for both d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine. The mean plasma elimination half-life for d- amphetamine ranges from about 10 – 11 hours and l-amphetamine from 10 – 13 hours in both pediatric and adult patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>MYDAYIS exhibits linear dose proportionality over the range of 12.5 to 50 mg. Steady-state is achieved between Days 7 and 8 of dosing with mean accumulation ratio of 1.6. A single dose of MYDAYIS 37.5 mg capsules provided comparable plasma concentration profiles of both <span class="Italics">d-</span> and <span class="Italics">l-</span>amphetamine to mixed amphetamine salts extended release (MAS-ER) 25 mg followed by 12.5 mg immediate release amphetamine administered 8 hours later (Figure 1).</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1 Mean Plasma Concentrations of d- and l-amphetamine Following Oral Administration of MYDAYIS 37.5 mg vs MAS-ER 25 mg Followed by Immediate-Release MAS-IR 12.5 mg 8 Hours Later in Adults</span></p><p></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Effect of Food</span></p><p>High fat meal does not affect the extent of absorption of <span class="Italics">d-</span> and <span class="Italics">l-</span>amphetamine when taken with MYDAYIS.

Opening the capsule and sprinkling the contents on applesauce results in comparable absorption and exposure to the intact capsule taken in the fasted state <span class="Italics">[see Dosing and Administration (2.3)]</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Effect of Alcohol</span></p><p>The <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> testing showed increases in amphetamine release rate from MYDAYIS capsules in the presence of 20% and, more noticeably, 40% alcohol. There is no <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> study conducted for the effect of alcohol on drug exposure.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Amphetamine is reported to be oxidized at the 4 position of the benzene ring to form 4-hydroxyamphetamine, or on the side chain <span class="Italics">α</span> or <span class="Italics">β</span> carbons to form alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine or norephedrine, respectively. Norephedrine and 4-hydroxy-amphetamine are both active and each is subsequently oxidized to form 4-hydroxy-norephedrine. Alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine undergoes deamination to form phenylacetone, which ultimately forms benzoic acid and its glucuronide and the glycine conjugate hippuric acid. Although the enzymes involved in amphetamine metabolism have not yet been clearly defined, CYP2D6 is known to be involved with formation of 4-hydroxy-aphetamine. Since CYP2D6 is genetically polymorphic, population variations in amphetamine metabolism are a possibility.</p><p>Amphetamine is known to inhibit monoamine oxidase. Amphetamines are not an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> inhibitor of the major human CYP450 isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4), nor was it an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4/5. Amphetamines are not an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> substrate for P-gp.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>The renal excretion is the primary route for elimination of <span class="Italics">d</span>- and <span class="Italics">l</span>-amphetamine and its metabolites after administration of MYDAYIS.</p><p>At normal urine pHs, approximately half of an administered dose of amphetamine is recoverable in urine as derivatives of alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine and approximately another 30%-40% of the dose is recoverable in urine as amphetamine itself. Urinary recovery of amphetamine is highly dependent on pH and urine flow rates. Alkaline urine pHs result in less ionization and reduced renal elimination, and acidic pHs and high flow rates result in increased renal elimination. Urinary recovery of amphetamine has been reported to range from 1% to 75%, and the fraction of a dose hepatically metabolized is dependent on urine pH. Consequently, both hepatic and renal dysfunctions have the potential to alter the elimination of amphetamine and could result in prolonged exposures <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Age</span></p><p>Comparison of the pharmacokinetics of <span class="Italics">d</span>- and <span class="Italics">l</span>-amphetamine after oral administration of MYDAYIS in pediatric patients with ADHD 13 to 17 years old and healthy adult subjects (19 to 52 years) indicates that body weight is the primary determinant of apparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of <span class="Italics">d-</span> and <span class="Italics">l-</span>amphetamine across the age range.</p><p>PK data from patients age 13 to 17 years (n=14) who received a single 25 mg MYDAYIS capsule was scaled (based on PK proportionality) and compared with PK data from adult patients 19 to 51 years (n =20) who received 37.5 mg.
