</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Qudexy XR Capsules</h2><h3>Monotherapy Epilepsy</h3><p class="First">QUDEXY XR is indicated as initial monotherapy for the treatment of partial-onset or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 2 years of age and older.</p><h3>Adjunctive Therapy Epilepsy</h3><p class="First">QUDEXY XR is indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older.</p><h3>Migraine</h3><p class="First">QUDEXY XR is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in patients 12 years of age and older.</p><h2>Qudexy XR Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosing in Monotherapy Epilepsy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults and Pediatric Patients 10 Years of Age and Older</span></p><p>The recommended dose for QUDEXY XR monotherapy in adults and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older is 400 mg orally once daily. Titrate QUDEXY XR according to the following schedule (see Table 1).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients 2 to 9 Years of Age</span></p><p>Dosing in patients 2 to 9 years of age is based on weight. During the titration period, the initial dose of QUDEXY XR is 25 mg/day nightly for the first week. Based upon tolerability, the dosage can be increased to 50 mg/day in the second week. Dosage can be increased by 25 mg to 50 mg once daily each subsequent week, as tolerated. Titration to the minimum maintenance dose should be attempted over 5 to 7 weeks. Based upon tolerability and clinical response, additional titration to a higher dose (up to the maximum maintenance dose) can be attempted at 25 mg to 50 mg once daily weekly increments. The total daily dose should not exceed the maximum maintenance dose for each range of body weight (see Table 2).</p><h3>Dosing in Adjunctive Therapy Epilepsy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults (17 Years of Age and Older)</span></p><p>The recommended total daily dose of QUDEXY XR as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures or Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome is 200 mg to 400 mg orally once daily, and with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures is 400 mg orally once daily. Initiate therapy at 25 mg to 50 mg once daily followed by titration to an effective dose in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg every week. Titrating in increments of 25 mg/day every week may delay the time to reach an effective dose. Doses above 400 mg/day have not been shown to improve responses in adults with partial-onset seizures.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients 2 to 16 Years of Age</span></p><p>The recommended total daily dose of QUDEXY XR as adjunctive therapy for pediatric patients 2 to 16 years of age with partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is approximately 5 mg/kg to 9 mg/kg orally once daily. Begin titration at 25 mg once daily (or less, based on a range of 1 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day) given nightly for the first week. Subsequently, increase the dosage at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 1 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day to achieve optimal clinical response. Dose titration should be guided by clinical outcome. The total daily dose should not exceed 400 mg/day.</p><h3>Dosing for the Preventive Treatment of Migraine</h3><p class="First">The recommended total daily dose of QUDEXY XR as treatment for the preventive treatment of migraine in patients 12 years of age and older is 100 mg once daily. The recommended titration rate for QUDEXY XR for the preventive treatment of migraine is as follows:</p><p>Dose and titration rate should be guided by clinical outcome. If required, longer intervals between dose adjustment can be used.</p><h3>Dose Modifications in Patients With Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>), one-half of the usual adult dose of Qudexy XR is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Dosage in Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis</h3><p class="First">To avoid rapid drops in topiramate plasma concentration during hemodialysis, a supplemental dose of Qudexy XR may be required. The actual adjustment should take into account 1) the duration of dialysis period, 2) the clearance rate of the dialysis system being used, and 3) the effective renal clearance of topiramate in the patient being dialyzed <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Qudexy XR Capsules may be swallowed whole or may be administered by carefully opening the capsule and sprinkling the entire contents on a small amount (teaspoon) of soft food. This drug/food mixture should be swallowed immediately and not chewed or crushed. It should not be stored for further use. QUDEXY XR can be taken without regard to meals <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">QUDEXY XR (topiramate) extended-release capsules are available in the following strengths and colors:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle Closure Glaucoma</h3><p class="First">A syndrome consisting of acute myopia associated with secondary angle closure glaucoma has been reported in patients receiving topiramate. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity and/or ocular pain. Ophthalmologic findings can include myopia, anterior chamber shallowing, ocular hyperemia (redness) and increased intraocular pressure. Mydriasis may or may not be present. This syndrome may be associated with supraciliary effusion resulting in anterior displacement of the lens and iris, with secondary angle closure glaucoma. Symptoms typically occur within 1 month of initiating topiramate therapy. In contrast to primary narrow angle glaucoma, which is rare under 40 years of age, secondary angle closure glaucoma associated with topiramate has been reported in pediatric patients as well as adults. The primary treatment to reverse symptoms is discontinuation of QUDEXY XR as rapidly as possible, according to the judgment of the treating physician. Other measures, in conjunction with discontinuation of QUDEXY XR, may be helpful.</p><p>Elevated intraocular pressure of any etiology, if left untreated, can lead to serious sequelae including permanent vision loss.</p><h3>Visual Field Defects</h3><p class="First">Visual field defects (independent of elevated intraocular pressure) have been reported in patients receiving topiramate independent of elevated intraocular pressure. In clinical trials, most of these events were reversible after topiramate discontinuation. If visual problems occur at any time during treatment with topiramate, consideration should be given to discontinuing the drug.</p><h3>Oligohydrosis and Hyperthermia</h3><p class="First">Oligohydrosis (decreased sweating), resulting in hospitalization in some cases, has been reported in association with topiramate use. Decreased sweating and an elevation in body temperature above normal characterized these cases. Some of the cases were reported after exposure to elevated environmental temperatures.</p><p>The majority of the reports have been in pediatric patients. Patients, especially pediatric patients, treated with QUDEXY XR should be monitored closely for evidence of decreased sweating and increased body temperature, especially in hot weather. Caution should be used when QUDEXY XR is prescribed with other drugs that predispose patients to heat-related disorders; these drugs include, but are not limited to, other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and drugs with anticholinergic activity.</p><h3>Metabolic Acidosis</h3><p class="First">QUDEXY XR can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by QUDEXY XR. QUDEXY XR-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild to moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of QUDEXY XR.</p><p>Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with immediate-release topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for immediate-release topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value &lt; 17 mEq/L and &gt;5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.</p><p>Manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis may include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis and may also result in osteomalacia (referred to as rickets in pediatric patients) and/or osteoporosis with an increased risk for fractures <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]</span>. Chronic metabolic acidosis in pediatric patients may also reduce growth rates, which may decrease the maximal height achieved. The effect of topiramate on growth and bone-related sequelae has not been systematically investigated in long-term, placebo-controlled trials. Long-term, open-label treatment of pediatric patients 1 to 24 months old, with intractable partial epilepsy, for up to 1 year, showed reductions from baseline in length, weight, and head circumference compared to age and sex-matched normative data, although these patients with epilepsy are likely to have different growth rates than normal 1 to 24-month-old patients. Reductions in length and weight were correlated to the degree of acidosis <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>. QUDEXY XR treatment that causes metabolic acidosis during pregnancy can possibly produce adverse effects on the fetus and might also cause metabolic acidosis in the neonate from possible transfer of topiramate to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Measurement of Serum Bicarbonate in Epilepsy and Migraine Patients</span></p><p>Measurement of baseline and periodic serum bicarbonate during QUDEXY XR treatment is recommended. If metabolic acidosis develops and persists, consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing QUDEXY XR (using dose tapering). If the decision is made to continue patients on QUDEXY XR in the face of persistent acidosis, alkali treatment should be considered.</p><h3>Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</h3><p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including QUDEXY XR increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p><p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p><p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p><p>Table 4 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p><p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.</p><p>Anyone considering prescribing QUDEXY XR or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p><h3>Cognitive/Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Immediate-release topiramate can cause cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions and therefore these are expected to be caused by QUDEXY XR. The most frequent of these can be classified into three general categories: 1) Cognitive-related dysfunction (e.g., confusion, psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration/attention, difficulty with memory, speech or language problems, particularly word-finding difficulties); 2) Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (e.g., depression or mood problems); and 3) Somnolence or fatigue.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adult Patients</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Cognitive Related Dysfunction</span></p><p>Rapid titration rate and higher initial dose were associated with higher incidences of cognitive-related dysfunction.</p><p>In adult epilepsy adjunctive controlled trials, which used rapid titration (100 to 200 mg/day weekly increments) and target immediate-release topiramate doses of 200 mg to 1000 mg/day, 56% of patients in the 800 mg/day and 1000 mg/day dose groups experienced cognitive-related dysfunction compared to approximately 42% of patients in the 200 to 400 mg/day groups and 14% for placebo. In this rapid titration regimen, these dose-related adverse reactions began in the titration or in the maintenance phase, and in some patients these events began during titration and persisted into the maintenance phase.</p><p>In the monotherapy epilepsy-controlled trial conducted with immediate-release topiramate, the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for topiramate 50 mg per day and 26% for 400 mg per day.</p><p>In the 6-month controlled trials for the preventive treatment of migraine, which used a slower titration regimen (25 mg/day weekly increments), the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for topiramate 50 mg/day, 22% for 100 mg/day (the recommended dose), 28% for 200 mg/day, and 10% for placebo. Cognitive adverse reactions most commonly developed during titration and sometimes persisted after completion of titration.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Psychiatric/Behavioral Disturbances</span></p><p>Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (e.g., depression or mood) were dose-related for both the adjunctive epilepsy and migraine populations treated with topiramate <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Somnolence/Fatigue</span></p><p>Somnolence and fatigue were the adverse reactions most frequently reported during clinical trials of topiramate for adjunctive epilepsy. For the adjunctive epilepsy population, the incidence of fatigue appeared dose-related. For the monotherapy epilepsy population, the incidence of somnolence was dose-related. For the migraine population, the incidences of both somnolence and fatigue were dose-related and more common in the titration phase.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>In pediatric epilepsy trials (adjunctive and monotherapy), the incidence of cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was generally lower than that observed in adults. These reactions included psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration/attention, speech disorders/related speech problems, and language problems. The most frequently reported cognitive/neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric epilepsy patients during adjunctive therapy double-blind studies were somnolence and fatigue. The most frequently reported cognitive/neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric epilepsy patients in the 50 mg/day and 400 mg/day groups during the monotherapy double-blind study were headache, dizziness, anorexia, and somnolence.</p><p>In pediatric migraine patients, the incidence of cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was increased in topiramate-treated patients compared to placebo.</p><p>The risk for cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was dose-dependent and was greatest at the highest dose (200 mg). This risk for cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was also greater in younger patients (6 to 11 years of age) than in older patients (12 to 17 years of age). The most common cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reaction in these trials was difficulty with concentration/attention. Cognitive adverse reactions most commonly developed during the titration period and sometimes persisted for various durations after completion of titration.</p><p>The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) was administered to adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) to assess the effects of topiramate on cognitive function at baseline and at the end of the Study 13 <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.5)]</span>. Mean change from baseline in certain CANTAB tests suggests that topiramate treatment may result in psychomotor slowing and decreased verbal fluency.</p><h3>Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">QUDEXY XR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Data from pregnancy registries indicate that infants exposed to topiramate <span class="Italics">in utero</span> have an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts) and for being small for gestational age. When multiple species of pregnant animals received topiramate at clinically relevant doses, structural malformations, including craniofacial defects, and reduced fetal weights occurred in offspring <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p>Consider the benefits and risks of QUDEXY XR when administering the drug in women of childbearing potential, particularly when QUDEXY XR is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>. QUDEXY XR should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to a fetus <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs</h3><p class="First">In patients with or without a history of seizures or epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs including QUDEXY XR, should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential for seizures or increased seizure frequency <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. In situations where, rapid withdrawal of QUDEXY XR is medically required, appropriate monitoring is recommended.</p><h3>Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy Without and With Concomitant Valproic Acid Use</h3><p class="First">Topiramate treatment can cause hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. The risk for hyperammonemia with topiramate appears dose-related. Hyperammonemia has been reported more frequently when topiramate is used concomitantly with valproic acid. Post-marketing cases of hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy have been reported with topiramate and valproic acid in patients who previously tolerated either drug alone <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><p>Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy and/or vomiting. In most cases, hyperammonemic encephalopathy abated with discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>The incidence of hyperammonemia in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in the preventive treatment of migraine trials was 26% in patients taking topiramate monotherapy at 100 mg/day, and 14% in patients taking topiramate at 50 mg/day, compared to 9% in patients taking placebo. There was also an increased incidence of markedly increased hyperammonemia at the 100 mg dose.</p><p>Dose-related hyperammonemia was also seen in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months of age treated with topiramate and concomitant valproic acid for partial-onset epilepsy and this was not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction.</p><p>In some patients, hyperammonemia can be asymptomatic.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Monitoring for Hyperammonemia</span></p><p>Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, topiramate treatment or an interaction of concomitant topiramate and valproic acid treatment may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons.</p><p>In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status associated with any topiramate treatment, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured.</p><h3>Kidney Stones</h3><p class="First">Topiramate increases the risk of kidney stones. During adjunctive epilepsy trials, the risk for kidney stones in immediate-release topiramate-treated adults was 1.5%, an incidence about 2 to 4 times greater than expected in a similar, untreated population. As in the general population, the incidence of stone formation among topiramate-treated patients was higher in men. Kidney stones have also been reported in pediatric patients taking topiramate for epilepsy or migraine. During long-term (up to 1 year) topiramate treatment in an open-label extension study of 284 pediatric patients 1 to 24 months old with epilepsy, 7% developed kidney or bladder stones. QUDEXY XR is not approved for treatment of epilepsy in pediatric patients less than 2 years old <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><p>Topiramate is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can promote stone formation by reducing urinary citrate excretion and by increasing urinary pH <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>. The concomitant use of QUDEXY XR with any other drug producing metabolic acidosis, or potentially in patients on a ketogenic diet, may create a physiological environment that increases the risk of kidney stone formation, and should therefore be avoided.</p><p>Increased fluid intake increases the urinary output, lowering the concentration of substances involved in stone formation. Hydration is recommended to reduce new stone formation.</p><h3>Hypothermia With Concomitant Valproic Acid Use</h3><p class="First">Hypothermia, defined as a drop-in body core temperature to &lt;35°C (95°F), has been reported in association with topiramate use with concomitant valproic acid both in conjunction with hyperammonemia and in the absence of hyperammonemia. This adverse reaction in patients using concomitant topiramate and valproate can occur after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>. Consideration should be given to stopping QUDEXY XR or valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

The most common (≥ 2% more frequent than low-dose 50 mg/day topiramate) adverse reactions causing discontinuation were difficulty with memory, fatigue, asthenia, insomnia, somnolence, and paresthesia.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients 6 to 15 Years of Age</span></p><p>The most common adverse reactions in the controlled trial (Study 1) that occurred in pediatric patients in the 400 mg/day topiramate group and at an incidence higher (≥ 10%) than in the 50 mg/day group were fever and weight loss (see Table 5).</p><p>Approximately 14% of the 77 pediatric patients in the 400 mg/day group who received topiramate as monotherapy in the controlled clinical trial discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. The most common (≥ 2% more frequent than in the 50 mg/day group) adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation in this trial were difficulty with concentration/attention, fever, flushing, and confusion.</p><p>Table 5 represents the incidence of adverse reactions occurring in at least 3% of the adult and pediatric patients treated with 400 mg/day immediate-release topiramate and occurring with greater incidence than 50 mg/day topiramate.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adjunctive Therapy Epilepsy</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adults 16 Years of Age and Older</span></p><p>In pooled controlled clinical trials in adults with partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 183 patients received adjunctive therapy with immediate-release topiramate at dosages of 200 to 400 mg/day (recommended dosage range) and 291 patients received placebo. Patients in these trials were receiving 1 to 2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs in addition to immediate-release topiramate or placebo.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial that occurred in adult patients in the 200 to 400 mg/day topiramate group with an incidence higher (≥ 10%) than in the placebo group were: dizziness, speech disorders/related speech problems, somnolence, nervousness, psychomotor slowing, and vision abnormal (Table 6).</p><p>Table 6 presents the incidence of adverse reactions occurring in at least 3% of adult patients treated with 200 to 400 mg/day topiramate and was greater than placebo incidence.

The clinical consequences were not severe in most cases, but deaths have been reported after overdoses involving topiramate.</p><p>Topiramate overdose has resulted in severe metabolic acidosis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><p>A patient who ingested a dose of immediate-release topiramate between 96 g and 110 g was admitted to a hospital with a coma lasting 20 to 24 hours followed by full recovery after 3 to 4 days.</p><p>Similar signs, symptoms, and clinical consequences are expected to occur with overdosage of QUDEXY XR.

QUDEXY XR (topiramate) extended-release capsules are available as 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg capsules for oral administration as whole capsules or opened and sprinkled onto a spoonful of soft food.</p><p>Topiramate is a white to off-white powder. Topiramate is freely soluble in polar organic solvents such as acetonitrile and acetone; and very slightly soluble to practically insoluble in non-polar organic solvents such as hexanes. Topiramate has the molecular formula C<span class="Sub">12</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>NO<span class="Sub">8</span>S and a molecular weight of 339.4.

Electrophysiological and biochemical evidence suggests that topiramate, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels, augments the activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyrate at some subtypes of the GABA-A receptor, antagonizes the AMPA/kainate subtype of the glutamate receptor, and inhibits the carbonic anhydrase enzyme, particularly isozymes II and IV.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Topiramate has anticonvulsant activity in rat and mouse maximal electroshock seizure (MES) tests. Topiramate is only weakly effective in blocking clonic seizures induced by the GABA-A receptor antagonist, pentylenetetrazole. Topiramate is also effective in rodent models of epilepsy, which include tonic and absence-like seizures in the spontaneous epileptic rat (SER) and tonic and clonic seizures induced in rats by kindling of the amygdala or by global ischemia.</p><p>Changes (increases and decreases) from baseline in vital signs (systolic blood pressure-SBP, diastolic blood pressure-DBP, pulse) occurred more frequently in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) treated with various daily doses of topiramate (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 2 to 3 mg/kg) than in patients treated with placebo in controlled trials for the preventive treatment of migraine. The most notable changes were SBP &lt; 90 mm Hg, DBP &lt; 50 mm Hg, SBP or DBP increases or decreases ≥ 20 mm Hg, and pulse increases or decreases ≥ 30 beats per minute. These changes were often dose-related and were most frequently associated with the greatest treatment difference at the 200 mg dose level. Systematic collection of orthostatic vital signs has not been conducted. The clinical significance of these various changes in vital signs has not been clearly established.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption and Distribution</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of QUDEXY XR are linear with dose proportional increases in plasma concentration when administered as a single oral dose over the range of 50 mg to 1,400 mg. At 25 mg, the pharmacokinetics of QUDEXY XR are nonlinear, possibly due to the binding of topiramate to carbonic anhydrase in red blood cells.</p><p>QUDEXY XR sprinkled on a spoonful of soft food is bioequivalent to the intact capsule formulation.</p><p>Following a single 200 mg oral dose of QUDEXY XR, peak plasma concentrations (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) occurred approximately 20 hours after dosing. Steady-state was reached in about 5 days following daily dosing of QUDEXY XR in subjects with normal renal function, with a T<span class="Sub">max</span> of approximately 6 hours.</p><p>At steady-state, the plasma exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">0–24hr</span>, C<span class="Sub">max</span>, and C<span class="Sub">min</span>) of topiramate from QUDEXY XR administered once daily and the immediate-release topiramate tablets administered twice-daily were shown to be bioequivalent. Fluctuation of topiramate plasma concentrations at steady-state for QUDEXY XR administered once daily was approximately 40% in healthy subjects, compared to approximately 53% for immediate-release topiramate <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)]</span>.</p><p>Compared to the fasted state, high-fat meal had no effect on bioavailability (AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) but delayed the T<span class="Sub">max</span> by approximately 4 hours following a single dose of QUDEXY XR. QUDEXY XR can be taken without regard to meals.</p><p>Topiramate is 15% to 41% bound to human plasma proteins over the blood concentration range of 0.5 mcg/mL to 250 mcg/mL. The fraction bound decreased as blood concentration increased.</p><p>Carbamazepine and phenytoin do not alter the binding of immediate-release topiramate. Sodium valproate, at 500 mcg/mL (a concentration 5 to 10 times higher than considered therapeutic for valproate) decreased the protein binding of immediate-release topiramate from 23% to 13%. Immediate-release topiramate does not influence the binding of sodium valproate.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Excretion</span></p><p>Topiramate is not extensively metabolized and is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine (approximately 70% of an administered dose). Six metabolites have been identified in humans, none of which constitutes more than 5% of an administered dose. The metabolites are formed via hydroxylation, hydrolysis, and glucuronidation. There is evidence of renal tubular reabsorption of topiramate. In rats, given probenecid to inhibit tubular reabsorption, along with topiramate, a significant increase in renal clearance of topiramate was observed. This interaction has not been evaluated in humans. Overall, oral plasma clearance (CL/F) is approximately 20 mL/min to 30 mL/min in adults following oral administration. The mean effective half-life of QUDEXY XR is approximately 56 hours.

Patients with a history of cluster headaches or basilar, ophthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches were excluded from the trials. Patients were required to have completed up to a 2-week washout of any prior migraine preventive medications before starting the baseline phase.</p><p>Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine headaches over the 4 weeks in the baseline phase were randomized to either topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day (twice the recommended daily dosage for the preventive treatment of migraine), or placebo and treated for a total of 26 weeks (8-week titration period and 18-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily).</p><p>Effectiveness of treatment was assessed by the reduction in migraine headache frequency, as measured by the change in 4-week migraine rate (according to migraines classified by IHS criteria) from the baseline phase to double-blind treatment period in each immediate-release topiramate treatment group compared to placebo in the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population.</p><p>In Study 11, a total of 469 patients (416 females, 53 males), ranging in age from 13 to 70 years, were randomized and provided efficacy data. Two hundred sixty-five patients completed the entire 26-week double-blind phase.

Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily). Approximately 80% or more patients in each treatment group completed the study. The median average daily dosages were 45 and 79 mg/day in the target dose groups of immediate-release topiramate 50 and 100 mg/day, respectively.</p><p>Effectiveness of treatment was assessed by comparing each immediate-release topiramate treatment group to placebo (ITT population) for the percent reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in the monthly migraine attack rate (primary endpoint). The percent reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in average monthly migraine attack rate is shown in Table 15.
