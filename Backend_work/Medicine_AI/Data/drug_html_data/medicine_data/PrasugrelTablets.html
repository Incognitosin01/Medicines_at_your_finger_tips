</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Prasugrel Tablets</h2><h3>Acute Coronary Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Prasugrel Tablets are indicated to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular (CV) events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are to be managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as follows:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Patients with unstable angina (UA) or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).</li>
<li>Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) when managed with primary or delayed PCI.</li>
</ul><p>Prasugrel has been shown to reduce the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke compared to clopidogrel. The difference between treatments was driven predominantly by MI, with no difference on strokes and little difference on CV death <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies ( 14)]</span> .</p><h2>Prasugrel Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Initiate prasugrel treatment as a single 60-mg oral loading dose and then continue at 10-mg orally once daily. Patients taking prasugrel should also take aspirin (75-mg to 325-mg) daily <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions ( 7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]</span> . Prasugrel tablet may be administered with or without food <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) and Clinical Studies ( 14)]</span> .</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Timing of Loading Dose</span></p><p>In the clinical trial that established the efficacy and safety of prasugrel, the loading dose of prasugrel was not administered until coronary anatomy was established in UA/NSTEMI patients and in STEMI patients presenting more than 12 hours after symptom onset. In STEMI patients presenting within 12 hours of symptom onset, the loading dose of prasugrel was administered at the time of diagnosis, although most received prasugrel at the time of PCI <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies ( 14)]</span> . For the small fraction of patients that required urgent CABG after treatment with prasugrel, the risk of significant bleeding was substantial.</p><p>Although it is generally recommended that antiplatelet therapy be administered promptly in the management of ACS because many cardiovascular events occur within hours of initial presentation, in a trial of 4033 NSTEMI patients, no clear benefit was observed when prasugrel loading dose was administered prior to diagnostic coronary angiography compared to at the time of PCI; however, risk of bleeding was increased with early administration in patients undergoing PCI or early CABG.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dosing in Low Weight Patients</span></p><p>Compared to patients weighing ≥60 kg, patients weighing &lt;60 kg have an increased exposure to the active metabolite of prasugrel and an increased risk of bleeding on a 10-mg once daily maintenance dose. Consider lowering the maintenance dose to 5-mg in patients &lt;60 kg. The effectiveness and safety of the 5-mg dose have not been prospectively studied <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]</span> .</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Prasugrel Tablets 5 mg are available as pink round shaped film-coated tablets, debossed "S77" on one side and blank on the other side.</p><p>Prasugrel Tablets 10 mg are available as pink long hexagonal shaped film-coated tablets, debossed "L1" on one side and blank on the other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Active Bleeding</h3><p class="First">Prasugrel tablet is contraindicated in patients with active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]</span> .</p><h3>Prior Transient Ischemic Attack or Stroke</h3><p class="First">Prasugrel tablet is contraindicated in patients with a history of prior transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. In TRITON-TIMI 38 ( <span class="Bold">TR</span>ial to Assess <span class="Bold">I</span>mprovement in <span class="Bold">T</span>herapeutic Outcomes by <span class="Bold">O</span>ptimizing Platelet Inhibitio <span class="Bold">N</span> with Prasugrel), patients with a history of TIA or ischemic stroke (&gt;3 months prior to enrollment) had a higher rate of stroke on prasugrel (6.5%; of which 4.2% were thrombotic stroke and 2.3% were intracranial hemorrhage [ICH]) than on clopidogrel (1.2%; all thrombotic). In patients without such a history, the incidence of stroke was 0.9% (0.2% ICH) and 1.0% (0.3% ICH) with prasugrel and clopidogrel, respectively. Patients with a history of ischemic stroke within 3 months of screening and patients with a history of hemorrhagic stroke at any time were excluded from TRITON-TIMI 38. Patients who experience a stroke or TIA while on prasugrel generally should have therapy discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1) and Clinical Studies ( 14)]</span> .</p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Prasugrel tablet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to prasugrel or any component of the product <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2)]</span> .</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>General Risk of Bleeding</h3><p class="First">Thienopyridines, including prasugrel, increase the risk of bleeding. With the dosing regimens used in TRITON-TIMI 38, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Major (clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin ≥5 g/dL, or intracranial hemorrhage) and TIMI Minor (overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of ≥3 g/dL but &lt;5 g/dL) bleeding events were more common on prasugrel than on clopidogrel <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]</span> . The bleeding risk is highest initially, as shown in Figure 1 (events through 450 days; inset shows events through 7 days).</p><p></p><p>Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures even if the patient does not have overt signs of bleeding.</p><p>Do not use Prasugrel Tablets in patients with active bleeding, prior TIA or stroke <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications ( 4.1, 4.2)]</span> .</p><p>Other risk factors for bleeding are:</p><ul>
<li>Age ≥75 years. Because of the risk of bleeding (including fatal bleeding) and uncertain effectiveness in patients ≥75 years of age, use of prasugrel is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3), and Clinical Trials ( 14)]</span> .</li>
<li>CABG or other surgical procedure <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)]</span> .</li>
<li>Body weight &lt;60 kg. Consider a lower (5-mg) maintenance dose <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1), and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6)]</span> .</li>
<li>Propensity to bleed (e.g., recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, active peptic ulcer disease, severe hepatic impairment, or moderate to severe renal impairment) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7, 8.8)]</span> .</li>
<li>Medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., oral anticoagulants, chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and fibrinolytic agents). Aspirin and heparin were commonly used in TRITON-TIMI 38 <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions ( 7.1, 7.2. 7.4), and Clinical Studies ( 14)]</span> .</li>
</ul><p>Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7-10 days), so withholding a dose will not be useful in managing a bleeding event or the risk of bleeding associated with an invasive procedure. Because the half-life of prasugrel's active metabolite is short relative to the lifetime of the platelet, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 6 hours of the loading dose or 4 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.</p><h3>Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery-Related Bleeding</h3><p class="First">The risk of bleeding is increased in patients receiving prasugrel who undergo CABG. If possible, prasugrel should be discontinued at least 7 days prior to CABG.</p><p>Of the 437 patients who underwent CABG during TRITON-TIMI 38, the rates of CABG-related TIMI Major or Minor bleeding were 14.1% in the prasugrel group and 4.5% in the clopidogrel group <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]</span> . The higher risk for bleeding events in patients treated with prasugrel persisted up to 7 days from the most recent dose of study drug. For patients receiving a thienopyridine within 3 days prior to CABG, the frequencies of TIMI Major or Minor bleeding were 26.7% (12 of 45 patients) in the prasugrel group, compared with 5.0% (3 of 60 patients) in the clopidogrel group. For patients who received their last dose of thienopyridine within 4 to 7 days prior to CABG, the frequencies decreased to 11.3% (9 of 80 patients) in the prasugrel group and 3.4% (3 of 89 patients) in the clopidogrel group.</p><p>Do not start prasugrel in patients likely to undergo urgent CABG. CABG-related bleeding may be treated with transfusion of blood products, including packed red blood cells and platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 6 hours of the loading dose or 4 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.</p><h3>Discontinuation of Prasugrel Tablets</h3><p class="First">Discontinue thienopyridines, including prasugrel, for active bleeding, elective surgery, stroke, or TIA. The optimal duration of thienopyridine therapy is unknown. In patients who are managed with PCI and stent placement, premature discontinuation of any antiplatelet medication, including thienopyridines, conveys an increased risk of stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and death. Patients who require premature discontinuation of a thienopyridine will be at increased risk for cardiac events. Lapses in therapy should be avoided, and if thienopyridines must be temporarily discontinued because of an adverse event(s), they should be restarted as soon as possible <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications ( 4.1, 4.2) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]</span> .</p><h3>Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura</h3><p class="First">Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has been reported with the use of prasugrel. TTP can occur after a brief exposure (&lt;2 weeks). TTP is a serious condition that can be fatal and requires urgent treatment, including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). TTP is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes [fragment red blood cells] seen on peripheral smear), neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2)]</span> .</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Including Angioedema</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity including angioedema has been reported in patients receiving prasugrel, including patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to other thienopyridines <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications ( 4.3) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2)]</span> .</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1, 5.2)]</span></li>
<li>Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)]</span></li>
<li>Hypersensitivity Including Angioedema <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Safety in patients with ACS undergoing PCI was evaluated in a clopidogrel-controlled study, TRITON-TIMI 38, in which 6741 patients were treated with prasugrel (60-mg loading dose and 10-mg once daily) for a median of 14.5 months (5802 patients were treated for over 6 months; 4136 patients were treated for more than 1 year). The population treated with prasugrel was 27 to 96 years of age, 25% female, and 92% Caucasian. All patients in the TRITON-TIMI 38 study were to receive aspirin. The dose of clopidogrel in this study was a 300-mg loading dose and 75-mg once daily.</p><p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials cannot be directly compared with the rates observed in other clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Discontinuation</span></p><p>The rate of study drug discontinuation because of adverse reactions was 7.2% for prasugrel and 6.3% for clopidogrel. Bleeding was the most common adverse reaction leading to study drug discontinuation for both drugs (2.5% for prasugrel and 1.4% for clopidogrel).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Bleeding</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Bleeding Unrelated to CABG Surgery</span> - In TRITON-TIMI 38, overall rates of TIMI Major or Minor bleeding adverse reactions unrelated to coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) were significantly higher on prasugrel than on clopidogrel, as shown in Table 1.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> Patients may be counted in more than one row.<br/>
<span class="Sup">b</span> See 5.1 for definition.</p><p>Figure 1 demonstrates non-CABG related TIMI Major or Minor bleeding.

The rate of CABG-related TIMI Major or Minor bleeding was 14.1% for the prasugrel group and 4.5% in the clopidogrel group ( <span class="Italics">see</span> Table 3). The higher risk for bleeding adverse reactions in patients treated with prasugrel persisted up to 7 days from the most recent dose of study drug.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> Patients may be counted in more than one row.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Bleeding Reported as Adverse Reactions</span> - Hemorrhagic events reported as adverse reactions in TRITON-TIMI 38 were, for prasugrel and clopidogrel, respectively: epistaxis (6.2%, 3.3%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (1.5%, 1.0%), hemoptysis (0.6%, 0.5%), subcutaneous hematoma (0.5%, 0.2%), post-procedural hemorrhage (0.5%, 0.2%), retroperitoneal hemorrhage (0.3%, 0.2%), pericardial effusion/hemorrhage/tamponade (0.3%, 0.2%), and retinal hemorrhage (0.0%, 0.1%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Malignancies</span></p><p>During TRITON-TIMI 38, newly-diagnosed malignancies were reported in 1.6% and 1.2% of patients treated with prasugrel and clopidogrel, respectively. The sites contributing to the differences were primarily colon and lung. In another Phase 3 clinical study of ACS patients not undergoing PCI, in which data for malignancies were prospectively collected, newly-diagnosed malignancies were reported in 1.8% and 1.7% of patients treated with prasugrel and clopidogrel, respectively. The site of malignancies was balanced between treatment groups except for colorectal malignancies. The rates of colorectal malignancies were 0.3% prasugrel, 0.1% clopidogrel and most were detected during investigation of GI bleed or anemia. It is unclear if these observations are causally-related, are the result of increased detection because of bleeding, or are random occurrences.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Other Adverse Events</span></p><p>In TRITON-TIMI 38, common and other important non-hemorrhagic adverse events were, for prasugrel and clopidogrel, respectively: severe thrombocytopenia (0.06%, 0.04%), anemia (2.2%, 2.0%), abnormal hepatic function (0.22%, 0.27%), allergic reactions (0.36%, 0.36%), and angioedema (0.06%, 0.04%). Table 4 summarizes the adverse events reported by at least 2.5% of patients.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of prasugrel. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Blood and lymphatic system disorders</span></span> — Thrombocytopenia, Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17)]</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Immune system disorders</span></span> — Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications ( 4.3)]</span></p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Warfarin</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of prasugrel and warfarin increases the risk of bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of prasugrel and NSAIDs (used chronically) may increase the risk of bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]</span> .</p><h3>Opioids</h3><p class="First">As with other oral P2Y <span class="Sub">12</span> inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of prasugrel's active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]</span> . Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists.</p><h3>Other Concomitant Medications</h3><p class="First">Prasugrel can be administered with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]</span> .</p><p>Prasugrel can be administered with aspirin (75-mg to 325-mg per day), heparin, GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, statins, digoxin, and drugs that elevate gastric pH, including proton pump inhibitors and H <span class="Sub">2</span> blockers <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]</span> .</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data with prasugrel use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. No structural malformations were observed in animal reproductive and developmental toxicology studies when rats and rabbits were administered prasugrel during organogenesis at doses of up to 30 times the recommended therapeutic exposures in humans <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span> . Due to the mechanism of action of prasugrel, and the associated identified risk of bleeding, consider the benefits and risks of prasugrel and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing prasugrel to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1, 5.3)]</span> .</p><p>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. The background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2-4% and of miscarriage is 15-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In embryo fetal developmental toxicology studies, pregnant rats and rabbits received prasugrel at maternally toxic oral doses equivalent to more than 40 times the human exposure. A slight decrease in fetal body weight was observed; but, there were no structural malformations in either species. In prenatal and postnatal rat studies, maternal treatment with prasugrel had no effect on the behavioral or reproductive development of the offspring at doses greater than 150 times the human exposure.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of prasugrel in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Metabolites of prasugrel were found in rat milk <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span> .

However, due to Eli Lilly and Company’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In TRITON-TIMI 38, 38.5% of patients were ≥65 years of age and 13.2% were ≥75 years of age. The risk of bleeding increased with advancing age in both treatment groups, although the relative risk of bleeding (prasugrel compared with clopidogrel) was similar across age groups.</p><p>Patients ≥75 years of age who received prasugrel 10-mg had an increased risk of fatal bleeding events (1.0%) compared to patients who received clopidogrel (0.1%). In patients ≥75 years of age, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 7 patients (0.8%) who received prasugrel and in 3 patients (0.3%) who received clopidogrel. Because of the risk of bleeding, and because effectiveness is uncertain in patients ≥75 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies ( 14)]</span> , use of prasugrel is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (diabetes and past history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3), and Clinical Studies ( 14)]</span> .</p><h3>Low Body Weight</h3><p class="First">In TRITON-TIMI 38, 4.6% of patients treated with prasugrel had body weight &lt;60 kg. Individuals with body weight &lt;60 kg had an increased risk of bleeding and an increased exposure to the active metabolite of prasugrel <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]</span> . Consider lowering the maintenance dose to 5-mg in patients &lt;60 kg. The effectiveness and safety of the 5-mg dose have not been prospectively studied <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. There is limited experience in patients with end-stage renal disease, but such patients are generally at higher risk of bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B). The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of prasugrel in patients with severe hepatic disease have not been studied, but such patients are generally at higher risk of bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Metabolic Status</h3><p class="First">In healthy subjects, patients with stable atherosclerosis, and patients with ACS receiving prasugrel, there was no relevant effect of genetic variation in CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A5 on the pharmacokinetics of prasugrel's active metabolite or its inhibition of platelet aggregation.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Platelet inhibition by prasugrel is rapid and irreversible, lasting for the life of the platelet, and is unlikely to be increased in the event of an overdose. In rats, lethality was observed after administration of 2000 mg/kg. Symptoms of acute toxicity in dogs included emesis, increased serum alkaline phosphatase, and hepatocellular atrophy. Symptoms of acute toxicity in rats included mydriasis, irregular respiration, decreased locomotor activity, ptosis, staggering gait, and lacrimation.</p><h3>Recommendations about Specific Treatment</h3><p class="First">Platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability. The prasugrel active metabolite is not likely to be removed by dialysis.</p><h2>Prasugrel Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Prasugrel tablet contains prasugrel, a thienopyridine class inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation mediated by the P2Y <span class="Sub">12</span> ADP receptor. Prasugrel is formulated as the hydrochloride salt, a racemate, which is chemically designated as 5-[(1RS)-2-cyclopropyl-1-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-oxoethyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridin-2-yl acetate hydrochloride. Prasugrel hydrochloride has the empirical formula C <span class="Sub">20</span>H <span class="Sub">20</span>FNO <span class="Sub">3</span>S•HCl representing a molecular weight of 409.90. The chemical structure of prasugrel hydrochloride is:</p><p></p><p>Prasugrel hydrochloride is a white to practically white solid. It is soluble at pH 2, slightly soluble at pH 3 to 4, and practically insoluble at pH 6 to 7.5. It also dissolves freely in methanol and is slightly soluble in 1- and 2-propanol and acetone. It is practically insoluble in diethyl ether and ethyl acetate.</p><p>Prasugrel Tablets are available for oral administration as 5 mg or 10 mg film-coated, non-scored tablets, debossed on one side. Each 5 mg tablet is manufactured with 5.49 mg prasugrel hydrochloride, equivalent to 5 mg prasugrel and each 10 mg tablet with 10.98 mg prasugrel hydrochloride, equivalent to 10 mg of Prasugrel.</p><p>Other ingredients include mannitol, hypromellose, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, sucrose stearate, and glyceryl behenate. The color coatings contain lactose, hypromellose, titanium dioxide, triacetin, and iron oxide red.</p><h2>Prasugrel Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Prasugrel is an inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y <span class="Sub">12</span> class of ADP receptors on platelets.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Prasugrel produces inhibition of platelet aggregation to 20 μM or 5 μM ADP, as measured by light transmission aggregometry. Following a 60-mg loading dose of prasugrel, approximately 90% of patients had at least 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation by 1 hour. Maximum platelet inhibition was about 80% ( <span class="Italics">see</span> Figure 2). Mean steady-state inhibition of platelet aggregation was about 70% following 3 to 5 days of dosing at 10-mg daily after a 60-mg loading dose of prasugrel.</p><p></p><p>Platelet aggregation gradually returns to baseline values over 5-9 days after discontinuation of prasugrel, this time course being a reflection of new platelet production rather than pharmacokinetics of prasugrel. Discontinuing clopidogrel 75-mg and initiating a prasugrel 10-mg maintenance dose with or without a prasugrel 60-mg loading dose results in a decrease of 14 percentage points in maximum platelet aggregation (MPA) by Day 7. This decrease in MPA is not greater than that typically produced by a 10-mg maintenance dose of prasugrel alone. The relationship between inhibition of platelet aggregation and clinical activity has not been established.</p><p><span class="Italics">5-mg in Low Body Weight Patients</span> - In patients with stable coronary artery disease, mean platelet inhibition in subjects &lt;60 kg taking 5-mg prasugrel was similar to that of subjects ≥60 kg taking 10-mg prasugrel. The relationship between inhibition of platelet aggregation and clinical activity has not been established.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Prasugrel is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolized to a pharmacologically active metabolite and inactive metabolites. The active metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 7 hours (range 2-15 hours). Healthy subjects, patients with stable atherosclerosis, and patients undergoing PCI show similar pharmacokinetics.</p><p><span class="Italics">Absorption and Binding</span> - Following oral administration, ≥79% of the dose is absorbed. The absorption and metabolism are rapid, with peak plasma concentrations (C <span class="Sub">max</span>) of the active metabolite occurring approximately 30 minutes after dosing. The active metabolite's exposure (AUC) increases slightly more than proportionally over the dose range of 5 to 60-mg. Repeated daily doses of 10-mg do not lead to accumulation of the active metabolite. In a study of healthy subjects given a single 15-mg dose, the AUC of the active metabolite was unaffected by a high fat, high calorie meal, but C <span class="Sub">max</span> was decreased by 49% and T <span class="Sub">max</span> was increased from 0.5 to 1.5 hours. Prasugrel Tablets can be administered without regard to food. The active metabolite is bound about 98% to human serum albumin.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Elimination</span> - Prasugrel is not detected in plasma following oral administration. It is rapidly hydrolyzed in the intestine to a thiolactone, which is then converted to the active metabolite by a single step, primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. The estimates of apparent volume of distribution of prasugrel's active metabolite ranged from 44 to 68 L and the estimates of apparent clearance ranged from 112 to 166 L/hr in healthy subjects and patients with stable atherosclerosis. The active metabolite is metabolized to two inactive compounds by S-methylation or conjugation with cysteine. The major inactive metabolites are highly bound to human plasma proteins. Approximately 68% of the prasugrel dose is excreted in the urine and 27% in the feces as inactive metabolites.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Geriatric</span> - In a study of 32 healthy subjects between the ages of 20 and 80 years, age had no significant effect on pharmacokinetics of prasugrel's active metabolite or its inhibition of platelet aggregation. In TRITON-TIMI 38, the mean exposure (AUC) of the active metabolite was 19% higher in patients ≥75 years of age than in patients &lt;75 years of age. In a study in subjects with stable atherosclerosis, the mean exposure (AUC) to the active metabolite of prasugrel in subjects ≥75 years old taking a 5-mg maintenance dose was approximately half that seen in subjects 45 to 64 years old taking a 10-mg maintenance dose. <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5)]</span> .</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Body Weight</span> - The mean exposure (AUC) to the active metabolite is approximately 30 to 40% higher in subjects with a body weight of &lt;60 kg than in those weighing ≥60 kg.

Randomization was stratified for UA/NSTEMI and STEMI.</p><p>Patients with UA/NSTEMI presenting within 72 hours of symptom onset were to be randomized after undergoing coronary angiography. Patients with STEMI presenting within 12 hours of symptom onset could be randomized prior to coronary angiography. Patients with STEMI presenting between 12 hours and 14 days of symptom onset were to be randomized after undergoing coronary angiography. Patients underwent PCI, and for both UA/NSTEMI and STEMI patients, the loading dose was to be administered anytime between randomization and 1 hour after the patient left the catheterization lab. If patients with STEMI were treated with thrombolytic therapy, randomization could not occur until at least 24 hours (for tenecteplase, reteplase, or alteplase) or 48 hours (for streptokinase) after the thrombolytic was given.</p><p>Patients were randomized to receive prasugrel (60-mg loading dose followed by 10-mg once daily) or clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose followed by 75-mg once daily), with administration and follow-up for a minimum of 6 months (actual median 14.5 months). Patients also received aspirin (75-mg to 325-mg once daily). Other therapies, such as heparin and intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, were administered at the discretion of the treating physician. Oral anticoagulants, other platelet inhibitors, and chronic NSAIDs were not allowed.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke in the UA/NSTEMI population. Success in this group allowed analysis of the same endpoint in the overall ACS and STEMI populations. Nonfatal MIs included both MIs detected solely through analysis of creatine kinase muscle-brain (CK-MB) changes and clinically apparent (investigator-reported) MIs.</p><p>The patient population was 92% Caucasian, 26% female, and 39% ≥65 years of age. The median time from symptom onset to study drug administration was 7 hours for patients with STEMI and 30 hours for patients with UA/NSTEMI. Approximately 99% of patients underwent PCI. The study drug was administered after the first coronary guidewire was placed in approximately 75% of patients.</p><p>Prasugrel significantly reduced total endpoint events compared to clopidogrel ( <span class="Italics">see</span> Table 5 and Figure 3). The reduction of total endpoint events was driven primarily by a decrease in nonfatal MIs, both those occurring early (through 3 days) and later (after 3 days). Approximately 40% of MIs occurred peri-procedurally and were detected solely by changes in CK-MB. Administration of the clopidogrel loading dose in TRITON-TIMI 38 was delayed relative to the placebo-controlled trials that supported its approval for ACS. Prasugrel produced higher rates of clinically significant bleeding than clopidogrel in TRITON-TIMI 38 <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]</span> .

In the STEMI population, the early separation was maintained throughout the 15 month follow-up period, but there was no progressive divergence after the first few weeks.</p><p>Prasugrel reduced the occurrence of the primary composite endpoint compared to clopidogrel in both the UA/NSTEMI and STEMI populations ( <span class="Italics">see</span> Table 5). In patients who survived an on-study myocardial infarction, the incidence of subsequent events was also lower in the prasugrel group.</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">a</span> RRR = (1-Hazard Ratio) x 100%.

Results are generally consistent across pre-specified subgroups, with the exception of patients with a history of TIA or stroke <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications ( 4.2)]</span> . The treatment effect was driven primarily by a reduction in nonfatal MI. The effect in patients ≥75 years of age was also somewhat smaller, and bleeding risk is higher in these individuals <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]</span> . See below for analyses of patients ≥75 years of age with risk factors.</p><p></p><p>Prasugrel is generally not recommended in patients ≥75 years of age, except in high-risk situations (diabetes mellitus or prior MI) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered. These recommendations are based on subgroup analyses ( <span class="Italics">see</span> Table 6) and must be interpreted with caution, but the data suggest that prasugrel reduces ischemic events in such patients.</p><p>There were 50% fewer stent thromboses (95% C.I. 32% - 64%; p&lt;0.001) reported among patients randomized to prasugrel (0.9%) than among patients randomized to clopidogrel (1.8%). The difference manifested early and was maintained through one year of follow-up. Findings were similar with bare metal and drug-eluting stents.</p><p>In TRITON-TIMI 38, prasugrel reduced ischemic events (mainly nonfatal MIs) and increased bleeding events <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]</span> relative to clopidogrel. The findings are consistent with the intended greater inhibition of platelet aggregation by prasugrel at the doses used in the study <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2)]</span> . There is, however, an alternative explanation: both prasugrel and clopidogrel are pro-drugs that must be metabolized to their active moieties. Whereas the pharmacokinetics of prasugrel's active metabolite are not known to be affected by genetic variations in CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A5, the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel's active metabolite are affected by CYP2C19 genotype, and approximately 30% of Caucasians are reduced-metabolizers. Moreover, certain proton pump inhibitors, widely used in the ACS patient population and used in TRITON-TIMI 38, inhibit CYP2C19, thereby decreasing formation of clopidogrel's active metabolite. Thus, reduced-metabolizer status and use of proton pump inhibitors may diminish clopidogrel's activity in a fraction of the population, and may have contributed to prasugrel's greater treatment effect and greater bleeding rate in TRITON-TIMI 38. The extent to which these factors were operational, however, is unknown.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First">Prasugrel Tablets 5 mg are pink round shaped film-coated tablet, debossed "S77" on one side and blank on the other side, available as:</p><p>- bottles of 30 (NDC 48792-7822-1)</p><p>Prasugrel Tablets 10 mg are pink long hexagonal shaped film-coated tablets, debossed "L1" on one side and blank on the other side, available as:</p><p>- bottles of 30 (NDC 48792-7821-1)</p><h3>Storage and Handling</h3><p class="First">Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F) [see USP controlled room temperature].</p><p>Dispense and keep product in original container.
