The scientific literature contains primarily phytochemical and animal studies of the plant's activity on the nervous system. Limited clinical studies have been conducted.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>None well documented.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Contraindications have not yet been identified.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Lactation</h3><p>Avoid use during pregnancy and lactation because of the lack of clinical studies.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>None well documented.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>None well documented. Patients with known hypersensitivity reactions should avoid use.</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>A study reports genotoxicity of aqueous and hydro-alcoholic extract of N. jatamansi rhizome at concentrations of 5 and 10 mg/mL.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Valerianaceae</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>N. jatamansi is native to the Alpine Himalayas. It is a critically endangered, rhizome-bearing medicinal plant that prefers high altitudes (3,000 to 5,000 m).1 The genus has 4 to 5 stamens. The calyx consists of 5 well-developed lanceolate or dentate lobes that continue to grow during maturation of the fruit.</p><h2>History</h2><p>The plant has a rich history of medicinal use and has been valued for centuries in Ayurvedic (Indian) and Unani (ancient Greco-Arab) systems of medicine. The rhizomes of the plant are used in the Ayurvedic system of medicine as a bitter tonic, stimulant, antispasmodic, and to treat hysteria, convulsions, and epilepsy. The root has been medically used to treat insomnia and blood, circulatory, and mental disorders. Some preparations of the plant have been used as a heptotonic, cardiotonic, analgesic, and diuretic in the Unani system of medicine. The plant is of economic importance and has been used to produce perfumes and dyes.</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>The rhizomes and roots of the plant have medicinal value and, therefore, have been the focus of chemical studies. They contain a variety of sesquiterpenes and coumarins. The sedative sesquiterpene valeranone, which also is found in valerian and other plants, is a major component of the root essential oil, at least in some samples.2 Other terpenoids include spirojatamol,3 nardostachysin,4 jatamols A and B,5 and calarenol.6 Coumarins include jatamansin.7</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Antioxidant effect</h3><p>In vitro and rodent studies have shown that extracts of N. jatamansi possess antioxidant activity.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13</p><p>Some of these studies have also demonstrated activity against cancer cell lines,8, 9, 14 and protective effects from radiation-induced damage.15, 16</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the antioxidant activity of jatamansi.</p><h3>Anti-inflammatory effects</h3><p>Studies by a limited group of researchers have reported anti-inflammatory properties of jatamansi extracts in vitro and in rodents with induced pancreatitis.17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22</p><p>Effects on mediators of inflammation have been demonstrated, as well as reduced secretion of digestive enzymes.21</p><p>Research reveals no clinical studies evaluating anti-inflammatory properties of jatamansi.</p><h3>CNS activity</h3><p>Valeranone prolonged barbiturate anesthesia, impaired rotarod performance, inhibited electroshock convulsions, and potentiated the hypothermic effects of reserpine.23 Limited results from behavioral tests revealed that an extract from N. jatamansi exhibited significant antidepressant activity.24</p><p>A 15-day treatment with an alcoholic root extract of N. jatamansi caused an overall increase in the levels of central monoamines and inhibitory amino acids, including a change in the levels of serotonin, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, gamma-amino butyric acid, and taurine in rat brain.25</p><p>Pretreatment with an alcoholic extract dosed at 250 mg/kg of N. jatamansi for 15 days protected rats against focal ischemia caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion. The protective effect may be associated with improving glutathione content, inhibiting lipid peroxidation, and activity on the Na+/K+ ATPase and catalase enzyme systems.26</p><p>Studies on rodents of effects in the CNS are ongoing.27, 28, 29</p><h1>Clinical data</h1><p>A small study (n = 34) reported positive findings for N. jatamansi in the management of primary insomnia. The powdered rhizome was given at a dose of 4 g with milk 3 times a day after food for a period of 1 month. The comparator natural product was Valeriana wallichii, which also showed positive effects on sleep induction, duration, and other parameters.30</p><h3>Lipid-lowering activity</h3><p>A 50% ethanolic extract of Curcuma longa (tuber) and N. jatamansi (whole plant) elevated the HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio in triton-induced hyperlipidemic rats. There also was a reduction in the ratio of total cholesterol/phospholipids.31</p><p>Research reveals no clinical studies evaluating jatamansi for dyslipidemia.</p><h3>Other uses</h3><p>A hepatoprotective action was observed in rats pretreated with an alcoholic extract of N. jatamansi dosed at 800 mg/kg for 3 days against thioacetamide-induced liver damage. Rats pretreated with the extract also had reduced levels of serum transaminases (alanine and aspartate aminotransferase) and alkaline phosphatase.32</p><p>N. jatamansi essential oil demonstrated fungistatic activity against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, and Fusarium oxysporum.33, 34</p><p>Vascular dilatation, mediated via influencing NO production, by the volatile oil of the plant’s rhizome has been shown in vitro using cardiac tissue.35</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Clinical trials are lacking upon which to provide dosing guidance.</p><p>The powdered rhizome was given at a dose of 4 g with milk 3 times a day after food for a period of 1 month in a small study evaluating the effect on primary insomnia.30</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use during pregnancy and lactation because of the lack of clinical studies.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>None well documented. Patients with known hypersensitivity reactions should avoid use.</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>A study reports genotoxicity of aqueous and hydro-alcoholic extract of N. jatamansi rhizome at concentrations of 5 and 10 mg/ml.36</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
