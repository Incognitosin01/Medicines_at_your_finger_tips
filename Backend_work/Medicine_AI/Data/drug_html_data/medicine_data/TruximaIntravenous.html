Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections while you are receiving this medicine. Wash your hands often.

However, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) while you are being treated with rituximab-abbs and after you stop treatment with it, without your doctor's approval.

In addition, other persons living in your household should not get live vaccines (eg, nasal flu virus vaccine). Try to avoid persons who have taken live vaccines. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long.
