Capsaicin is present in a 0.025% concentration (w/w). It is chemically designated as (E)-N-[(4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) methyl]-8-methylnon-6-enamide and has an empirical formula of C18H27NO3. The molecular weight of capsaicin is 305.41 g/mol. Menthol is present in a 5% concentration (w/w). The chemical name is (1R,2S,5R)-2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanol. The empirical formula for menthol is C10H20O with a molecular weight of 156.27 g/mol.</p><p>The structural formulas are:</p><p>** Menthol ** ** Capsaicin**</p><p>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</p><p>Capsaicin is an active component of chili peppers known clinically as a rubefacient. It acts as a counter-irritant by producing heat when in contact with human tissue. Mechanistically, capsaicin exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by mimicking a burning sensation – whereby overwhelming the nerves by calcium influx, thereby rendering the nerves unable to signal a pain response for an extended period of time. With repeated exposure, the neurons become depleted of neurotransmitters –specifically substance P - leading to a reduction in the sensation of pain and the blockade of neurogenic inflammation. This process is reversed when the capsaicin is discontinued.</p><p>Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it also acts as a weak kappa (κ) opioid receptor agonist. Menthol acts to chemically trigger the cold-sensitive TRPM-8 receptors in the skin - responsible for the well-known cooling sensation it stimulates when applied directly to the skin. Menthol's analgesic properties are not fully understood, however they are mediated through a selective activation of κ-opioid receptors. Menthol also blocks voltage-sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscle tissue.</p><p>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</p><p>Relyyt Patch® is a formulation used to assist patients for the temporary relief of minor aches &amp; pains of muscles &amp; joints associated with arthritis, simple backache, strains, bruises, and sprains. Peripheral neuropathies such as diabetic neuropathy or post herpetic neuralgia, may also be symptomatically improved using this patch if recommended by the healthcare team.</p><p>Other uses may be considered if deemed clinically relevant.</p><p>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</p><p>Known hypersensitivity to menthol, capsaicin, or any of the inactive ingredients listed above.</p><p>WARNINGS:</p><p>1. Do not use on wounds, cuts, damaged or infected skin<br/>
2. Do not use on eyes, mouth, genitals, or any other mucous membranes</p><p>3. Keep out of reach of children</p><p>PRECAUTIONS:</p><p>Because of the possibility of sedation, patients should be cautioned regarding the operation of serious machinery or automobiles, and activities made hazardous by decreased alertness.<br/>
