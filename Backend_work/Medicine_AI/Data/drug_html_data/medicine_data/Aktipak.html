</ul><h2>Aktipak Description</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Aktipak<span class="Sup">®</span></span> contains erythromycin [(3R*,4S*,5S*,6R*,7R*,9R*,11R*,12R*,13S*,14R*)-4-[(2,6-dideoxy-3-C-methyl-3-O-methyl-a-L-ribo-hexopyranosyl)-oxy]-14-ethyl-7,12,13-trihydroxy-3,5,7,9,11,13-hexa-methyl-6-[[3,4,6-trideoxy-3-(dimethylamino)-b-D-xylo-hexopyranosyl]oxy]oxacyclotetradecane-2,10-dione]. Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic produced from a strain of <span class="Italics">Saccharopolyspora erythraea</span> (formerly <span class="Italics">Streptomyces erythreus</span>). It is a base and readily forms salts with acids.</p><p>Chemically, erythromycin is (C<span class="Sub">37</span>H<span class="Sub">67</span>NO<span class="Sub">13</span>). It has the following structural formula:</p><p>Erythromycin has the molecular weight of 733.94. It is a white crystalline powder and has a solubility of approximately 1 mg/mL in water and is soluble in alcohol at 25°C.</p><p>Aktipak<span class="Sup">®</span> also contains benzoyl peroxide for topical use. Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent demonstrating antibacterial activity.</p><p>Chemically, benzoyl peroxide is (C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">10</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>). It has the following structural formula:</p><p>Benzoyl peroxide has the molecular weight of 242.23. It is a white granular powder and is sparingly soluble in water and alcohol and soluble in acetone, chloroform and ether.</p><p>Each gram of product, as dispensed, contains 30 mg of erythromycin and 50 mg of benzoyl peroxide in a base of SD Alcohol 40B, purified water, hydroxypropyl cellulose, Carbomer Homopolymer Type B, sodium hydroxide, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate 75%. Each Aktipak<span class="Sup">®</span> contains 0.8 grams of product.</p><h2>Aktipak - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid. A single dose pharmacokinetic study, involving the application of either one or three units of Aktipak<span class="Sup">®</span>, was performed in 16 adult acne patients to determine systemic absorption of erythromycin. Erythromycin (with a plasma lower limit of quantitation of 2 ng/ml) was not detectable, except in one patient who was in the one unit application group.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The exact mechanism by which erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide reduce lesions of acne vulgaris is not fully known.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In two adequate and well controlled clinical studies 228 patients used Aktipak<span class="Sup">®</span>, 113 patients used the currently marketed Benzamycin Topical Gel, and 183 patients used vehicle. Aktipak<span class="Sup">®</span> applied twice daily for 8 weeks was significantly more effective than vehicle and comparable to Benzamycin Topical Gel in the treatment of moderate to moderately severe facial acne vulgaris. Patients entering the study had a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 80 facial inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) and a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 140 facial non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones). The primary efficacy measures evaluated at week 8 were the lesion counts and the investigator's global assessment.</p><p>Patients were instructed to wash their face twice daily (morning and evening) with warm water and a mild cleanser provided by sponsor. No abrasive cloths or sponges, alcoholic toners, astringents or medicated solutions were used. The medication was to be applied 15 minutes after washing, in a thin film over the entire facial area. A moisturizer (supplied by the sponsor) or non-medicated make-up could be applied one hour after application, as needed. All medications were to be kept away from the eyes. Sun exposure to the face was to be limited.</p><p>Outcomes for mean percent reductions in lesion counts and investigator's global assessment after 8 weeks of treatment are shown below:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mean % Lesion Counts Reduction</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">  Inflammatory</span>*</p><p class="First">49%</p><p class="First">45%</p><p class="First">17%</p><p class="First">28%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">  Non Inflammatory</span>*</p><p class="First">46%</p><p class="First">43%</p><p class="First">24%</p><p class="First">20%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">  Total</span>*</p><p class="First">48%</p><p class="First">44%</p><p class="First">22%</p><p class="First">26%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Investigator's Global</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">  Global Success</span>*</p><p class="First">28%</p><p class="First">27%</p><p class="First">3%</p><p class="First">11%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mean % Lesion Counts Reduction</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">  Inflammatory</span>*</p><p class="First">57%</p><p class="First">34%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">  Non Inflammatory</span></p><p class="First">36%</p><p class="First">30%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">  Total</span>*</p><p class="First">45%</p><p class="First">31%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Investigator's Global</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">  Global Success</span>*</p><p class="First">36%</p><p class="First">12%</p><h2>MICROBIOLOGY</h2><p class="First">Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by reversibly binding to 50 <span class="Bold">S</span> ribosomal subunits, thereby inhibiting translocation of aminoacyl transfer-RNA and inhibiting polypeptide synthesis. Antagonism has been demonstrated <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> between erythromycin, lincomycin, chloramphenicol and clindamycin.</p><p>Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be effective <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> against <span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes,</span> an anaerobe found in sebaceous follicles and comedones. Benzoyl peroxide is believed to act by releasing active oxygen.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Aktipak</h2><p class="First">Aktipak<span class="Sup">®</span> is indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Aktipak<span class="Sup">®</span> is contraindicated in those individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its components.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">For topical use only; not for ophthalmic use. Concomitant topical acne therapy should be used with caution because a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating or abrasive agents. If severe irritation develops, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.</p><p>The use of antibiotic agents may be associated with the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If this occurs, discontinue use and take appropriate measures.</p><p>Avoid contact with eyes and all mucous membranes.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients using Aktipak<span class="Sup">®</span> should receive the following information and instructions:</p><p>1.

The clinical significance of this is unknown.</p><p>Benzoyl peroxide in acetone at doses of 5 and 10 mg administered twice per week induced skin tumors in transgenic Tg.AC mice in a study using 20 weeks of topical treatment.</p><p>Benzoyl peroxide has been found to cause DNA strand breaks in a variety of mammalian cell types, to be mutagenic in <span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span> tests by some but not all investigators, and to cause sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells.</p><p>No animal studies have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or effects on fertility of topical erythromycin. However, long-term (2-year) oral studies in rats with erythromycin base and erythromycin ethylsuccinate and in rats and mice with erythromycin stearate did not provide evidence of tumorigenicity.</p><p>The genotoxicity of erythromycin stearate has been evaluated in the <span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span> reverse mutation assay, the mouse L5178Y lymphoma cell assay, and for sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells. These studies indicated that erythromycin stearate was not genotoxic.</p><p>There was no apparent effect on male or female fertility in rats fed erythromycin base at levels up to 0.25% of diet.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Aktipak<span class="Sup">®</span> or benzoyl peroxide.</p><p>There was no evidence of teratogenicity or any other adverse effect on reproduction in female rats fed erythromycin base (up to 0.25% diet) prior to and during mating, during gestation and through weaning of two successive litters.</p><p>There are no well-controlled trials in pregnant women with Aktipak<span class="Sup">®</span>. It is also not known whether Aktipak<span class="Sup">®</span> can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Aktipak<span class="Sup">®</span> should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Women</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether the ingredients of Aktipak<span class="Sup">®</span> are excreted in human milk after topical application. However, erythromycin is excreted in human milk following oral and parenteral erythromycin administration. Therefore, caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of this product in pediatric patients below 12 years of age have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">During clinical trials, 550 acne patients were studied. Of these patients, 236 were treated with Aktipak<span class="Sup">®</span>. The most frequently reported adverse event considered at least possibly related was dry skin (7.6%) as compared to Vehicle (3.9%). Application site reactions (stinging, burning sensation, tingling, erythema) were reported in 2.5% of patients versus 1.3% of Vehicle patients. Blepharitis, pruritus and photosensitivity reactions were reported in &lt;2% of patients who used the dual pouch product.</p><p class="First">DRY SKIN</p><p class="First">18 (7.6%)</p><p class="First">6 (3.9%)</p><p class="First">6 (5.0%)</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">APPLICATION SITE REACTION<br/>
