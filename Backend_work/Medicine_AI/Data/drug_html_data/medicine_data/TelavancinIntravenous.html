Use of telavancin in patients with pre-existing moderate/severe renal impairment (CrCl 50 mL/min or less) should be considered only when the anticipated benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk. Nephrotoxicity: New onset or worsening renal impairment has occurred. Monitor renal function in all patients. Embryofetal toxicity: Telavancin may cause fetal harm. In animal reproduction studies, adverse developmental outcomes were observed in 3 animal species at clinically relevant doses. Verify pregnancy status prior to initiating treatment and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>
