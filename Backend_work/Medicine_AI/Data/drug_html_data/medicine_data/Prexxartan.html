High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.</p><p>Valsartan is also used to treat heart failure and left ventricular failure after a heart attack. Left ventricular failure occurs when the left side of the heart (the main pumping chamber) becomes stiff and enlarged or swollen. This causes pooling of blood in the lungs because the heart is not pumping properly.</p><p>Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. Valsartan relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure. A lower blood pressure will increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Prexxartan</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

However, use is not recommended in children younger than 6 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of valsartan in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding.
