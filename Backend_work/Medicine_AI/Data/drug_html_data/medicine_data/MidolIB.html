Use the lowest dose that is effective in treating your condition.</p><p><b>An Midol IB overdose can damage your stomach or intestines.</b> The maximum amount of ibuprofen for adults is 800 milligrams per dose or 3200 mg per day (4 maximum doses).</p><p>A child's dose of ibuprofen is based on the age and weight of the child. Carefully follow the dosing instructions provided with children's Midol IB for the age and weight of your child. Ask a doctor or pharmacist if you have questions.</p><p>Take Midol IB with food or milk to lessen stomach upset.</p><p>Shake the <b>oral suspension</b> (liquid) before you measure a dose. Use the dosing syringe provided, or use a medicine dose-measuring device (not a kitchen spoon).</p><p>You must chew the chewable tablet before you swallow it.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Do not allow the liquid medicine to freeze.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since  Midol IB is used when needed, you may not be on a dosing schedule. Skip any missed dose if it's almost time for your next dose. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. Overdose symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, drowsiness, black or bloody stools, coughing up blood, shallow breathing, fainting, or coma.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking  Midol IB?</h2><p>Ask a doctor or pharmacist before using other medicines for pain, fever, swelling, or cold/flu symptoms. They may contain ingredients similar to Midol IB (such as aspirin, this medicine, ketoprofen, or naproxen).</p><p>Avoid taking aspirin unless your doctor tells you to.</p><p>If you also take aspirin to prevent stroke or heart attack, taking Midol IB can make aspirin less effective in protecting your heart and blood vessels. If you take both medicines, take this medicine at least 8 hours before or 30 minutes after you take aspirin (non-enteric coated form).</p><p>Avoid drinking alcohol. It may increase your risk of stomach bleeding.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Midol IB side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction</b> (hives, difficult breathing, swelling in your face or throat) <b>or a severe skin reaction</b> (fever, sore throat, burning eyes, skin pain, red or purple skin rash with blistering and peeling).</p><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of a heart attack or stroke:</b> chest pain spreading to your jaw or shoulder, sudden numbness or weakness on one side of the body, slurred speech, leg swelling, feeling short of breath.</p><p>Stop using Midol IB and call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
