</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for this Medicine</h2><p>The anticholinergics and antispasmodics are a group of medicines that include the natural belladonna alkaloids (atropine, belladonna, hyoscyamine, and scopolamine) and related products.</p><p>The anticholinergics and antispasmodics are used to relieve cramps or spasms of the stomach, intestines, and bladder. Some are used together with antacids or other medicines in the treatment of peptic ulcers. Others are used to prevent nausea, vomiting, and motion sickness.</p><p>Anticholinergics and antispasmodics are also used in certain surgical and emergency procedures. In surgery, some are given by injection before anesthesia to help relax you and to decrease secretions, such as saliva. During anesthesia and surgery, atropine, glycopyrrolate, hyoscyamine, and scopolamine are used to help keep the heartbeat normal. Scopolamine is also used to prevent nausea and vomiting after anesthesia and surgery. Atropine is also given by injection to help relax the stomach and intestines for certain types of procedures.</p><p>Anticholinergics are used to treat poisoning caused by medicines such as neostigmine and physostigmine, certain types of mushrooms, and “nerve” gases or organic phosphorous pesticides (eg, demeton [Systox®], diazinon, malathion, parathion, and ronnel [Trolene®]). Anticholinergics can be used for painful menstruation, runny nose, and to prevent urination during sleep.</p><p>The anticholinergics and antispasmodics are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using this Medicine</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Unusual excitement, nervousness, restlessness, or irritability, and unusual warmth, dryness, and flushing of the skin are more likely to occur in children. Children are usually more sensitive to the effects of anticholinergics. Also, when anticholinergics are given to children during hot weather, a rapid increase in body temperature may occur. In infants and children, especially those with spastic paralysis or brain damage, this medicine may be more likely to cause severe side effects. Shortness of breath or difficulty with breathing has occurred in children taking dicyclomine.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Confusion or memory loss; constipation; difficult urination; drowsiness; dryness of the mouth, nose, throat, or skin; and unusual excitement, nervousness, restlessness, or irritability may be more likely to occur in the elderly. The elderly are usually more sensitive than younger adults to the effects of anticholinergics. Also, eye pain may occur, which may be a sign of glaucoma.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>If you are pregnant or if you may become pregnant, make sure your doctor knows if your medicine contains any of the following:</p><ul>
<li>Atropine—Atropine has not been shown to cause birth defects or other problems in animals. However, when injected into women during pregnancy, atropine increased the heartbeat of the fetus.</li>
<li>Belladonna—Belladonna has not been studied in pregnant women or animals.</li>
<li>Clidinium—Clidinium has not been studied in pregnant women. However, clidinium has not been shown to cause birth defects or other problems in animals.</li>
<li>Dicyclomine—Dicyclomine has been associated with a few cases of human birth defects, but dicyclomine has not been confirmed as the cause.</li>
<li>Glycopyrrolate—Glycopyrrolate has not been studied in pregnant women. However, glycopyrrolate did not cause birth defects in animal studies, but did decrease the chance of becoming pregnant and the newborn's chance of surviving after weaning.</li>
<li>Hyoscyamine—Hyoscyamine has not been studied in pregnant women or animals. However, when injected into women during pregnancy, hyoscyamine increased the heartbeat of the fetus.</li>
<li>Mepenzolate—Mepenzolate has not been studied in pregnant women. However, studies in animals have not shown that mepenzolate causes birth defects or other problems.</li>
<li>Propantheline—Propantheline has not been studied in pregnant women or animals.</li>
<li>Scopolamine—Scopolamine has not been studied in pregnant women or animals.</li>
</ul><h3>Breast Feeding</h3><p>Although these medicines may pass into the breast milk, they have not been reported to cause problems in nursing babies. However, the flow of breast milk may be reduced in some patients. The use of dicyclomine is contraindicated and should not be used in nursing mothers because it has been reported to cause breathing problems in infants.</p><h3>Interactions with Medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Taking an overdose of any of the belladonna alkaloids or taking scopolamine with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants may lead to unconsciousness and possibly death. Some signs of overdose are clumsiness or unsteadiness; dizziness; severe drowsiness; fever; hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there); confusion; shortness of breath or troubled breathing; slurred speech; unusual excitement, nervousness, restlessness, or irritability; fast heartbeat; and unusual warmth, dryness, and flushing of skin.</p><p>These medicines may make you sweat less, causing your body temperature to increase. <i>Use extra care not to become overheated during exercise or hot weather while you are taking this medicine</i>, since overheating may result in heat stroke. Also, hot baths or saunas may make you dizzy or faint while you are taking this medicine.</p><p><i>Check with your doctor before you stop using this medicine</i>. Your doctor may want you to reduce gradually the amount you are using before stopping completely. Stopping this medicine may cause withdrawal side effects such as vomiting, sweating, and dizziness.</p><p>Anticholinergics and antispasmodics may cause some people to have blurred vision. <i>Make sure your vision is clear before you drive or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not able to see well</i>. These medicines may also cause your eyes to become more sensitive to light than they are normally. Wearing sunglasses may help lessen the discomfort from bright light.</p><p>These medicines, especially in high doses, may cause some people to become dizzy or drowsy. <i>Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or are not alert</i>.</p><p>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem.</p><p>These medicines may cause dryness of the mouth, nose, and throat. For temporary relief of mouth dryness, use sugarless candy or gum, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. However, if your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your medical doctor or dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.</p><p>For patients taking <i>scopolamine</i>:</p><ul>
<li>This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that slow down the nervous system, possibly causing drowsiness). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds; sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine; prescription pain medicine or narcotics; barbiturates; medicine for seizures; muscle relaxants; or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are using this medicine.</li>
