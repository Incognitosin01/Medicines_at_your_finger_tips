This enzyme is necessary for processing excess nitrogen produced when the body metabolizes proteins. Without this enzyme, nitrogen builds up in the form of ammonia and is not removed from the body. Ammonia is very toxic when it circulates in blood and tissues and can cause permanent brain damage, coma, or death.</p><p>Carbaglu is used to treat hyperammonemia (HYE-per-AM-moe-NEE-mee-a), a urea cycle disorder caused by lack of a certain liver enzyme.</p><p>Carbaglu is usually given with other medications to treat this lifelong disorder.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Avoid eating foods that are high in protein when you first start taking Carbaglu. Follow your doctor's instructions about any other restrictions on food, beverages, or activity. <b>If you skip a meal, do not take your dose of Carbaglu.</b> Wait until your next meal.</p><p>To be sure Carbaglu is helping your condition and is not causing harmful effects, your blood will need to be tested often. <b>A buildup of ammonia in the blood can quickly cause brain injury or death.</b> Do not miss any follow up visits to your doctor for blood tests. Every person with a urea cycle disorder should remain under the care of a doctor.</p><p>Tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Carbaglu is only part of a complete program of treatment that may also include a special diet and other medications.
