Aatazanavir is a protease inhibitor antiviral medication that prevents human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from multiplying in your body. Cobicistat reduces the action of enzymes in your liver that break down certain antiviral medicines. This allows the antiviral medicines to be used more safely and effectively at lower doses.</p><p>Evotaz is a prescription medicine given together with other antiviral medicines to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in adults. HIV is the virus that can cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is not a cure for HIV or AIDS.</p><p>Evotaz is for use in adults and children who weigh at least 77 pounds (35 kilograms).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Serious drug interactions can occur when certain medicines are used together with Evotaz. Tell each of your healthcare providers about all medicines you use now, and any medicine you start or stop using.</p><p>Evotaz should not be used during pregnancy. People who are pregnant have developed a serious condition called lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the blood) when taking Evotaz with other HIV medicines.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not take Evotaz if you are allergic to atazanavir and cobicistat.</p><p>Many drugs can interact and cause dangerous effects.
