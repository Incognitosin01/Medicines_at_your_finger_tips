Propofol is an anesthetic and a sedative. Propofol may also be used to sedate coronavirus (COVID-19) patients who need mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit.</p><p>Propofol is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using propofol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For propofol, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to propofol or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of propofol injection to <i>induce anesthesia in children 3 years of age and older</i>, and to <i>maintain anesthesia in children 2 months of age and older</i>. Use of propofol to <i>induce anesthesia in children younger than 3 years of age</i> and to <i>maintain anesthesia in children younger than 2 months of age</i> is not recommended. Safety and efficacy have not been established <i>in children for other approved conditions</i>.</p><p>Serious unwanted effects on early brain development of children younger than 3 years of age may occur with repeated or prolonged use of propofol. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of propofol injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related heart or lung disease (eg, low blood pressure, breathing problems), which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving propofol.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving propofol, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using propofol with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.
