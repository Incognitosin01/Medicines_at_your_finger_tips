It works in the brain to change how your body feels and responds to pain. Acetaminophen is a less potent pain reliever that increases the effects of oxycodone. Acetaminophen can also help reduce a fever.</p><p>Roxicet is a prescription medicine used to relieve moderate to severe pain.</p><p>Roxicet works best if used at the first sign of pain occuring. If you wait until the pain has worsened, the medication may not work as well.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Roxicet if you have recently used alcohol, sedatives, tranquilizers, or other narcotic medications.</p><p><b>Roxicet can slow or stop your breathing, and may be habit-forming.</b> Use only your prescribed dose, and swallow the tablet whole to avoid a potentially fatal dose. Never share Roxicet with another person.</p><p><b>MISUSE OF OPIOID MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it.</p><p>Do not take more Roxicet than is recommended. An overdose of acetaminophen can damage your liver or cause death. Call your doctor at once if you have nausea, pain in your upper stomach, itching, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-colored stools, or jaundice (yellowing of your skin or eyes).</p><p><b>Oxycodone may cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in a newborn if the mother has taken Roxicet during pregnancy.</b></p><p><b>An overdose of acetaminophen can damage your liver or cause death.</b> Call your doctor at once if you have pain in your upper stomach, loss of appetite, dark urine, or jaundice (yellowing of your skin or eyes).</p><p><b>Stop taking Roxicet and call your doctor right away if you have skin redness or a rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling.</b></p><p><b>Fatal side effects can occur if you use this medicine with alcohol, or with other drugs that cause drowsiness or slow your breathing.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Roxicet if you are allergic to acetaminophen or oxycodone, or if you have:</p><ul>
