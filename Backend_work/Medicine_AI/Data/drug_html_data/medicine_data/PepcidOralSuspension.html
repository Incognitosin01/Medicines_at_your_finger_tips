When constituted as directed, PEPCID suspension is a smooth, mobile, off-white, homogeneous suspension with a cherry-banana-mint flavor, containing 40 mg of famotidine per 5 mL.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">PEPCID for oral suspension is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) to famotidine or other histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonists.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h2>5.1 Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions, including confusion, delirium, hallucinations, disorientation, agitation, seizures, and lethargy, have been reported in elderly patients and patients with moderate and severe renal impairment treated with famotidine. Since famotidine blood levels are higher in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal renal function, dosage adjustments are recommended in patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>5.2 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy</h2><p class="First">In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with PEPCID for oral suspension does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider evaluation for gastric malignancy in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with PEPCID for oral suspension.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h2>6.1 Clinical Trial Experience</h2><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety of PEPCID for oral suspension has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of another oral famotidine product <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span> The following is a summary of the adverse reactions reported in those studies.</p><p>Oral famotidine was studied in 7 US and international placebo- and active-controlled trials in approximately 2500 patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. A total of 1442 patients were treated with famotidine, including 302 treated with 40 mg twice daily, 456 treated with 20 mg twice daily, 461 treated with 40 mg once daily, and 396 treated with 20 mg once daily. The population was 17 to 91 years old, fairly well distributed between sex and race; however, the predominant race was Caucasian.</p><p>The following adverse reactions occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of famotidine-treated patients: headache, dizziness and constipation.</p><p>The following other adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients in clinical trials:</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole:</span> fever, asthenia, fatigue</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> palpitations</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> elevated liver enzymes, vomiting, nausea, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, dry mouth</p><p><span class="Italics">Hematologic:</span> thrombocytopenia</p><p><span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity:</span> orbital edema, rash, conjunctival injection, bronchospasm</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System/Psychiatric:</span> seizure, hallucinations, depression, anxiety, decreased libido, insomnia, somnolence</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin:</span> pruritus, dry skin, flushing</p><p><span class="Italics">Special Senses:</span> tinnitus, taste disorder</p><p><span class="Italics">Other:</span> impotence</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients Less Than One Year of Age</span></p><p>In a clinical study in 35 pediatric patients less than 1 year of age with GERD symptoms, two patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. Agitation observed in 5 patients resolved when famotidine was discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h2>6.2 Postmarketing Experience</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of famotidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> arrhythmia, AV block, prolonged QT interval</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis</p><p><span class="Italics">Hematologic:</span> agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, leukopenia</p><p><span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity:</span> anaphylaxis, angioedema, facial edema, urticaria</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> rhabdomyolysis, muscle cramps<br/>

<span class="Italics">Respiratory:</span> interstitial pneumonia<br/>
<span class="Italics">Skin:</span> toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h2>7.1 Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption</h2><p class="First">Famotidine can reduce the absorption of other drugs, due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity, leading to loss of efficacy of the concomitant drug.</p><p>Concomitant administration of PEPCID for oral suspension with dasatinib, delavirdine mesylate, cefditoren, and fosamprenavir is not recommended.</p><p>See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption for administration instructions, including atazanavir, erlotinib, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, nilotinib, and rilpivirine.</p><h2>7.2 Tizanidine (CYP1A2 Substrate)</h2><p class="First">Although not studied clinically, famotidine is considered a weak CYP1A2 inhibitor and may lead to substantial increases in blood concentrations of tizanidine, a CYP1A2 substrate. Avoid concomitant use with PEPCID for oral suspension. If concomitant use is necessary, monitor for hypotension, bradycardia or excessive drowsiness. Refer to the full prescribing information for tizanidine.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Risk Summary</p><p>Available data with H2-receptor antagonists, including famotidine, in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse development effects were observed with oral administration of famotidine at doses up to approximately 243 and 122 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 80 mg per day for the treatment of erosive esophagitis <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p>Data</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Reproductive studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses of up to 2000 and 500 mg/kg/day, respectively, and in both species at intravenous doses of up to 200 mg/kg/day, and have revealed no significant evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to famotidine. While no direct fetotoxic effects have been observed, sporadic abortions occurring only in mothers displaying marked decreased food intake were seen in some rabbits at oral doses of 200 mg/kg/day (about 49 times the recommended human dose of 80 mg per day, based on body surface area) or higher. There are, however, no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are limited data available on the presence of famotidine in human breast milk. There were no effects on the breastfed infant. There are no data on famotidine effects on milk production. Famotidine is present in the milk of lactating rats <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for famotidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from PEPCID for oral suspension or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p>Data</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Transient growth depression was observed in young rats suckling from mothers treated with maternotoxic doses of famotidine at least 600 times the usual human dose.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Peptic Ulcer Disease and GERD With or Without Esophagitis and Ulcerations</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients One Year to Less than 17 Years of Age</span></p><p>The safety and effectiveness of PEPCID for oral suspension have been established in pediatric patients 1 year to less than 17 years of age for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease and GERD with or without esophagitis and ulcerations. Use of PEPCID in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of famotidine in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in pediatric patients 1 year to less than 17 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)]</span>.

In these studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In postmarketing experience, CNS adverse reactions have been reported in elderly patients with and without renal impairment receiving famotidine <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>Famotidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to PEPCID for oral suspension may be greater in elderly patients, particularly those with impaired renal function <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><p>In general, use the lowest effective dose of PEPCID for oral suspension for an elderly patient and monitor renal function <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">CNS adverse reactions and prolonged QT intervals have been reported in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span> The clearance of famotidine is reduced in adults with moderate and severe renal impairment compared to adults with normal renal function <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> No dosage adjustment is needed in adults with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/minute). Dosage reduction is recommended in adults with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].</span> Data are not available to establish a safe and effective dosage in pediatric patients with renal impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The types of adverse reactions in overdosage of famotidine are similar to the adverse reactions encountered with use of recommended dosages <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Unabsorbed material should be removed from the gastrointestinal tract, the patient should be monitored, and supportive therapy should be employed.</p><p>Due to low binding to plasma proteins, famotidine is eliminated by hemodialysis. There is limited experience on the usefulness of hemodialysis as a treatment for famotidine overdosage.</p><h2>Pepcid Oral Suspension Description</h2><p class="First">The active ingredient in PEPCID (famotidine) for oral suspension is a histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonist. Famotidine is <span class="Italics">N'</span>-(aminosulfonyl)-3-[[[2-[(diaminomethylene)amino]-4-thiazolyl]methyl]thio]propanimidamide. The empirical formula of famotidine is C8H15N7O2S3 and its molecular weight is 337.43. Its structural formula is:</p><p>Each 5 mL of PEPCID for oral suspension when prepared as directed contains 40 mg of famotidine and the following inactive ingredients: citric acid, flavors (cherry, banana, and mint), microcrystalline cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose sodium sucrose and xanthan gum. Added as preservatives are sodium benzoate 0.1%, sodium methylparaben 0.1% and sodium propylparaben 0.02%.</p><p>Famotidine is a white to pale yellow crystalline compound that is freely soluble in glacial acetic acid, slightly soluble in methanol, very slightly soluble in water, and practically insoluble in ethanol.</p><h2>Pepcid Oral Suspension - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Famotidine is a competitive inhibitor of histamine-2 (H2) receptors. The primary clinically important pharmacologic activity of famotidine is inhibition of gastric secretion. Both the acid concentration and volume of gastric secretion are suppressed by famotidine, while changes in pepsin secretion are proportional to volume output.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Adults Famotidine inhibited both basal and nocturnal gastric secretion, as well as secretion stimulated by food and pentagastrin. After oral administration of famotidine, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurred within one hour; the maximum effect was dose-dependent, occurring within one to three hours. Duration of inhibition of secretion by doses of 20 mg and 40 mg was 10 to 12 hours.</p><p>Single evening oral doses of 20 mg and 40 mg inhibited basal and nocturnal acid secretion in all subjects; mean nocturnal gastric acid secretion was inhibited by 86% and 94%, respectively, for a period of at least 10 hours. The same doses given in the morning suppressed food-stimulated acid secretion in all subjects. The mean suppression was 76% and 84%, respectively, 3 to 5 hours after administration, and 25% and 30%, respectively, 8 to 10 hours after administration. In some subjects who received the 20 mg dose, however, the antisecretory effect was dissipated within 6 to 8 hours. There was no cumulative effect with repeated doses. The nocturnal intragastric pH was raised by evening doses of 20 mg and 40 mg of</p><p>famotidine to mean values of 5.0 and 6.4, respectively. When famotidine was given after breakfast, the basal daytime interdigestive pH at 3 and 8 hours after 20 mg or 40 mg of famotidine was raised to about 5.</p><p>Famotidine had little or no effect on fasting or postprandial serum gastrin levels. Gastric emptying and exocrine pancreatic function were not affected by famotidine.</p><p>In clinical pharmacology studies, systemic effects of famotidine in the CNS, cardiovascular, respiratory or endocrine systems were not noted. Also, no anti-androgenic effects were noted. Serum hormone levels, including prolactin, cortisol, thyroxine (T4), and testosterone, were not altered after treatment with famotidine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>Pharmacodynamics of famotidine, assessed by gastric pH, were evaluated in 5 pediatric patients 2 years to 13 years of age using the sigmoid Emax model. These data suggest that the relationship between serum concentration of famotidine and gastric acid suppression is similar to that observed in adults (see Table 3).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">EC<span class="Sub">50</span> (ng/mL)</span>*</p><p class="First">Pediatric Patients</p><p class="First">26 ± 13</p><p class="First">Adults</p><p class="First">26.5 ± 10.3</p><p class="First">18.7 ± 10.8</p><p>In a study examining the effect of famotidine on gastric pH and duration of acid suppression in pediatric patients, four pediatric patients ages 11 to 15 years of age using the oral formulation at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, maintained a gastric pH above 5 for 13.5 ± 1.8 hours.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Famotidine is incompletely absorbed.

In <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> studies in mice, with a micronucleus test and a chromosomal aberration test, no evidence of a mutagenic effect was observed.</p><p>In studies with rats given oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg/day (approximately 243 times, based on body surface area, the recommended human dose of 80 mg per day) fertility and reproductive performance were not affected.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of PEPCID for oral suspension have been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of another oral famotidine product<span class="Italics">.</span> The following is a summary of the efficacy results reported in those studies.</p><h2>14.1 Active Duodenal Ulcer</h2><p class="First">In a U.S. multicenter, double-blind trial in adult outpatients with endoscopically confirmed duodenal ulcer (DU), orally administered famotidine was compared to placebo. As shown in Table 4, 70% of patients treated with famotidine 40 mg at bedtime were healed by Week 4. Most patients’ DU healed within 4 weeks.</p><p>Patients not healed by Week 4 were continued in the trial. By Week 8, 83% of patients treated with famotidine had healed DU, compared to 45% of patients treated with placebo. The incidence of DU healing with famotidine was greater than with placebo at each time point based on proportion of endoscopically confirmed healed DUs. Trials have not assessed the safety of famotidine in uncomplicated active DU for periods of more than 8 weeks.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Famotidine</span><br/>

Antacids were permitted during the trials, but consumption was not significantly different between the famotidine and placebo groups.</p><p>As shown in Table 5, the incidence of GU healing confirmed by endoscopy (dropouts counted as unhealed) with famotidine was greater than placebo at Weeks 6 and 8 in the U.S. trial, and at Weeks 4, 6 and 8 in the international trial.</p><p>In these trials, most famotidine-treated patients healed within 6 weeks.

Healing was defined as complete resolution of all erosions visible with endoscopy. The U.S. trial comparing orally administered famotidine 40 mg twice daily to placebo and orally administered famotidine 20 mg twice daily showed a significantly greater percentage of healing of erosive esophagitis for famotidine 40 mg twice daily at Weeks 6 and 12 (Table 7).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Famotidine</span><br/>

Orally administered famotidine dosages from 20 mg to 160 mg every 6 hours maintained basal acid secretion below 10 mEq/hour; initial dosages were titrated to the individual patient need and subsequent adjustments were necessary with time in some patients.</p><h2>14.6 Risk Reduction of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence</h2><p class="First">Two randomized, double-blind, multicenter trials in patients with endoscopically confirmed healed DUs demonstrated that patients receiving treatment with orally administered famotidine 20 mg at bedtime had lower rates of DU recurrence, as compared with placebo.</p><p>Controlled trials have not extended beyond one year.</p><h2>14.7 GERD in Pediatric Patients Less than 1 Year of Age</h2><p class="First">In a double-blind, randomized, treatment-withdrawal study, 35 pediatric patients less than 1 year of age who were diagnosed with GERD, primarily by history of vomiting (spitting up) and irritability (fussiness), were treated for up to 4 weeks with famotidine oral suspension 0.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg administered once daily for patients less than 3 months of age and administered twice daily for patients 3 months to less than 12 months of age. Caregivers were instructed to provide conservative treatment including thickened feedings. After 4 weeks of treatment, patients were randomly withdrawn from the treatment and followed an additional 4 weeks for vomiting (spitting up), irritability (fussiness) and global assessments of improvement. The study patients ranged in age at entry from 1.3 to 10.5 months (mean 5.6 ±</p><p>2.9 months), 57% were female, 91% were white and 6% were black. Most patients (27/35) continued into the treatment-withdrawal phase of the study. Most patients improved during the initial treatment phase of the study. Results of the treatment-withdrawal phase were difficult to interpret because of small numbers of patients.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">PEPCID (famotidine) for oral suspension is supplied as follows:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NDC</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Strength</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Quantity</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Description</span></p><p class="First">0006-3538-92</p><p class="First">40 mg</p><p class="First">Bottle</p><p class="First">white to off-white powder.
