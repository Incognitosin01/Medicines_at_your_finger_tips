<li><span class="Bold">The use of benzodiazepines, including DORAL, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing DORAL and throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)]</span> .</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">The continued use of benzodiazepines, including DORAL, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of DORAL after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening.

</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Doral Tablets</h2><p class="First">DORAL is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and/or early morning awakenings. The effectiveness of DORAL has been established in placebo-controlled clinical studies of 5 nights duration in acute and chronic insomnia. The sustained effectiveness of DORAL has been established in chronic insomnia in a sleep lab (polysomnographic) study of 28 nights duration. Because insomnia is often transient and intermittent, the prolonged administration of Doral Tablets is generally not necessary or recommended. Since insomnia may be a symptom of several other disorders, the possibility that the complaint may be related to a condition for which there is a more specific treatment should be considered.</p><h2>Doral Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>2.1 Dosage Recommendations</h3><p class="First">Use the lowest dose effective for the patient, as important adverse effects of DORAL are dose related. The recommended initial dose is 7.5 mg. The 7.5 mg dose can be increased to 15 mg if necessary for efficacy. The 7.5 mg dose can be achieved by splitting the 15 mg tablet along the score line.</p><h3>2.2 Special Populations</h3><p class="First">Elderly and debilitated patients may be more sensitive to benzodiazepines.</p><h3>2.3 Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of DORAL</h3><p class="First">To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue DORAL or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3)]</span> .</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Tablets, 15 mg, functionally scored, capsule-shaped, light orange, slightly white speckled tablets, impressed with the product identification number 15 on one side of the tablet, and the product name (DORAL) on the other.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">DORAL is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to DORAL or other benzodiazepines. Rare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of DORAL. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Patients who develop such reactions should not be rechallenged with DORAL.</p><p>Contraindicated in patients with established or suspected sleep apnea, or with pulmonary insufficiency.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>5.1 Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including DORAL, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe DORAL concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of DORAL than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking DORAL, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when DORAL is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined. <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions ( 7)]</span> .</p><h3>5.2 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction</h3><p class="First">The use of benzodiazepines, including DORAL, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.2)]</span> .</p><p>Before prescribing DORAL and throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of DORAL, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of DORAL along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.</p><h3>5.3 Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions</h3><p class="First">To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue DORAL or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3)]</span> .</p><p>Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use.</p><p><span class="Bold">Acute Withdrawal Reactions</span><br/>
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including DORAL, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of DORAL after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3)]</span> .</p><p><span class="Bold">Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome</span><br/>
In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3)]</span> .</p><h3>5.4 CNS-Depressant Effects and Daytime Impairment</h3><p class="First">DORAL is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant and can impair daytime function in some patients even when used as prescribed. Prescribers should monitor for excess depressant effects, but impairment can occur in the absence of subjective symptoms, and may not be reliably detected by ordinary clinical exam (i.e. less than formal psychomotor testing). While pharmacodynamics tolerance or adaptation to some adverse depressant effects of DORAL may develop, patients using DORAL should be cautioned against driving or engaging in other hazardous activities or activities requiring complete mental alertness.</p><p>Additive effects occur with concomitant use of other CNS depressants (e.g., other benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol), including daytime use. Downward dose adjustment of DORAL and concomitant CNS depressants should be considered. The potential for adverse drug interactions continues for several days following discontinuation of DORAL, until serum levels of both active parent drug and psychoactive metabolites decline.</p><p>Use of DORAL with other sedative-hypnotics is not recommended. Alcohol generally should not be used during treatment with DORAL. The risk of next-day psychomotor impairment is increased if DORAL is taken with less than a full night of sleep remaining (7 to 8 hours); if higher than the recommended dose is taken; if co-administered with other CNS depressants <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1)]</span> .</p><p>Because DORAL can cause drowsiness and a decreased level of consciousness, patients particularly the elderly, are at higher risk of falls.</p><h3>5.5 Need to Evaluate for Co-morbid Diagnoses</h3><p class="First">Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative-hypnotic drugs.</p><h3>5.6 Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions</h3><p class="First">Rare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including DORAL. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis.</p><p>Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with DORAL should not be rechallenged with the drug.</p><h3>5.7 Abnormal Thinking and Behavior Changes</h3><p class="First">Abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported in patients treated with sedative-hypnotics including DORAL. Some of these changes include decreased inhibition (e.g., aggressiveness and extroversion that seemed out of character), bizarre behavior, and depersonalization. Visual and auditory hallucinations have also been reported. Amnesia, and other neuro-psychiatric symptoms may occur.</p><p>Paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, agitation, increased muscle spasticity, and sleep disturbances may occur unpredictably.</p><p>Complex behaviors such as "sleep-driving" (i.e., driving while not fully awake, with amnesia for the event) have been reported with use of sedative-hypnotics. These behaviors can occur with initial treatment or in patients previously tolerant of DORAL or other sedative-hypnotics. Although these behaviors can occur with use at therapeutic doses, risk is increased by higher doses or concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS depressants. Due to risk to the patient and community, DORAL should be discontinued if "sleep-driving" occurs.</p><p>Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events.</p><h3>5.8 Worsening of Depression</h3><p class="First">Benzodiazepines may worsen depression. Consequently, appropriate precautions (e.g., limiting the total prescription size and increased monitoring for suicidal ideation) should be considered.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:</p><ul class="Disc">

<li>Worsening of depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>6.1 Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The table shows adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of 1% or greater in relatively short-duration, placebo-controlled clinical trials of DORAL.</p><p>A double-blind, controlled sleep laboratory study (N=30) in elderly patients compared the effects of DORAL 7.5 mg and 15 mg to that of placebo over a period of 7 days. Both the 7.5 mg and 15 mg doses appeared to be well tolerated. Caution must be used in interpreting this data due to the small size of the study.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p>Benzodiazepines, including DORAL, produce additive CNS depressant effects when co-administered with ethanol or other CNS depressants (e.g. psychotropic medications, anticonvulsants, antihistamines). Downward dose adjustment of DORAL and/or concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary because of additive effects.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>8.1 Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Administration of benzodiazepines immediately prior to or during childbirth can result in a syndrome of hypothermia, hypotonia, respiratory depression, and difficulty feeding. In addition, infants born to mothers who have taken benzodiazepines during the later stages of pregnancy can develop dependence, and subsequently withdrawal, during the postnatal period. Although administration of DORAL to pregnant animals did not indicate a risk for adverse effects on morphological development at clinically relevant doses, data for other benzodiazepines suggest the possibility of adverse developmental effects (long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function) in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines. DORAL should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.</p><p>Developmental toxicity studies of DORAL in mice at doses up to 400 times the human dose (15 mg) revealed no major drug-related malformations. Minor fetal skeletal variations that occurred were delayed ossification of the sternum, vertebrae, distal phalanges and supraoccipital bones, at doses approximately 70 and 400 times the human dose. A developmental toxicity study of DORAL in New Zealand rabbits at doses up to approximately 130 times the human dose demonstrated no effect on fetal morphology or development of offspring.</p><h3>8.3 Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">DORAL and its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when administering DORAL to a nursing woman.</p><h3>8.4 Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>8.5 Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">DORAL may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly. Elderly patients generally should be started on a low dose of DORAL and observed closely. Elderly and debilitated patients may be more sensitive to benzodiazepines, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A double-blind controlled sleep laboratory study (N=30) compared the effects of DORAL 7.5 mg and 15 mg to that of placebo over a period of 7 days. Both the 7.5 mg and 15 mg doses appeared to be well tolerated. Caution must be used in interpreting this data due to the small size of the study.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>9.1 Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">DORAL contains quazepam, a Schedule IV controlled substance.</p><h3>9.2 Abuse</h3><p class="First">DORAL is a benzodiazepine and a CNS depressant with a potential for abuse and addiction. Abuse is the intentional, nontherapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Even taking benzodiazepines as prescribed may put patients at risk for abuse and misuse of their medication. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines may lead to addiction.</p><p>Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Benzodiazepines are often sought by individuals who abuse drugs and other substances, and by individuals with addictive disorders <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)]</span> .</p><p>The following adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: abdominal pain, amnesia, anorexia, anxiety, aggression, ataxia, blurred vision, confusion, depression, disinhibition, disorientation, dizziness, euphoria, impaired concentration and memory, indigestion, irritability, muscle pain, slurred speech, tremors, and vertigo.</p><p>The following severe adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: delirium, paranoia, suicidal ideation and behavior, seizures, coma, breathing difficulty, and death. Death is more often associated with polysubstance use (especially benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants such as opioids and alcohol).</p><h3>9.3 Dependence</h3><p class="First">Physical Dependence<br/>
DORAL may produce physical dependence from continued therapy. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of benzodiazepines or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening. Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e., higher and/or more frequent doses) and those who have had longer durations of use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)]</span> .</p><p>To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue DORAL or reduce the dosage <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)]</span> .</p><p><span class="Italics">Acute Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms</span><br/>
Acute withdrawal signs and symptoms have included abnormal involuntary movements, anxiety, blurred vision, depersonalization, depression, derealization, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal adverse reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, decreased appetite), headache, hyperacusis, hypertension, irritability, insomnia, memory impairment, muscle pain and stiffness, panic attacks, photophobia, restlessness, tachycardia, and tremor. More severe acute withdrawal signs and symptoms, including life-threatening reactions, have included catatonia, convulsions, delirium tremens, depression, hallucinations, mania, psychosis, and suicidality.</p><p><span class="Italics">Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome</span><br/>
Protracted withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines is characterized by anxiety, cognitive impairment, depression, insomnia, formication, motor symptoms (e.g., weakness, tremor, muscle twitches), paresthesia, and tinnitus that persists beyond 4 to 6 weeks after initial benzodiazepine withdrawal. Protracted withdrawal symptoms may last weeks to more than 12 months. As a result, there may be difficulty in differentiating withdrawal symptoms from potential re-emergence or continuation of symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was being used.</p><p>Tolerance<br/>
Tolerance to DORAL may develop from continued therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance may develop within days or weeks of the therapeutic effects of DORAL; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Contact a poison control center for up-to-date information on the management of benzodiazepine overdose.</p><p>Manifestations of DORAL overdose include somnolence, confusion, and coma. General supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate gastric lavage. Dialysis is of limited value. Flumazenil may be useful, but can contribute to the appearance of neurological symptoms including convulsions. Hypotension may be treated by appropriate medical intervention. Animal experiments suggest that forced diuresis or hemodialysis are of little value in treating DORAL overdose. As with the management of intentional overdose with any drug, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.</p><h2>Doral Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">DORAL contains quazepam, a trifluoroethyl benzodiazepine hypnotic agent, having the chemical name 7-chloro-5- (o-fluoro-phenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-(2,2,2- trifluoroethyl)-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-thione and the following structural</p><p></p><p>Quazepam has the empirical formula C <span class="Sub">17</span>H <span class="Sub">11</span>ClF <span class="Sub">4</span>N <span class="Sub">2</span>S, and a molecular weight of 386.8. It is a white crystalline compound, soluble in ethanol and insoluble in water.</p><p>Each DORAL Tablet contains 15 mg of quazepam. The inactive ingredients for Doral Tablets include cellulose, corn starch, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6, lactose, magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide, and sodium lauryl sulfate.</p><h2>Doral Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">DORAL, like other central nervous system agents of the 14-benzodiazepine class, presumably exerts its effects by binding to stereo-specific receptors at several sites within the central nervous system (CNS). The exact mechanism of action is unknown.</p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>DORAL is rapidly (absorption half-life of about 30 minutes) and well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The peak plasma concentration of quazepam is approximately 20 ng/mL after a 15 mg dose and occurs at about 2 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Quazepam, the active parent compound, is extensively metabolized in the liver; two of the plasma metabolites are 2-oxoquazepam and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam. All three compounds show CNS depressant activity.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The degree of plasma protein binding for quazepam and its two major metabolites is greater than 95%.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Following administration of 14C-quazepam, 31% of the dose appeared in the urine and 23% in the feces over five days; only trace amounts of unchanged drug were present in the urine.</p><p>The mean elimination half-life of quazepam and 2-oxoquazepam is 39 hours and that of N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam is 73 hours. Steady-state levels of quazepam and 2-oxoquazepam are attained by the seventh daily dose and that of N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam by the thirteenth daily dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Geriatrics:</span> The pharmacokinetics of quazepam and 2-oxoquazepam in geriatric subjects are comparable to those seen in young adults; as with desalkyl metabolites of other benzodiazepines, the elimination half-life of N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam in geriatric patients is about twice that of young adults.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>Bupropion (a CYP2B6 substrate): Co-administration of a single dose of 150 mg Bupropion Hydrochloride XL with steady state quazepam did not significantly affect the AUC and Cmax of bupropion or its primary metabolite, hydroxybupropion.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>DORAL showed no evidence of carcinogenicity in oral carcinogenicity studies in mice and hamsters.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>DORAL was negative in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and equivocal in the mouse lymphoma tk assay.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Reproduction studies in mice conducted with DORAL at doses equal to 60 and</p><p>180 times the human dose of 15 mg produced slight reductions in fertility rate. Similar reductions in fertility rate have been reported in mice dosed with other benzodiazepines, and is believed to be related to the sedative effects of these drugs at high doses</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The effectiveness of DORAL was established in placebo-controlled clinical studies of 5 nights duration in acute and chronic insomnia. The sustained effectiveness of DORAL was established in chronic insomnia in a sleep laboratory (polysomnographic) study of 28 nights duration. In the sleep laboratory study, DORAL significantly decreased sleep latency and total wake time, and significantly increased total sleep time and percent sleep time, for one or more nights.</p><p>DORAL 15 mg was effective on the first night of administration. Sleep latency, total wake time and wake time after sleep onset were still decreased and percent sleep time was still increased for several nights after the drug was discontinued. Percent slow wave sleep was decreased, and REM sleep was essentially unchanged. No transient sleep disturbance, such as “rebound insomnia,” was observed after withdrawal of the drug in sleep laboratory studies in 12 patients using 15 mg doses.</p><p>A double-blind, controlled sleep laboratory study (N=30) in elderly patients compared the effects of DORAL 7.5 mg and 15 mg to that of placebo over a period of 7 days. Both the 7.5 mg and 15 mg doses appeared to be effective. Caution must be used in interpreting this data due to the small size of the study.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED / STORAGE AND HANDLING</h2><p class="First">Doral Tablets, 15 mg, functionally scored, capsule-shaped, light orange, slightly white speckled tablets, impressed with the product identification number 15 on one side of the tablet, and the product name (DORAL) on the other.</p><p>Store Doral Tablets at controlled room temperature 20°-25°C (68°-77°F).</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide).</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids</span><br/>
Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if DORAL is used with opioids and not to use such drugs concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1), Drug Interactions ( 7)]</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction</span><br/>
Inform patients that the use of DORAL even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2) and Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.2)]</span> .</p><p><span class="Bold">Withdrawal Reactions</span><br/>
Inform patients that the continued use of DORAL may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of DORAL may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. Inform patients that in some cases, patients have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients that discontinuation or dosage reduction of DORAL may require a slow taper <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3)]</span> .</p><p><span class="Bold">CNS Depressant Effects and Next-Day Impairment</span><br/>
Tell patients that DORAL can cause next-day impairment, even in the absence of symptoms. Caution patients against driving or engaging in other hazardous activities or activities requiring complete mental alertness when using DORAL. Tell patients that daytime impairment may persist for several days following discontinuation of DORAL. Advise patients that increased drowsiness and decreased consciousness may increase the risk of falls in some patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)]</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Severe Allergic Reactions</span><br/>
Inform patients that severe allergic reactions can occur from DORAL. Describe the signs/symptoms of these reactions and advise patients to seek medical attention immediately if these occur <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6)]</span> .</p><p><span class="Bold">Abnormal Thinking and Behavior Change</span><br/>
Instruct patients that sedative hypnotics can cause abnormal thinking and behavior change, including “sleep-driving” and other complex behaviors while not being fully awake (preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex).
