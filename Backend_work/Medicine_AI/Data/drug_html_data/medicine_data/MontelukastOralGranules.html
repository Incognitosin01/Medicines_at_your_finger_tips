</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Neuropsychiatric Events</h3><p class="First">Serious neuropsychiatric (NP) events have been reported with use of montelukast sodium. These postmarketing reports have been highly variable and included, but were not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering), hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thoughts and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor. NP events have been reported in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients with and without a previous history <span class="following_xmChange">of</span> psychiatric disorder. NP events have been reported mostly during montelukast sodium treatment, but some were reported after montelukast sodium discontinuation. Animal studies showed that montelukast distributes into the brain in rats <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>; however, the mechanisms underlying montelukast sodium-associated NP events are currently not well understood. Based upon the available data, it is difficult to identify risk factors for or quantify the risk of NP events with montelukast sodium use.</p><p>Because of the risk of NP events, the benefits of montelukast sodium may not outweigh the risks in some patients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may be mild and adequately treated with alternative therapies. Reserve use of montelukast sodium <span class="following_xmChange">for</span> patients with allergic rhinitis who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.3)]</span>. In patients with asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, consider the benefits and risks before prescribing montelukast sodium.</p><p>Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium use with patients and caregivers when prescribing montelukast sodium. Advise patients and/or caregivers to be alert for changes in behavior or for new NP symptoms when taking montelukast sodium. If changes in behavior are observed, or if new NP symptoms or suicidal thoughts and/or behavior occur, advise patients to discontinue montelukast sodium and contact a healthcare provider immediately. <span class="following_xmChange">In</span> many cases, symptoms resolved after stopping montelukast sodium therapy; however, in some cases symptoms persisted after discontinuation of montelukast sodium. Therefore, continue to monitor and provide supportive care until symptoms resolve. Re-evaluate the benefits and risks of restarting treatment with montelukast sodium if such events occur<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Acute Asthma</h3><p class="First">Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist.</p><h3>Concomitant Corticosteroid Use</h3><p class="First">While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, montelukast sodium should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids.</p><h3>Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti­-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium. Although montelukast sodium is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Eosinophilic Conditions</h3><p class="First">Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal association between montelukast sodium and these underlying conditions has not been established <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the following description of clinical trials experience, adverse reactions are listed regardless of causality assessment.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and greater than placebo; listed in descending order of frequency) in controlled clinical trials were: upper respiratory infection, fever, headache, pharyngitis, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, otitis media, influenza, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma</span></p><p>Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in approximately 2950 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse experiences reported with montelukast sodium occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of patients and at an incidence greater than that in patients treated with placebo: </p><p>The frequency of less common adverse events was comparable between montelukast sodium and placebo.</p><p>Cumulatively, 569 patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, 480 for one year, and 49 for two years in clinical trials. With prolonged treatment, the adverse experience profile did not significantly change.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients 6 to 14 Years of Age with Asthma</span></p><p>Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 476 pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age. Cumulatively, 289 pediatric patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, and 241 for one year or longer in clinical trials. The safety profile of montelukast sodium in the 8-week, double-blind, pediatric efficacy trial was generally similar to the adult safety profile. In pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age receiving montelukast sodium, the following events occurred with a frequency ≥2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo: pharyngitis, influenza, fever, sinusitis, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, otitis, viral infection, and laryngitis. The frequency of less common adverse events was comparable between montelukast sodium and placebo. With prolonged treatment, the adverse experience profile did not significantly change.</p><p>In studies evaluating growth rate, the safety profile in these pediatric patients was consistent with the safety profile previously described for montelukast sodium. In a 56-week, double-blind study evaluating growth rate in pediatric patients 6 to 8 years of age receiving montelukast sodium, the following events not previously observed with the use of montelukast sodium in this age group occurred with a frequency ≥2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo: headache, rhinitis (infective), varicella, gastroenteritis, atopic dermatitis, acute bronchitis, tooth infection, skin infection, and myopia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients 2 to 5 Years of Age with Asthma</span></p><p>Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 573 pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age in single- and multiple-dose studies. Cumulatively, 426 pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 3 months, 230 for 6 months or longer, and 63 patients for one year or longer in clinical trials. In pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age receiving montelukast sodium, the following events occurred with a frequency ≥2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo: fever, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis, influenza, rash, ear pain, gastroenteritis, eczema, urticaria, varicella, pneumonia, dermatitis, and conjunctivitis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients 6 to 23 Months of Age with Asthma</span></p><p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 12 months of age with asthma have not been established.</p><p>Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 175 pediatric patients 6 to 23 months of age. The safety profile of montelukast sodium in a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study was generally similar to the safety profile in adults and pediatric patients 2 to 14 years of age. In pediatric patients 6 to 23 months of age receiving montelukast sodium, the following events occurred with a frequency ≥2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo: upper respiratory infection, wheezing; otitis media; pharyngitis, tonsillitis, cough; and rhinitis. The frequency of less common adverse events was comparable between montelukast sodium and placebo.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis</span></p><p>Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 2199 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. Montelukast sodium administered once daily in the morning or in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following event was reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: upper respiratory infection, 1.9% of patients receiving montelukast sodium vs. 1.5% of patients receiving placebo. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled clinical study, the safety profile was consistent with that observed in 2-week studies. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo in all studies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients 2 to 14 Years of Age with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis  </span></p><p>Montelukast sodium has been evaluated in 280 pediatric patients 2 to 14 years of age in a 2-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group safety study. Montelukast sodium administered once daily in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In this study, the following events occurred with a frequency ≥2% and at an incidence greater than placebo: headache, otitis media, pharyngitis, and upper respiratory infection.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis</span></p><p>Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 3357 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium in two, 6-week, clinical studies. Montelukast sodium administered once daily had a safety profile consistent with that observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and similar to that of placebo. In these two studies, the following events were reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, sinus headache, cough, epistaxis, and increased ALT. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients 6 Months</span><span class="Bold"> </span> <span class="Bold">to 14 Years of Age with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis</span></p><p>The safety in patients 2 to 14 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis is supported by the safety in patients 2 to 14 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The safety in patients 6 to 23 months of age is supported by data from pharmacokinetic and safety and efficacy studies in asthma in this pediatric population and from adult pharmacokinetic studies.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of montelukast sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Blood and lymphatic system disorders: increased bleeding tendency, thrombocytopenia.</p><p>Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, hepatic eosinophilic infiltration.</p><p>Psychiatric disorders: including, but not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering), hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thinking and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>Nervous system disorders: drowsiness, paraesthesia/hypoesthesia, seizures.</p><p>Cardiac disorders: palpitations.</p><p> </p><p>Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: epistaxis, pulmonary eosinophilia.</p><p>Gastrointestinal disorders: diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, pancreatitis, vomiting.</p><p> </p><p>Hepatobiliary disorders: Cases of cholestatic hepatitis, hepatocellular liver-injury, and mixed-pattern liver injury have been reported in patients treated with montelukast sodium. Most of these occurred in combination with other confounding factors, such as use of other medications, or when montelukast sodium was administered to patients who had underlying potential for liver disease such as alcohol use or other forms of hepatitis.</p><p>Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: angioedema, bruising, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria.</p><p>Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, myalgia including muscle cramps.</p><p>Renal and urinary disorders: enuresis in children.</p><p>General disorders and administration site conditions: edema.</p><p>Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">No dose adjustment is needed when montelukast sodium is co-administered with theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives, terfenadine, digoxin, warfarin, gemfibrozil, itraconazole, thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, decongestants, and Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme inducers <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available data from published prospective and retrospective cohort studies over decades with montelukast use in pregnant women have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of montelukast to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 100 and 110 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily oral dose (MRHDOD) based on AUC<span class="Sub">s</span> <span class="Italics">[see Data].</span></p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes.

Data available on the effects of the drug on infants, either directly <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span> or through breast milk, do not suggest a significant risk of adverse events from exposure to montelukast sodium. The effects of the drug on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for montelukast sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from montelukast sodium or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of montelukast sodium have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Special Populations (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>.</p><p>The efficacy of montelukast sodium for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 2 to 14 years of age and for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 6 months to 14 years of age is supported by extrapolation from the demonstrated efficacy in patients 15 years of age and older with allergic rhinitis as well as the assumption that the disease course, pathophysiology and the drug’s effect are substantially similar among these populations.</p><p>The safety of montelukast sodium 4 mg oral granules in pediatric patients 12 to 23 months of age with asthma has been demonstrated in an analysis of 172 pediatric patients, 124 of whom were treated with montelukast sodium, in a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> Efficacy of montelukast sodium in this age group is extrapolated from the demonstrated efficacy in patients 6 years of age and older with asthma based on similar mean systemic exposure (AUC), and that the disease course, pathophysiology and the drug's effect are substantially similar among these populations, supported by efficacy data from a safety trial in which efficacy was an exploratory assessment.</p><p>The safety of montelukast sodium 4 mg oral granules in pediatric patients as young as 6 months of age with perennial allergic rhinitis is supported by extrapolation from safety data obtained from studies conducted in pediatric patients 6 months to 23 months of age with asthma and from pharmacokinetic data comparing systemic exposures in patients 6 months to 23 months of age to systemic exposures in adults.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 months with asthma, 6 months with perennial allergic rhinitis have not been established.</p><p><span class="Bold">Growth Rate in Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>A 56-week, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, active- and placebo-controlled parallel group study was conducted to assess the effect of montelukast sodium on growth rate in 360 patients with mild asthma, aged 6 to 8 years. Treatment groups included montelukast 5 mg once daily, placebo, and beclomethasone dipropionate administered as 168 mcg twice daily with a spacer device. For each subject, a growth rate was defined as the slope of a linear regression line fit to the height measurements over 56 weeks. The primary comparison was the difference in growth rates between montelukast sodium and placebo groups. Growth rates, expressed as least-squares (LS) mean (95% CI) in cm/year, for the montelukast sodium, placebo, and beclomethasone treatment groups were 5.67 (5.46, 5.88), 5.64 (5.42, 5.86), and 4.86 (4.64, 5.08), respectively. The differences in growth rates, expressed as least-squares (LS) mean (95% CI) in cm/year, for montelukast sodium minus placebo, beclomethasone minus placebo, and montelukast sodium minus beclomethasone treatment groups were 0.03 (-0.26, 0.31), -0.78 (-1.06, -0.49); and 0.81 (0.53, 1.09), respectively. Growth rate (expressed as mean change in height over time) for each treatment group is shown in FIGURE 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Change in Height (cm) from Randomization Visit by Scheduled Week (Treatment Group Mean ± Standard Error* of the Mean)<br/>

</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of montelukast, 3.5% were 65 years of age and over, and 0.4% were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10 mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.</p><h3>Hepatic Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Renal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with montelukast sodium. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required. It is not known whether montelukast is removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.</p><h2>Montelukast Oral Granules Description</h2><p class="First">Montelukast sodium, the active ingredient in montelukast sodium oral granules USP, is a selective and orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist that inhibits the cysteinyl leukotriene CysLT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor.</p><p>Montelukast sodium is described chemically as [<span class="Italics">R</span>-(<span class="Italics">E</span>)]-1-[[[1-[3-[2-(7-chloro-2­-quinolinyl)ethenyl]phenyl]-3-[2-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)phenyl]propyl]thio]methyl]</p><p>cyclopropaneacetic acid, monosodium salt.</p><p>The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">35</span>H<span class="Sub">35</span>ClNNaO<span class="Sub">3</span>S, and its molecular weight is 608.18.

</p><p>Montelukast sodium is a hygroscopic, optically active, white or almost white powder. Montelukast sodium is soluble in water, methanol, ethanol and practically insoluble in acetonitrile.</p><p>Each packet of montelukast sodium 4 mg oral granules USP contains 4.2 mg montelukast sodium USP, which is equivalent to 4 mg of montelukast. The oral granule formulation contains the following inactive ingredients: hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, and mannitol.</p><h2>Montelukast Oral Granules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC<span class="Sub">4</span>, LTD<span class="Sub">4</span>, LTE<span class="Sub">4</span>) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors. The CysLT type-1 (CysLT<span class="Sub">1</span>) receptor is found in the human airway (including airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages) and on other pro-inflammatory cells (including eosinophils and certain myeloid stem cells). CysLTs have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis. In asthma, leukotriene-mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure during both early- and late-phase reactions and are associated with symptoms of allergic rhinitis.</p><p>Montelukast is an orally active compound that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor (in preference to other pharmacologically important airway receptors, such as the prostanoid, cholinergic, or β-adrenergic receptor). Montelukast inhibits physiologic actions of LTD<span class="Sub">4</span> at the CysLT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor without any agonist activity.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD<span class="Sub">4</span> in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD<span class="Sub">4</span>-induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12), montelukast sodium inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively.</p><p>The effect of montelukast sodium on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients, over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of montelukast sodium.
