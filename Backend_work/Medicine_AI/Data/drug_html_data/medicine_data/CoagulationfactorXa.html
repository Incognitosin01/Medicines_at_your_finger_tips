Reversing anticoagulant medicine is necessary if you have uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding as a result of how that medicine works.</p><p>Coagulation factor Xa is used to treat uncontrolled bleeding in people who take the anticoagulants rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and apixaban (Eliquis).</p><p>Coagulation factor Xa was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on an "accelerated" basis. In clinical studies, healthy volunteers responded to  coagulation factor Xa, but further studies are needed.</p><p>Coagulation factor Xa may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>This medicine is used to reverse the effects of anticoagulant medication, which may increase your risk of a blood clot, heart attack, stroke, or death.
