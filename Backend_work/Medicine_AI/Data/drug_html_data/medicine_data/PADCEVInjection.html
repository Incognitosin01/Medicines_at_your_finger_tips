The incidence of Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia increased consistently in patients with higher body mass index and in patients with higher baseline A1C. In EV-201, 8% of patients developed Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia. In this trial, patients with baseline hemoglobin A1C ≥8% were excluded. Closely monitor blood glucose levels in patients with, or at risk for, diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. If blood glucose is elevated (&gt;250 mg/dL), withhold PADCEV <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Peripheral Neuropathy</h3><p class="First">Peripheral neuropathy, predominantly sensory, occurred in 49% of the 310 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials; 2% experienced Grade 3 reactions.</p><p>In study EV-201, peripheral neuropathy occurred in patients treated with PADCEV with or without preexisting peripheral neuropathy. The median time to onset of Grade ≥2 was 3.8 months (range: 0.6 to 9.2). Neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation in 6% of patients. At the time of their last evaluation, 19% had complete resolution, and 26% had partial improvement.</p><p>Monitor patients for symptoms of new or worsening peripheral neuropathy and consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV when peripheral neuropathy occurs. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients that develop Grade <span class="Bold">&gt;</span>3 peripheral neuropathy <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Ocular Disorders</h3><p class="First">Ocular disorders occurred in 46% of the 310 patients treated with PADCEV. The majority of these events involved the cornea and included keratitis, blurred vision, limbal stem cell deficiency and other events associated with dry eyes.</p><p>Dry eye symptoms occurred in 36% of patients, and blurred vision occurred in 14% of patients, during treatment with PADCEV. The median time to onset to symptomatic ocular disorder was 1.9 months (range: 0.3 to 6.2).</p><p>Monitor patients for ocular disorders. Consider artificial tears for prophylaxis of dry eyes and ophthalmologic evaluation if ocular symptoms occur or do not resolve. Consider treatment with ophthalmic topical steroids, if indicated after an ophthalmic exam. Consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV for symptomatic ocular disorders.</p><h3>Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">Skin reactions occurred in 54% of the 310 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials. Twenty-six percent (26%) of patients had maculopapular rash and 30% had pruritus. Grade 3-4 skin reactions occurred in 10% of patients and included symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE), bullous dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.</p><p>In study EV-201, the median time to onset of severe skin reactions was 0.8 months (range: 0.2 to 5.3). Of the patients who experienced rash, 65% had complete resolution and 22% had partial improvement.</p><p>Monitor patients for skin reactions. Consider appropriate treatment, such as topical corticosteroids and antihistamines for skin reactions, as clinically indicated. For severe (Grade 3) skin reactions, withhold PADCEV until improvement or resolution and administer appropriate medical treatment. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients that develop Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 skin reactions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Infusion Site Extravasation</h3><p class="First">Skin and soft tissue reactions secondary to extravasation have been observed after administration of PADCEV. Of the 310 patients, 1.3% of patients experienced skin and soft tissue reactions. Reactions may be delayed. Erythema, swelling, increased temperature, and pain worsened until 2-7 days after extravasation and resolved within 1-4 weeks of peak. One percent of patients developed extravasation reactions with secondary cellulitis, bullae, or exfoliation. Ensure adequate venous access prior to starting PADCEV and monitor for possible extravasation during administration. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion and monitor for adverse reactions.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of enfortumab vedotin to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused maternal toxicity, embryo-fetal lethality, structural malformations and skeletal anomalies at maternal exposures approximately similar to the clinical exposures at the recommended human dose of 1.25 mg/kg.</p><p>Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 2 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 4 months after the last dose <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure to PADCEV as a single agent at 1.25 mg/kg in 310 patients in EV-201, EV-101 (NCT02091999), and EV-102 (NCT03219333). Among 310 patients receiving PADCEV, 30% were exposed for <span class="Bold">&gt;</span> 6 months and 8% were exposed for ≥12 months.</p><p>The data described in this section reflect exposure to PADCEV from EV-201, a single arm study in patients (n=125) with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who had received prior treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients received PADCEV 1.25 mg/kg on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of exposure to PADCEV was 4.6 months (range: 0.5-15.6).</p><p>Serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% of patients treated with PADCEV. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥3%) were urinary tract infection (6%), cellulitis (5%), febrile neutropenia (4%), diarrhea (4%), sepsis (3%), acute kidney injury (3%), dyspnea (3%), and rash (3%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.2% of patients, including acute respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, cardiac disorder, and sepsis (each 0.8%).</p><p>Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation occurred in 16% of patients; the most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was peripheral neuropathy (6%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption occurred in 64% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption were peripheral neuropathy (18%), rash (9%) and fatigue (6%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 34% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to dose reduction were peripheral neuropathy (12%), rash (6%) and fatigue (4%).</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, decreased appetite, rash, alopecia, nausea, dysgeusia, diarrhea, dry eye, pruritus and dry skin.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or other enfortumab vedotin products may be misleading.</p><p>A total of 365 patients were tested for immunogenicity to PADCEV; 4 patients (1%) were confirmed to be transiently positive for anti-therapeutic antibody (ATA), and 1 patient (0.3%) was confirmed to be persistently positive for ATA at any post-baseline time point. No impact of ATA on efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics was observed.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Effects of Other Drugs on PADCEV</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors</span><br/>
Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor may increase free MMAE exposure <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>, which may increase the incidence or severity of PADCEV toxicities. Closely monitor patients for signs of toxicity when PADCEV is given concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]</span>. There are no available human data on PADCEV use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In an animal reproduction study, administration ofenfortumab vedotin-ejfv to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused maternal toxicity, embryo-fetal lethality, structural malformations and skeletal anomalies at maternal exposures approximately similar to the exposures at the recommended human dose of 1.25 mg/kg <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Italics">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In a rat pilot embryo-fetal development study, administration of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv on gestation day 6 and 13 during the period of organogenesis resulted in a complete litter loss in all pregnant rats at the maternally toxic dose of 5 mg/kg (approximately 3 times the exposure at the recommended human dose). A dose of 2 mg/kg (approximately similar to the exposure at the recommended human dose) resulted in maternal toxicity, embryo-fetal lethality and structural malformations that included gastroschisis, malrotated hindlimb, absent forepaw, malpositioned internal organs and fused cervical arch. Additionally, skeletal anomalies (asymmetric, fused, incompletely ossified, and misshapen sternebrae, misshapen cervical arch, and unilateral ossification of the thoracic centra) and decreased fetal weight were observed.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with PADCEV and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy testing</span></p><p>Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating PADCEV treatment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Contraception</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Females</span></p><p>PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Avoid the use of PADCEV in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. PADCEV has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. In another ADC that contains MMAE, the frequency of ≥ Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. No adjustment in the starting dose is required when administering PADCEV to patients with mild hepatic impairment.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (CrCL &gt;60-90 mL/min), moderate (CrCL 30-60 mL/min) or severe (CrCL &lt;30 mL/min) renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>PADCEV Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is a Nectin-4 directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of a fully human anti-Nectin-4 IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody (AGS-22C3) conjugated to the small molecule microtubule disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease-cleavable maleimidocaproyl valine-citrulline (vc) linker (SGD-1006). Conjugation takes place on cysteine residues that comprise the interchain disulfide bonds of the antibody to yield a product with a drug-to-antibody ratio of approximately 3.8:1. The molecular weight is approximately 152 kDa.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1. Structural Formula</span></p><p>Approximately 4 molecules of MMAE are attached to each antibody molecule. Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis.</p><p>PADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) for injection is provided as a sterile, preservative-free, white to off-white lyophilized powder in single-dose vials for intravenous use. PADCEV is supplied as a 20 mg per vial and a 30 mg per vial and requires reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, (2.3 mL and 3.3 mL, respectively) resulting in a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution with a final concentration of 10 mg/mL <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].</span> After reconstitution, each vial allows the withdrawal of 2 mL (20 mg) and 3 mL (30 mg). Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 10 mg of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv, histidine (1.4 mg), histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (2.31 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.2 mg) and trehalose dihydrate (55 mg) with a pH of 6.0.</p><h2>PADCEV Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is an ADC. The antibody is a human IgG1 directed against Nectin-4, an adhesion protein located on the surface of cells. The small molecule, MMAE, is a microtubule-disrupting agent, attached to the antibody via a protease-cleavable linker. Nonclinical data suggest that the anticancer activity of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is due to the binding of the ADC to Nectin-4-expressing cells, followed by internalization of the ADC-Nectin-4 complex, and the release of MMAE via proteolytic cleavage. Release of MMAE disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In an exposure-response analysis, higher enfortumab vedotin exposure was associated with higher incidence of some adverse reactions (e.g., Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy, Grade ≥3 hyperglycemia) and a lower exposure was associated with lower efficacy.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>At the recommended dose, PADCEV had no large QTc prolongation (&gt;20 msec).</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Population pharmacokinetic analysis included data from 369 patients based on three Phase 1 studies and one Phase 2 study. Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv pharmacokinetics were characterized after single and multiple doses in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma and other solid tumors.</p><p>The exposure parameters of ADC and unconjugated MMAE (the cytotoxic component of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) are summarized in Table 5 below. Peak ADC concentrations were observed near the end of intravenous infusion while peak MMAE concentrations were observed approximately 2 days after enfortumab vedotin-ejfv dosing. Minimal accumulation of the ADC and MMAE was observed following repeat administration of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv in patients. Steady-state concentrations of ADC and MMAE were reached after 1 treatment cycle.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ADC</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Mean (± SD)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Unconjugated MMAE</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Mean (± SD)</span></p><p class="First">C<span class="Sub">max</span></p><p class="First">28 (6.8) µg/mL</p><p class="First">4.8 (2.7) ng/mL</p><p class="First">AUC<span class="Sub">0-28d</span></p><p class="First">111 (38) µg∙d/mL</p><p class="First">69 (42) ng∙d/mL</p><p class="First">C<span class="Sub">trough,0-28d</span></p><p class="First">0.27 (0.22) µg/mL</p><p class="First">0.57 (0.58) ng/mL</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>The estimated mean steady-state volume of distribution of ADC was 11 liters following administration of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv. Plasma protein binding of MMAE ranged from 68% to 82%, in vitro.</p><p><span class="Italics">Elimination</span></p><p>ADC and MMAE exhibited multi-exponential declines with an elimination half-life of 3.4 days and 2.4 days, respectively. The mean clearance (CL) of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv and free MMAE in patients was 0.10 L/h and 2.7 L/h, respectively, in patients. Elimination of MMAE appeared to be limited by its rate of release from enfortumab vedotin-ejfv.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv catabolism has not been studied in humans; however, it is expected to undergo catabolism to small peptides, amino acids, unconjugated MMAE, and unconjugated MMAE-related catabolites. Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv releases MMAE via proteolytic cleavage, and MMAE is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>The excretion of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is not fully characterized. Following a single-dose of another ADC that contains MMAE, 17% of the total MMAE administered was recovered in feces and 6% in urine over a 1-week period, primarily as unchanged drug. A similar excretion profile of MMAE is expected after enfortumab vedotin-ejfv administration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv were observed based on age (24 to 87 years), sex, or race/ethnicity (Caucasian, Asian, Black, or others).</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Based on population pharmacokinetics analysis, there was a 48% AUC increase in unconjugated MMAE exposure observed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin of 1 to 1.5 × ULN and AST &lt;ULN, or bilirubin ≤ULN and AST &gt;ULN, n=31) compared to normal hepatic function. The effect of moderate or severe hepatic impairment (AST or ALT &gt;2.5 x ULN or total bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN) or liver transplantation on the pharmacokinetics of ADC or unconjugated MMAE is unknown.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv and MMAE were evaluated after the administration of 1.25 mg/kg of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv to patients with mild (creatinine clearance; CrCL &gt;60–90 mL/min; n=135), moderate (CrCL 30–60 mL/min; n=147) and severe (CrCL &lt;30 mL/min; n=8) renal impairment. No significant differences in exposure (AUC) of ADC and MMAE were observed in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. The effect of end stage renal disease with or without dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of ADC or unconjugated MMAE is unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Clinical Studies</span></p><p>No clinical studies evaluating the drug-drug interaction potential of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv have been conducted. To characterize the drug-drug interaction potential of free MMAE, clinical studies with another ADC that contains MMAE are described below.</p><p><span class="Italics">Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors:</span> Another ADC that contains MMAE co-administered with ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased MMAE C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 25% and AUC by 34%, with no change in ADC exposure. The concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 with PADCEV would likely result in similar effects on free MMAE and ADC.</p><p><span class="Italics">Strong CYP3A4 Inducers:</span> Another ADC that contains MMAE co-administered with rifampin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) decreased MMAE C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 44% and AUC by 46%, with no change in ADC exposure. The concomitant use of strong inducers of CYP3A4 with PADCEV would likely result in similar effects on free MMAE and ADC.</p><p><span class="Italics">Sensitive CYP3A4 Substrates:</span> Another ADC that contains MMAE co-administered with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) did not affect the exposure of midazolam. Similarly, PADCEV is not expected to alter the exposure of drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes.</p><p><span class="Italics">In Vitro Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Transporter Systems:</span> MMAE is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but not an inhibitor of P-gp.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity studies with enfortumab vedotin-ejfv or the small molecule cytotoxic agent (MMAE) have not been conducted.</p><p>MMAE was genotoxic in the rat bone marrow micronucleus study through an aneugenic mechanism. This effect is consistent with the pharmacological effect of MMAE as a microtubule-disrupting agent. MMAE was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or the L5178Y mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay.</p><p>Fertility studies with enfortumab vedotin-ejfv or MMAE have not been conducted. However, results of repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats indicate the potential for enfortumab vedotin-ejfv to impair male reproductive function and fertility.</p><p>In repeat-dose toxicology studies conducted in rats for up to 13 weeks, doses ≥2 mg/kg enfortumab vedotin-ejfv (at exposures similar to the exposures at the recommended human dose) resulted in decreases in testes and epididymis weights, seminiferous tubule degeneration, spermatid/spermatocyte depletion in the testes and cell debris, sperm granuloma and hypospermia/abnormal spermatids in the epididymis. Findings in the testes and epididymis did not reverse by the end of the recovery period.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Metastatic Urothelial Cancer</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of PADCEV was evaluated in EV-201 (NCT03219333), single-arm, multicenter trial that enrolled 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who received prior treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were excluded if they had active CNS metastases, ongoing sensory or motor neuropathy ≥ Grade 2, or uncontrolled diabetes defined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ≥8% or HbA1c ≥7% with associated diabetes symptoms.</p><p>The median age was 69 years (range: 40 to 84 years), 70% were male, and 85% were Caucasian. All patients had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (32%) or 1 (68%). Ninety percent of patients had visceral metastases including 40% with liver metastases. Two-thirds of patients had pure transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) histology; 33% had TCC with other histologic variants. An immunohistochemistry clinical trial assay was used to assess patients with tumor tissue available, and detected Nectin-4 expression in all patients tested (n=120). The median number of prior systemic therapies was 3 (range: 1 to 6). Forty-six percent of patients received prior PD-1 inhibitor, 42% received prior PD-L1 inhibitor, and an additional 13% received both PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. Sixty-six percent of patients received prior cisplatin-based regimens, 26% received prior carboplatin-based regimens, and an additional 8% received both cisplatin and carboplatin-based regimens.</p><p>The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) using RECIST v1.1.</p><p>Efficacy results are presented in Table 6.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Endpoint</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PADCEV</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n=125</span>*</p><p class="First">Confirmed ORR</p><p>(95% CI)</p><p class="First">44%</p><p>(35.1, 53.2)</p><p class="First">   Complete Response Rate (CR)</p><p class="First">12%</p><p class="First">   Partial Response Rate (PR)</p><p class="First">32%</p><p class="First">Median† Duration of Response, months</p><p>(95% CI)</p><p class="First">7.6‡</p><p>(6.3, NE)</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First">PADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) 20 mg and 30 mg are supplied as a sterile, preservative-free, white to off-white lyophilized powder in single-dose vials.
