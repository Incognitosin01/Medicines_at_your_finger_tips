</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Bethkis Inhalation Solution</h2><p class="First">BETHKIS is indicated for the management of cystic fibrosis patients with <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>. Safety and efficacy have not been demonstrated in patients under the age of six years, patients with FEV <span class="Sub">1</span> less than 40% or greater than 80% predicted, or patients colonized with <span class="Italics">Burkholderia cepacia</span><span class="Italics"> [s</span><span class="Italics">ee Clinical Studies ( 14)]</span> .</p><h2>Bethkis Inhalation Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Bethkis is for oral inhalation <span class="Italics">only [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2)]</span> . The recommended dosage of BETHKIS for patients six years of age and older is to administer one single-use ampule (300 mg/4 mL) twice daily by oral inhalation in repeated cycles of 28 days on drug, followed by 28 days off drug.  The doses should be taken as close to 12 hours apart as possible and not less than 6 hours apart.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">The 300 mg/4 mL dose of BETHKIS is the same for patients regardless of age or weight. BETHKIS has not been studied in patients less than six years old.The 300 mg/4 mL dose of BETHKIS is the same for patients regardless of age or weight. BETHKIS has not been studied in patients less than six years old.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">If patients miss a dose, they should take it as soon as possible anytime up to 6 hours prior to their next scheduled dose. If less than 6 hours remain before the next dose, wait until their next scheduled dose.</span></p><h3>Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">BETHKIS is administered by oral inhalation using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a PARI Vios Air compressor over an approximately 15 minute period and until sputtering from the output of the nebulizer has occurred for at least one minute. BETHKIS should not be diluted or mixed with dornase alfa or other medications in the nebulizer. BETHKIS is <span class="Italics">not</span> for subcutaneous, intravenous, or intrathecal administration.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Further patient instructions on how to administer BETHKIS are provided in the <span class="Italics">Patient’s Instructions for Use [see Patient Counseling Information (</span><span class="Italics">17</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">BETHKIS should not be used if it is cloudy, if there are particles in the solution, or if it has been stored at room temperature for more than 28 days.</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">BETHKIS is supplied as a sterile, clear, colorless to pale yellow, non-pyrogenic, aqueous inhalational solution for nebulization in single-use 4 mL ampule containing 300 mg of tobramycin.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">BETHKIS is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Ototoxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Caution should be exercised when prescribing BETHKIS to patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction.  Caution should be exercised when prescribing BETHKIS to patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction. </span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Findings related to ototoxicity as measured by audiometric evaluations and auditory adverse event reports were similar between BETHKIS and placebo in controlled clinical trials.  Hearing loss was reported in two (1.1%) BETHKIS-treated patients and in one (0.9%) placebo-treated patient during clinical studies.  Additionally, dizziness and vertigo, both of which may be manifestations of vestibular forms of ototoxicity, were observed in similar numbers of BETHKIS- and placebo-treated patients.  Dizziness occurred in two (1.1%) BETHKIS-treated patients and one (0.9%) placebo-treated patient and vertigo occurred in two (1.1%) BETHKIS-treated patients versus no placebo patients in clinical studies.

None of the BETHKIS patients discontinued their therapy due to hearing loss, dizziness or vertigo.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity.  No reports of tinnitus occurred in patients during clinical studies with BETHKIS, but because it has been observed with inhaled tobramycin solutions <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2)]</span> , onset of this symptom warrants caution.  Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides.  Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking BETHKIS. Monitoring may include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing BETHKIS.</span></p><h3>Nephrotoxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Caution should be exercised when prescribing BETHKIS to patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction.Caution should be exercised when prescribing BETHKIS to patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Nephrotoxicity was not seen during BETHKIS clinical studies but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with BETHKIS should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing BETHKIS until serum concentrations fall below 2 mcg/mL.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Twenty-six (14%) BETHKIS patients and 15 (13%) placebo patients had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. Follow-up values were obtained for 17 of the 26 BETHKIS patients, all of which decreased to serum creatinine values that were within normal laboratory ranges. Patients who experience an increase in serum creatinine during treatment with BETHKIS should have their renal function closely monitored.Twenty-six (14%) BETHKIS patients and 15 (13%) placebo patients had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline.

Patients who experience an increase in serum creatinine during treatment with BETHKIS should have their renal function closely monitored.</span></p><h3>Neuromuscular Disorders</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">BETHKIS should be used cautiously in patients with muscular disorders. BETHKIS should be used cautiously in patients with muscular disorders.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson’s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary.</span></p><h3>Bronchospasm</h3><p class="First">Bronchospasm has been reported with inhalation of tobramycin. In clinical studies with BETHKIS, bronchospasm was observed in one (0.5%) BETHKIS-treated patient and in no placebo-treated patients. Wheezing occurred in ten (5%) BETHKIS-treated patients and four (4%) placebo-treated patients. Bronchospasm and wheezing should be treated as medically appropriate.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of inhaled tobramycin solutions did not identify hearing loss using audiometric tests which evaluated hearing up to 8000 Hz. Physicians should consider an audiogram for patients who show any evidence of auditory dysfunction, or who are at increased risk for auditory dysfunction. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants caution.</p><p class="First">In patients with normal renal function treated with BETHKIS, serum tobramycin concentrations range from approximately 0.06-1.89 mcg/mL one hour after dose administration and do not require routine monitoring. Serum concentrations of tobramycin in patients with renal dysfunction or patients treated with concomitant parenteral tobramycin should be monitored at the discretion of the treating physician <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]</span> .</p><p>The serum concentration of tobramycin should only be monitored through venipuncture and not finger prick blood sampling. Contamination of the skin of the fingers with tobramycin may lead to falsely increased measurements of serum levels of the drug. This contamination cannot be completely avoided by hand washing before testing.</p><p class="First">The clinical studies of BETHKIS did not reveal any imbalance in the percentage of patients who experienced at least a 50% rise in serum creatinine from baseline in either the BETHKIS group (n=26, 14%) or the placebo group (n=15, 13%). Laboratory tests of urine and renal function should be conducted at the discretion of the treating physician.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed <span class="Italics">in utero</span>. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]</span> . Patients who use BETHKIS during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking BETHKIS should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1)]</span> .</span></p><h3>Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Patients receiving concomitant BETHKIS and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored.</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of drugs cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to BETHKIS in two placebo-controlled studies in 305 cystic fibrosis patients. Patients receiving BETHKIS ranged in age from 6 to 31 years.</p><p>In Study 1, an eight week study, 29 patients received BETHKIS versus 30 patients who received placebo for a total of four weeks on drug and four weeks off drug.  All patients were ≤ 30 years of age (mean age 12.6 years) and 46% were females. 52.5% of patients were 6 to 12 years of age while 30.5% of patients were 13-17 years old. Only 16.5% of patients were adults (&gt; 17 years old). Eighty percent (80%) of patients were chronically colonized with <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> while 20.3% of patients were initially or intermittently colonized with <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> during the study.</p><p>More patients in the placebo group discontinued/dropped out of Study 1 than in the BETHKIS group (23% [7/30] vs 3.4% [1/29], respectively). Five patients in the placebo group compared to none in the BETHKIS group discontinued/dropped out because of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) such as pulmonary exacerbations and respiratory disorders.</p><p>In Study 2, a 24 week study, 161 patients received BETHKIS versus 85 patients who received placebo in alternating four week on-off cycles for three cycles. All patients were ≤ 46 years of age (mean age 14.8 years) and 45% were females. 41% of patients were 6-12 years old while 29% of patients were 13-17 years old. Only 30% were adults (&gt;17 years). Eighty-seven percent (87%) of patients were chronically colonized with <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span>. Only 13% were either initially or intermittently colonized with <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span> during the study.</p><p>More patients in the placebo group discontinued/dropped out of Study 2 than in the BETHKIS group (9.4% [8/85] vs 4.3% [7/161], respectively). Of these, 3 patients in the BETHKIS group (1.9%) compared to 2 patients in the placebo group (2.4%) withdrew due to a TEAE. The most common TEAEs causing patients to discontinue from the study drug are respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders.</p><p>The most common adverse experiences reported were respiratory disorders, consistent with the underlying disease in the patient population being evaluated and these were similarly distributed between both BETHKIS- and placebo-treated patients. The following adverse reactions were reported in at least 5% of Bethkis-treated patients and at rates ≥ 2% more common compared to the placebo-treated patients: decreased forced expiratory volume, rales, red blood cell sedimentation rate increased, and dysphonia (Table 1). <span class="Bold"><br/></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">BETHKIS<br/>

Therefore, BETHKIS should not be administered concomitantly with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or intravenous mannitol.  The interaction between inhaled mannitol and BETHKIS has not been evaluated.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6)]</span> . Although there are no available data on use of BETHKIS in pregnant women to be able to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]</span> . There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</span>. In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span> . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</span></p><p>Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>No reproduction toxicology studies have been conducted with inhaled tobramycin. However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Subcutaneous doses of tobramycin ≥ 40mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">There are no data on the presence of tobramycin in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production following oral inhalation of BETHKIS. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]</span> . Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</span>. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for BETHKIS and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BETHKIS or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p class="First">Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash).</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of BETHKIS have not been studied in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients under six years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of BETHKIS did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2,  5.5)]</span> .</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine and renal function is expected to affect the exposure of tobramycin. The risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Patients with serum creatinine &gt; 2mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) &gt; 40mg/dL have not been included in clinical studies and there are no data in this population to support a recommendation for or against dose adjustment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2, 5.5)]</span> .</p><p>Serum concentrations of tobramycin in patients with renal dysfunction, or patients treated with concomitant parenteral tobramycin should be monitored at the discretion of the treating physician.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">No overdoses have been reported with BETHKIS in clinical trials.  Signs and symptoms of acute toxicity from overdosage of intravenous tobramycin might include dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, loss of high-tone hearing acuity, respiratory failure, neuromuscular blockade, and renal impairment. Administration by inhalation results in low systemic bioavailability of tobramycin. Tobramycin is not significantly absorbed following oral administration. Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage.</p><p>In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. In the case of any overdosage, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered.</p><h2>Bethkis Inhalation Solution Description</h2><p class="First">BETHKIS is a sterile, clear, colorless to pale yellow, non-pyrogenic, aqueous solution with pH and salinity adjusted. BETHKIS is administered by a compressed air driven reusable nebulizer. The chemical formula for tobramycin is C <span class="Sub">18</span>H <span class="Sub">37</span>N <span class="Sub">5</span>O <span class="Sub">9</span> and the molecular weight is 467.52. Tobramycin is O-3-amino-3-deoxy-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-[2,6-diamino- 2,3,6-trideoxy-α-D-ribo-hexopyranosyl-(1→6)]-2-deoxy-L‑streptamine.</p><p>The structural formula for tobramycin is:</p><p>Each single-use 4 mL ampule of BETHKIS contains one 300 mg dose of tobramycin, with sodium chloride and sulfuric acid in water for injection. Sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide are used, as needed, to adjust the pH to 5.0. Nitrogen is used for sparging, filling and pouching. The formulation contains no preservatives.</p><h2>Bethkis Inhalation Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">BETHKIS is an aminoglycoside antibacterial <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.4)]</span> .</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">BETHKIS contains tobramycin, a cationic polar molecule that does not readily cross epithelial membranes. <span class="Sup">1</span> The bioavailability of BETHKIS may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. <span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">Thirty minutes after inhalation of the first 300 mg dose of BETHKIS, the maximum geometric mean concentration of tobramycin was 814 mcg/g (ranging from 23 to 2843 mcg/g) in sputum. High variability of tobramycin concentration in sputum was observed. Three hours after inhalation started, sputum tobramycin concentrations declined to approximately 15% of those observed at 30 minutes.  After four weeks of therapy with BETHKIS average mean sputum tobramycin concentrations obtained 10 minutes following administration were 717 mcg/g.</p><p class="First">Following administration of BETHKIS, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible.</p><p class="First">Tobramycin is not metabolized. The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately two hours after intravenous (IV) administration. The elimination half-life following the inhalation of BETHKIS is approximately 4.4 hours. Assuming tobramycin absorbed following inhalation behaves similarly to tobramycin following intravenous administration, systemically absorbed tobramycin is eliminated principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin following inhalation is likely eliminated in expectorated sputum. </p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">Tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibacterial, acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis in the bacterial cell which eventually leads to death of the cell. Tobramycin has activity against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria including <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span>. It is bactericidal at or above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed to inhibit growth of bacteria.</p><p class="First">The predominant mechanism of resistance to tobramycin in <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span> isolated from CF patients is impermeability and to a lesser extent enzymatic modification and other mechanisms which cumulatively lead to decreased susceptibility of <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span> to tobramycin.</p><p class="First">Cross resistance between aminoglycosides exists but the cross resistance is variable.</p><p class="First">Treatment for six months with BETHKIS in one clinical trial did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span> isolates tested; however, increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients.</p><p class="First">The clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative results of the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physicians as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens.

There was a slight increase in isolation of <span class="Italics">Candida spp</span> in sputum at the end of the BETHKIS treatment cycle in clinical trials.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">A two-year rat inhalation toxicology study to assess carcinogenic potential of an inhaled solution of tobramycin has been completed. Rats were exposed to tobramycin for up to 1.5 hours per day for 95 weeks. Serum levels of tobramycin up to 35 mcg/mL were measured in rats, 35x the average 1 mcg/mL exposure levels observed in cystic fibrosis patients in clinical trials. There was no drug-related increase in the incidence of any variety of tumors.</p><p>Additionally, tobramycin has been evaluated for genotoxicity in a battery of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> tests. The Ames bacterial reversion test, conducted with five tester strains, failed to show a significant increase in revertants with or without metabolic activation in all strains. Tobramycin was negative in the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, did not induce chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was negative in the mouse micronucleus test.</p><p>Subcutaneous administration of up to 100 mg/kg of tobramycin did not affect mating behavior or cause impairment of fertility in male or female rats.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Two, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2), which randomized and dosed 306 patients, were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span>. The osmolality of the drug formulation used in these studies differed from the to-be-marketed product. To rely upon the efficacy and safety established in the placebo-controlled studies, an additional study was conducted as a bridge to the to-be-marketed drug. The bridging study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of aerosolized Tobramycin Inhalation Solution with osmolality similar to BETHKIS over a 4-week treatment in 324 patients with cystic fibrosis. Results of this study showed that the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution in this study had similar efficacy as that seen in the placebo-controlled studies.</p><p>The compressors in the placebo-controlled studies and the bridging study differed from the PARI VIOS compressor to be used with BETHKIS. In vitro cascade impaction studies demonstrated that the various compressors used in the clinical trials delivered equivalent doses and respirable fractions of the to-be-marketed BETHKIS and TOBI with the marketed compressor (PARI VIOS) when used with the same nebulizer (PARI LC Plus Reusable nebulizer).</p><p>All subjects enrolled in both efficacy studies had baseline FEV <span class="Sub">1</span> % predicted ≥ 40% and ≤ 80% (mean baseline FEV <span class="Sub">1</span> of 60% of predicted normal) and infected with <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span>. Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, or who had a baseline creatinine of ≥ 1.5 mg/dL, or who had <span class="Italics">Burkholderia cepacia</span> isolated from sputum were excluded. A total of 190 patients, 29 in Study 1 and 161 in Study 2, received BETHKIS therapy on an outpatient basis. Of these, 55% were males and 45% were females. Eighty-two (43.2%) patients were between 6 and 12 years of age, 54 (28.4%) patients were between 13 and 17 years of age, and the remaining 54 (28.4%) patients were greater than 17 years of age. Of the patients who received BETHKIS, only 89.7% of patients in Study 1 had at least one concomitant medication, while all patients in Study 2 also received at least one concomitant medication. These concomitant medications include mucolytics, steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, bronchodilators, rehabilitative physiotherapies and if necessary, antibiotics for bacterial infections other than <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Study 1</span></p><p>Study 1 was a double-blind, single cycle study that randomized 59 patients to receive BETHKIS (n=29) or placebo (n=30) for one cycle of treatment (28 days on treatment followed by 28 days off treatment). All patients were ≤ 30 years of age (mean age 12.6 years) and 46% were females.

<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">BETHKIS is used only in a PARI LC PLUS re-usable Nebulizer connected to a PARI LC PLUS Vios air compressor. Make sure you know how to use your nebulizer machine before you use it to breathe in BETHKIS.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Do not</span> mix BETHKIS with other medicines in your nebulizer.</p><p>BETHKIS comes in a sealed foil pouch. Do not open a sealed pouch until you are ready to use a dose of BETHKIS. After opening the pouch, unused ready-to-use ampules should be returned to, and stored in, the pouch.</p><p><span class="Bold">Getting ready:</span></p><ul>
<li>Put your PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer Top and Bottom (Nebulizer Cup) Assembly, Inspiratory Valve Cap, Mouthpiece with Valve, and Tubing on a clean and dry surface.</li>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Preparing your BETHKIS dose:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 1:</span> Open foil pouch. (See Figure B)</p><p> </p><p>(Figure B)</p><p><span class="Bold">Step 2:</span> Separate 1 ampule by gently pulling apart at the bottom tabs (See Figure C) and use it right away.</p><p>(Figure C)<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 3:</span> Hold the bottom tab on the BETHKIS ampule with 1 hand (See Figure D). With your other hand, hold the top of the ampule and twist off the top of the ampule (See Figure D).</p><ul>
<li>Do not squeeze the ampule until you are ready to squeeze all the medicine into the Nebulizer Cup.</li>
</ul><p>(Figure D)<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 4:</span> Hold the Nebulizer Cup and twist off the Nebulizer Cup Top in a counter-clockwise direction (See Figure E). Set the Top aside on a clean, dry surface.</p><p>(Figure E)<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 5:</span> Squeeze all of the medicine from the ampule into the Nebulizer Cup (See Figure F).</p><p>(Figure F)<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 6:</span> Line up the semi-circle on the Nebulizer Cup Top with the Nebulizer Cup Outlet and twist on the Nebulizer Cup Top in a clock-wise direction until it is tight. (See Figure G).</p><p>(Figure G)<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 7:</span> Push the mouthpiece straight onto the Nebulizer Cup Outlet (See Figure H).</p><p>(Figure H)<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 8:</span> Firmly push the Inspiratory Valve Cap straight down onto the Nebulizer Cup Top (See Figure I). The Inspiratory Valve Cap should fit tightly.</p><p>(Figure I)<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 9:</span> Connect 1 end of the tubing to the compressor air outlet. The tubing should fit tightly (See Figure J).</p><p>(Figure J)<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 10:</span> Plug your compressor plug into an electrical outlet (See Figure K).</p><p>(Figure K)<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 11:</span> Hold the Nebulizer Cup upright and firmly push the free end of the tubing straight up onto the Air Intake on the bottom of the Nebulizer Cup (See Figure L). <span class="Bold">Make sure to keep the Nebulizer Cup upright.</span></p><p>(Figure L)<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Giving your BETHKIS dose:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 12:</span> Turn on the compressor (Figure M) and check the Mouthpiece. You should see a steady mist coming from the Mouthpiece (Figure N).</p><ul>
<li>If you do not see a steady mist coming from the mouthpiece, check all tubing connections and make sure that the compressor is working the right way.</li>
</ul><p>(Figure M)<br/>
<br/></p><p>(Figure N)<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 13:</span> Sit or stand in a comfortable, upright position that will let you breathe normally. Place the Mouthpiece between your teeth and on top of your tongue and breathe normally only through your mouth (See Figure O).</p><ul>
<li>Nose clips may help you breathe only through your mouth and not through your nose.</li>
</ul><p>(Figure O)<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 14:</span> Keep breathing in your BETHKIS dose for at least 15 minutes. You will know that you have received your full dose of medicine when you hear a “spitting noise” coming from the Mouthpiece for at least 1 minute and the Nebulizer Cup is empty.</p><p><span class="Bold">After your BETHKIS Dose:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 15:</span> Clean and disinfect your nebulizer (see manufacturer’s instructions).<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Care and Use of Your PARI Vios <span class="Sup">®</span> Compressor</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for care and use of your compressor.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">How should I store BETHKIS?</span></p><ul class="Disc">
