</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Cisatracurium Besylate Injection</h2><p class="First">Cisatracurium Besylate Injection is indicated:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>as an adjunct to general anesthesia to facilitate tracheal intubation in adults and in pediatric patients 1 month to 12 years of age</li>
<li>to provide skeletal muscle relaxation in adults during surgical procedures or during mechanical ventilation in the ICU</li>
<li>to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgical procedures via infusion in pediatric patients 2 years and older</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use<br/></span><br/>
Cisatracurium Besylate Injection is not recommended for rapid sequence endotracheal intubation due to the time required for its onset of action.</p><h2>Cisatracurium Besylate Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Important administration instructions include:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Cisatracurium Besylate Injection is for intravenous use only.</li>
<li>Administer Cisatracurium Besylate Injection in carefully adjusted dosage by or under the supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with the drug’s actions and the possible complications.</li>
<li>Use Cisatracurium Besylate Injection only if the following are immediately available: personnel and facilities for resuscitation and life support (tracheal intubation, artificial ventilation, oxygen therapy); and an antagonist of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>.</li>
<li>The dosage information which follows is intended to serve as an initial guide for individual patients; base subsequent Cisatracurium Besylate Injection dosage on the patients’ responses to the initial doses.</li>
<li>Use a peripheral nerve stimulator to:
<ul class="Disc">
<li>Determine the adequacy of neuromuscular blockade (e.g., need for additional Cisatracurium Besylate Injection doses, reduction of the infusion rate).</li>
<li>Minimize risk of overdosage or underdosage.</li>
<li>Assess the extent of recovery from neuromuscular blockade (e.g., spontaneous recovery or recovery after administration of a reversal agent, e.g., neostigmine).</li>
<li>Appropriately titrate doses to potentially limit exposure to toxic metabolites.</li>
<li>Facilitate more rapid reversal of the Cisatracurium Besylate Injection-induced paralysis.</li>

</ul><p><span class="Bold">Risk of Medication Errors</span></p><p>Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal. Store Cisatracurium Besylate Injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Recommended Cisatracurium Besylate Injection Dose for Performing Tracheal Intubation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tracheal Intubation in Adults<br/></span><br/>
Prior to selecting the initial Cisatracurium Besylate Injection bolus dose, consider the desired time to tracheal intubation and the anticipated length of surgery, factors affecting time to onset of complete neuromuscular block such as age and renal function, and factors that may influence intubation conditions such as the presence of co-induction agents (e.g., fentanyl and midazolam) and the depth of anesthesia.<br/>
<br/>
In conjunction with a propofol/nitrous oxide/oxygen induction-intubation technique or a thiopental/nitrous oxide/oxygen induction-intubation technique, the recommended starting weight-based dose of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection is between 0.15 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg administered by bolus intravenous injection. Doses up to 0.4 mg/kg have been safely administered by bolus intravenous injection to healthy patients and patients with serious cardiovascular disease <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Patients with Neuromuscular Disease<br/></span><br/>
The maximum recommended initial bolus dose of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection is 0.02 mg/kg in patients with neuromuscular diseases (e.g., myasthenia gravis and myasthenic syndrome and carcinomatosis) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Geriatric Patients and Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease<br/></span><br/>
Because the time to maximum neuromuscular blockade is approximately 1 minute slower in geriatric patients compared to younger patients (and in patients with end-stage renal disease than in patients with normal renal function), consider extending the interval between administering Cisatracurium Besylate Injection and attempting intubation by at least 1 minute to achieve adequate intubation conditions in geriatric patients and patients with end-stage renal disease. A peripheral nerve stimulator should be used to determine the adequacy of muscle relaxation for the purposes of intubation and the timing and amounts of subsequent doses <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Tracheal Intubation in Pediatric Patients<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Infants 1 to 23 Months of Age<br/></span><br/>
The recommended dose of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection for intubation of pediatric patients ages 1 month to 23 months is 0.15 mg/kg administered over 5 to 10 seconds. When administered during stable opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia, 0.15 mg/kg of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection produced maximum neuromuscular blockade in about 2 minutes (range: 1.3 to 4.3 minutes) with a clinically effective block (time to 25% recovery) for about 43 minutes (range: 34 to 58 minutes) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Pediatric Patients 2 to 12 Years of Age<br/></span><br/>
The recommended weight-based bolus dose of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection for pediatric patients 2 to 12 years of age is 0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg administered over 5 to 10 seconds. When administered during stable opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia, 0.1 mg/kg Cisatracurium Besylate Injection produced maximum neuromuscular blockade in an average of 2.8 minutes (range: 1.8 to 6.7 minutes) with a clinically effective block (time to 25% recovery) for 28 minutes (range: 21 to 38 minutes). When administered during stable opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia, 0.15 mg/kg Cisatracurium Besylate Injection produced maximum neuromuscular blockade in an average of about 3 minutes (range: 1.5 to 8 minutes) with a clinically effective block for 36 minutes (range: 29 to 46 minutes) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Recommended Maintenance Bolus Cisatracurium Besylate Injection Doses in Adult Surgical Procedures</h3><p class="First">Determine if maintenance bolus doses are needed based on clinical criteria including the response to peripheral nerve stimulation. The recommended maintenance bolus dose of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection is 0.03 mg/kg; however, smaller or larger maintenance doses may be administered based on the required duration of action. Administer the first maintenance bolus dose starting:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>40 to 50 minutes after an initial dose of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection 0.15 mg/kg;</li>
<li>50 to 60 minutes after an initial dose of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection 0.2 mg/kg.</li>
</ul><p>For long surgical procedures using inhalational anesthetics administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen at the 1.25 MAC level for at least 30 minutes, consider administering less frequent maintenance bolus doses or lower maintenance bolus doses of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. No adjustment to the initial Cisatracurium Besylate Injection maintenance bolus dose should be necessary when Cisatracurium Besylate Injection is administered shortly after initiation of volatile agents or when used in patients receiving propofol anesthesia.</p><h3>Dosage in Burn Patients</h3><p class="First">Burn patients have been shown to develop resistance to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents; therefore, consider increasing the Cisatracurium Besylate Injection dosages for intubation and maintenance <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.8)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage for Continuous Infusion</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Continuous Infusion for Surgical Procedures in Adults and Pediatric Patients<br/></span><br/>
During extended surgical procedures, Cisatracurium Besylate Injection may be administered by continuous infusion to adults and pediatric patients aged 2 or more years if patients have spontaneous recovery after the initial Cisatracurium Besylate Injection bolus dose. Following recovery from neuromuscular blockade, it may be necessary to re-administer a bolus dose to quickly re-establish neuromuscular blockade prior to starting the continuous infusion.<br/>
<br/>
If patients have had recovery of neuromuscular function, the recommended initial cisatracurium infusion rate is 3 mcg/kg/minute <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>. Subsequently reduce the rate to 1 to 2 mcg/kg/minute to maintain continuous neuromuscular blockade. Use peripheral nerve stimulation to assess the level of neuromuscular blockade and to appropriately titrate the cisatracurium infusion rate. If no response is elicited to peripheral nerve stimulation, discontinue the infusion until a response returns.<br/>
<br/>
Consider reducing the infusion rate by up to 30% to 40% when Cisatracurium Besylate Injection is administered during stable isoflurane anesthesia for at least 30 minutes (administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen at the 1.25 MAC level) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. Greater reductions in the cisatracurium infusion rate may be required with longer durations of administration of isoflurane or with the administration of other inhalational anesthetics.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery<br/></span><br/>
Consider reducing the infusion rate in patients undergoing CABG with induced hypothermia to half the rate required during normothermia <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. Spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular block following discontinuation of infusion of cisatracurium is expected to proceed at a rate comparable to that following administration of a single bolus dose.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Continuous Infusion for Mechanical Ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit in Adults<br/></span><br/>
During extended need for mechanical ventilation and skeletal muscle relaxation in the intensive care unit (ICU), Cisatracurium Besylate Injection may be administered by continuous infusion to adults if a patient has spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function after the initial Cisatracurium Besylate Injection bolus dose. Following recovery from neuromuscular blockade, it may be necessary to re-administer a bolus dose to quickly re-establish neuromuscular blockade prior to starting the continuous infusion.<br/>
<br/>
The recommended cisatracurium infusion rate in adult patients in the ICU is 3 mcg/kg/minute (range: 0.5 to 10.2 mcg/kg/minute) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>. Use peripheral nerve stimulation to assess the level of neuromuscular blockade and to appropriately titrate the cisatracurium infusion rate.</p><h3>Rate Tables for Continuous Infusion</h3><p class="First">The intravenous infusion rate depends upon the Cisatracurium Besylate Injection concentration, the desired dose, the patient's weight, and the contribution of the infusion solution to the fluid requirements of the patient. Tables 1 and 2 provide guidelines for the cisatracurium infusion rate, in mL/hour (equivalent to microdrops/minute when 60 microdrops = 1 mL), in concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL or 0.4 mg/mL, respectively.</p><h3>Preparation of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection</h3><p class="First">Visually inspect Cisatracurium Besylate Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. If a Cisatracurium Besylate Injection solution is cloudy or contains visible particulates, do not use Cisatracurium Besylate Injection. Cisatracurium Besylate Injection is a colorless to slightly yellow or greenish-yellow solution.</p><p>Cisatracurium Besylate Injection may be diluted to 0.1 mg/mL in the following solutions:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>5% Dextrose Injection, USP</li>
<li>0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or</li>
<li>5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP</li>
</ul><p>Store these diluted Cisatracurium Besylate Injection solutions either in a refrigerator or at room temperature for 24 hours without significant loss of potency.</p><p>Cisatracurium Besylate Injection also may be diluted to 0.1 mg/mL or 0.2 mg/mL in the following solution:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Lactated Ringer’s and 5% Dextrose Injection</li>
</ul><p>Store this diluted Cisatracurium Besylate Injection solution under refrigeration for no more than 24 hours.</p><p>Do not dilute Cisatracurium Besylate Injection in Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP due to chemical instability.</p><h3>Drug Compatibility</h3><p class="First">Cisatracurium Besylate Injection is compatible and may be administered with the following solutions through Y-site administration:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>5% Dextrose Injection, USP</li>
<li>0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP</li>
<li>5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP</li>
<li>Sufentanil Citrate Injection, diluted as directed</li>
<li>Alfentanil Hydrochloride Injection, diluted as directed</li>
<li>Fentanyl Citrate Injection, diluted as directed</li>
<li>Midazolam Hydrochloride Injection, diluted as directed</li>
<li>Droperidol Injection, diluted as directed</li>
</ul><p>Cisatracurium Besylate Injection is acidic (pH = 3.25 to 3.65) and may not be compatible with alkaline solution having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Therefore, do not administer Cisatracurium Besylate Injection and alkaline solutions simultaneously in the same intravenous line.<br/></p><p>Cisatracurium Besylate Injection is not compatible with propofol injection or ketorolac injection for Y-site administration. Compatibility studies with other parenteral products have not been conducted.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Cisatracurium Besylate Injection is available as a clear solution in the following strengths:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>10 mg of cisatracurium per 5 mL (2 mg/mL) in single-dose vials (equivalent to 2.68 mg/mL cisatracurium besylate)</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Cisatracurium Besylate Injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to cisatracurium. Severe anaphylactic reactions to cisatracurium have been reported <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Residual Paralysis</h3><p class="First">Cisatracurium has been associated with residual paralysis. Patients with neuromuscular diseases (e.g., myasthenia gravis and myasthenic syndrome) and carcinomatosis may be at higher risk of residual paralysis; thus, a lower maximum initial bolus is recommended in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.10)]</span>. To prevent complications resulting from cisatracurium-associated residual paralysis, extubation is recommended only after the patient has recovered sufficiently from neuromuscular blockade. Consider use of a reversal agent especially in cases where residual paralysis is more likely to occur <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><h3>Risk of Seizure</h3><p class="First">Laudanosine, an active metabolite of cisatracurium, has been shown to cause seizures in animals. Cisatracurium-treated patients with renal or hepatic impairment may have higher metabolite concentrations (including laudanosine) than patients with normal renal and hepatic function <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Therefore, patients with renal or hepatic impairment receiving extended administration of cisatracurium may be at higher risk of seizures.<br/>
<br/>
The level of neuromuscular blockade during long-term cisatracurium administration should be monitored with a nerve stimulator to titrate cisatracurium administration to the patients’ needs and limit exposure to toxic metabolites.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis</h3><p class="First">Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including fatal and life-threatening anaphylactic reactions, have been reported <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. There have been reports of wheezing, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, rash and itching following cisatracurium administration in pediatric patients. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, appropriate precautions such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those patients who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents since cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported.</p><h3>Risk of Death Due to Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">Administration of cisatracurium results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death, a progression that may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated.</p><h3>Risks Due to Inadequate Anesthesia</h3><p class="First">Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use cisatracurium in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate.</p><h3>Potentiation of Neuromuscular Blockade</h3><p class="First">Certain drugs may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of cisatracurium including inhalational anesthetics, antibiotics, magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide and quinidine <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>. Additionally, acid-base and/or serum electrolyte abnormalities may potentiate the action of neuromuscular blocking agents. Use peripheral nerve stimulation and monitor the clinical signs of neuromuscular blockade to determine the adequacy of the level of neuromuscular blockage and the need to adjust the cisatracurium dosage.</p><h3>Resistance to Neuromuscular Blockade with Certain Drugs</h3><p class="First">Shorter durations of neuromuscular block may occur and cisatracurium infusion rate requirements may be higher in patients chronically administered phenytoin or carbamazepine <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Use peripheral nerve stimulation and monitor the clinical signs of neuromuscular blockade to determine the adequacy of neuromuscular blockage and the need to adjust the cisatracurium dosage.</p><h3>Malignant Hyperthermia (MH)</h3><p class="First">Cisatracurium has not been studied in MH-susceptible patients. Because MH can develop in the absence of established triggering agents, the clinician should be prepared to recognize and treat MH in any patient undergoing general anesthesia.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials of Cisatracurium in Surgical Patients<br/>
<br/></span> The data presented below are based on studies involving 945 surgical patients who received cisatracurium in conjunction with other drugs in US and European clinical studies in a variety of procedures <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Table 3 displays adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of less than 1%.            </p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials of Cisatracurium in Intensive Care Unit Patients<br/></span><br/>
The adverse reactions presented below were from studies involving 68 adult ICU patients who received cisatracurium in conjunction with other drugs in US and European clinical studies <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>. One patient experienced bronchospasm. In one of the two ICU studies, a randomized and double-blind study of ICU patients using TOF neuromuscular monitoring, there were two reports of prolonged recovery (range: 167 and 270 minutes) among 28 patients administered cisatracurium and 13 reports of prolonged recovery (range: 90 minutes to 33 hours) among 30 patients administered vecuronium.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following events have been identified during post-approval use of cisatracurium in conjunction with one or more anesthetic agents in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to cisatracurium: anaphylaxis, histamine release, prolonged neuromuscular block, muscle weakness, myopathy.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Clinically Significant Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Table 4 displays clinically significant drug interactions with cisatracurium.</p><h3>Drugs Without Clinically Significant Drug Interactions With Cisatracurium Besylate</h3><p class="First">In clinical studies, propofol had no effect on the duration of action or dosing requirements for cisatracurium. Cisatracurium is not compatible with propofol for Y-site administration.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
<br/>
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of cisatracurium in pregnant women. Animal studies conducted in rats administered cisatracurium besylate during organogenesis found no evidence of fetal harm at 0.8 times (ventilated rats) the exposure from a human starting IV bolus dose of 0.2 mg/kg. The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage in the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Clinical Considerations</span><br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Labor or Delivery</span><br/>
<br/>
The action of neuromuscular blocking agents may be enhanced by magnesium salts administered for the management of preeclampsia or eclampsia of pregnancy.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Data</span><br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Animal Data</span><br/>
<br/>
Two embryofetal developmental reproductive toxicity studies were conducted in rats. In a non- ventilated rat study, pregnant animals were treated with cisatracurium besylate subcutaneously twice per day from Gestational Day 6 to 15 using subparalyzing doses (2 and 4 mg/kg daily; equivalent to 6- and 12-times, respectively, the AUC exposure in humans following a bolus dose of 0.2 mg/kg IV). In the ventilated rat study, pregnant animals were treated with cisatracurium besylate intravenously once a day between Gestational Day 6 to 15 using paralyzing doses (0.5 and 1 mg/kg; equivalent to 0.4- and 0.8-times, respectively, the exposure in humans following a bolus dose of 0.2 mg/kg IV based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> comparison). Neither of these studies revealed maternal or fetal toxicity or teratogenic effects.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether cisatracurium besylate is present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for cisatracurium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from cisatracurium or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of cisatracurium as an adjunct to general anesthesia to facilitate tracheal intubation, and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery in pediatric patients 1 month through 12 years of age were established from three studies in pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosing and Administration (2.2, 2.5) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>. The three open-label studies are summarized below.<br/>
<br/>
The safety and effectiveness of cisatracurium have not been established in pediatric patients less than 1 month of age.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Tracheal Intubation</span><br/>
<br/>
A study of 0.15 mg/kg cisatracurium evaluated 230 pediatric patients (ages 1 month to 12 years). Excellent or good intubating conditions were produced 120 seconds following 0.15 mg/kg of cisatracurium in 88 of 90 of patients induced with halothane and in 85 of 90 of patients induced with thiopentone and fentanyl. The study also evaluated 50 pediatric patients during opioid anesthesia, with maximum neuromuscular blockade achieved in an average of about 3 minutes and a clinically effective block for 36 minutes in patients ages 2 to 12 years, and maximum neuromuscular block in about 2 minutes and a clinically effective block for about 43 minutes in infants 1 to 23 months <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In a study of 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium administered in 16 pediatric patients (ages 2 to 12 years) during opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia, maximum neuromuscular blockade was achieved in an average of 2.8 minutes with a clinically effective block for 28 minutes <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Skeletal Muscle Relaxation During Surgery</span><br/>
<br/>
In a study of cisatracurium administered during halothane/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia, 18 pediatric patients (ages 2 to 12 years) were scheduled for surgical procedures that required neuromuscular block for 60 minutes or longer. The average duration of continuous infusion was 62.8 minutes (range: 17 to 145 minutes). The overall mean infusion rate for 9 patients whose infusion was 45 minutes or longer was 1.7 mcg/kg/minute (range: 1.19 to 2.14 mcg/kg/minute).</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of subjects (135) in clinical studies of cisatracurium, 57, 63, and 15 subjects were 65 to 70 years old, 70 to 80 years old, and greater than 80 years old, respectively. The geriatric population included a subset of patients with significant cardiovascular disease <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Because the time to maximum neuromuscular blockade is approximately 1 minute slower in geriatric patients compared to younger patients, consider extending the interval between administering cisatracurium and attempting intubation by at least 1 minute to achieve adequate intubation conditions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The time to maximum neuromuscular blockade is approximately 1 minute slower in geriatric patients, a difference that should be taken into account when selecting a neuromuscular blocking agent (e.g., the need to rapidly secure the airway) and when initiating laryngoscopy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Minor differences in the pharmacokinetics of cisatracurium between elderly and young adult patients were not associated with clinically significant differences in the recovery profile of cisatracurium following a single 0.1 mg/kg dose.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the differences noted above, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to cisatracurium cannot be ruled out.</p><h3>Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The time to 90% neuromuscular blockade was 1 minute slower in patients with end-stage renal disease than in patients with normal renal function. Therefore, consider extending the interval between administering cisatracurium and attempting intubation by at least 1 minute to achieve adequate intubation conditions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
There was no clinically significant alteration in the recovery profile of cisatracurium in patients with end-stage renal disease following a 0.1 mg/kg dose of cisatracurium. The recovery profile of cisatracurium is unchanged in patients with renal impairment, which is consistent with predominantly organ-independent elimination <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetic study analysis in patients with end-stage liver disease undergoing liver transplantation and healthy subjects undergoing elective surgery indicated slightly larger volumes of distribution in liver transplant patients with slightly higher plasma clearances of cisatracurium. The times to maximum neuromuscular blockade were approximately one minute faster in liver transplant patients than in healthy adult patients receiving 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium. These minor differences in pharmacokinetics were not associated with clinically significant differences in the recovery profile of cisatracurium <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Burn Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients with burns have been shown to develop resistance to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. The extent of altered response depends upon the size of the burn and the time elapsed since the burn injury. Cisatracurium has not been studied in patients with burns. However, based on its structural similarity to another neuromuscular blocking agent, consider the possibility of increased dosage requirements and shortened duration of action if cisatracurium is administered to burn patients.</p><h3>Patients with Hemiparesis or Paraparesis</h3><p class="First">Patients with hemiparesis or paraparesis may demonstrate resistance to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants in the affected limbs. To avoid inaccurate dosing, perform neuromuscular monitoring on a non-paretic limb.</p><h3>Patients with Neuromuscular Disease</h3><p class="First">Profound and prolonged neuromuscular blockade may occur in patients with neuromuscular diseases (e.g., myasthenia gravis and myasthenic syndrome) and carcinomatosis. Therefore, a lower maximum initial bolus is recommended in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdosage with neuromuscular blocking agents may result in neuromuscular blockade beyond the time needed for surgery and anesthesia. The primary treatment is maintenance of a patent airway and controlled ventilation until recovery of normal neuromuscular function is assured.<br/>
<br/>
Once recovery from neuromuscular block begins, further recovery may be facilitated by administration of a cholinesterase inhibitor (e.g., neostigmine, edrophonium) in conjunction with an appropriate cholinergic inhibitor. Cholinesterase inhibitors should not be administered when complete neuromuscular blockade is evident or suspected because the reversal of paralysis may not be sufficient to maintain a patent airway and support an appropriate level of spontaneous ventilation. <br/>
<br/></p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Bold">Neostigmine</span>: Administration of 0.04 to 0.07 mg/kg of neostigmine at approximately 10% recovery from neuromuscular blockade (range: 0 to 15%) produced 95% recovery of the muscle twitch response and a T<span class="Sub">4</span>:T<span class="Sub">1</span> ratio ≥ 70% in an average of 9 to 10 minutes.

Under such circumstances the management is the same as that of prolonged neuromuscular block.</p><h2>Cisatracurium Besylate Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Cisatracurium Besylate Injection, USP is a nondepolarizing skeletal neuromuscular blocker for intravenous administration. Compared to other neuromuscular blockers, it is intermediate in its onset and duration of action. Cisatracurium besylate is one of 10 isomers of atracurium besylate and constitutes approximately 15% of that mixture. Cisatracurium besylate is [1<span class="Italics">R</span>-[1α,2α(1'<span class="Italics">R</span>*,2'<span class="Italics">R</span>*)]]-2,2'-[1,5-pentanediylbis[oxy(3-oxo-3,1-propanediyl)]]bis[1-[(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)methyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethoxy-2-methylisoquinolinium] dibenzenesulfonate. The molecular formula of the cisatracurium parent bis-cation is C<span class="Sub">53</span>H<span class="Sub">72</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">12</span> and the molecular weight is 929.2.

The structural formula of cisatracurium besylate is:</p><p>The log of the partition coefficient of cisatracurium besylate is -2.12 in a 1-octanol/distilled water system at 25°C.<br/>
<br/>
Cisatracurium Besylate Injection, USP is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, clear colorless to slightly yellow or greenish-yellow solution provided in 5 mL vial. The pH is adjusted to 3.25 to 3.65 with benzenesulfonic acid.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>The 5 mL single-dose vials contain 2 mg/mL cisatracurium, equivalent to 2.68 mg/mL cisatracurium besylate, USP.</li>
</ul><h2>Cisatracurium Besylate Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Cisatracurium binds competitively to cholinergic receptors on the motor end-plate to antagonize the action of acetylcholine, resulting in blockade of neuromuscular transmission. This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The average ED<span class="Sub">95</span> (dose required to produce 95% suppression of the adductor pollicis muscle twitch response to ulnar nerve stimulation) of cisatracurium is 0.05 mg/kg (range: 0.048 to 0.053) in adults receiving opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia.<br/>
<br/>
The pharmacodynamics of various cisatracurium doses administered over 5 to 10 seconds during opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia are summarized in Table 5. When the cisatracurium dose is doubled, the clinically effective duration of blockade increases by approximately 25 minutes. Once recovery begins, the rate of recovery is independent of dose.<br/>
<br/>
Isoflurane or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC (Minimum Alveolar Concentration) prolonged the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance cisatracurium doses, and decreased the average infusion rate requirement of cisatracurium. The magnitude of these effects depended on the duration of administration of the volatile agents:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Fifteen to 30 minutes of exposure to 1.25 MAC isoflurane or enflurane had minimal effects on the duration of action of initial doses of cisatracurium.</li>
<li>In surgical procedures during enflurane or isoflurane anesthesia greater than 30 minutes, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of cisatracurium were required. The average infusion rate requirement was decreased by as much as 30% to 40% <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</li>
</ul><p>The onset, duration of action, and recovery profiles of cisatracurium during propofol/oxygen or propofol/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia were similar to those during opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia (see Table 5).<br/>
<br/>
Repeated administration of maintenance cisatracurium doses or a continuous cisatracurium infusion for up to 3 hours was not associated with development of tachyphylaxis or cumulative neuromuscular blocking effects. The time needed to recover from successive maintenance doses did not change with the number of doses administered when partial recovery occurred between doses. The rate of spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function after cisatracurium infusion was independent of the duration of infusion and comparable to the rate of recovery following initial doses (see Table 5).<br/>
<br/>
Pediatric patients including infants generally had a shorter time to maximum neuromuscular blockade and a faster recovery from neuromuscular blockade compared to adults treated with the same weight-based doses (see Table 5).</p><p>Hemodynamics Profile<br/>
<br/>
Cisatracurium had no dose-related effects on mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) or heart rate (HR) following doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.4 mg/kg, administered over 5 to 10 seconds, in healthy adult patients (see Figure 1) or in patients with serious cardiovascular disease (see Figure 2).<br/>
<br/>
A total of 141 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery were administered cisatracurium in three active-controlled clinical trials and received doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.4 mg/kg. While the hemodynamic profile was comparable in both the cisatracurium and active control groups, data for doses above 0.3 mg/kg in this population are limited.<br/>

<br/>
<br/></span> No clinically significant changes in MAP or HR were observed following administration of doses up to 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium over 5 to 10 seconds in 2- to 12-year-old pediatric patients who received either halothane/nitrous oxide/oxygen or opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. Doses of 0.15 mg/kg cisatracurium administered over 5 seconds were not consistently associated with changes in HR and MAP in pediatric patients aged 1 month to 12 years who received opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen or halothane/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The neuromuscular blocking activity of cisatracurium is due to parent drug. Cisatracurium plasma concentration-time data following IV bolus administration are best described by a two-compartment open model (with elimination from both compartments) with an elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">½</span>β) of 22 minutes, a plasma clearance (CL) of 4.57 mL/min/kg, and a volume of distribution at steady state (V<span class="Sub">SS</span>) of 145 mL/kg.<br/>
<br/>
Results from population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses from 241 healthy surgical patients are summarized in Table 6.</p><p>The magnitude of interpatient variability in CL was low (16%), as expected based on the importance of Hofmann elimination. The magnitudes of interpatient variability in CL and volume of distribution were low in comparison to those for k<span class="Sub">eo</span>and EC<span class="Sub">50</span>. This suggests that any alterations in the time course of cisatracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade were more likely to be due to variability in the PD parameters than in the PK parameters. Parameter estimates from the population PK analyses were supported by noncompartmental PK analyses on data from healthy patients and from specific populations.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional PK analyses have shown that the PK of cisatracurium are proportional to dose between 0.1 (2 × ED<span class="Sub">95</span>) and 0.2 (4 × ED<span class="Sub">95</span>) mg/kg cisatracurium. In addition, population PK analyses revealed no statistically significant effect of initial dose on CL for doses between 0.1 (2 × ED<span class="Sub">95</span>) and 0.4 (8 × ED<span class="Sub">95</span>) mg/kg cisatracurium.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Distribution<br/></span><br/>
The volume of distribution of cisatracurium is limited by its large molecular weight and high polarity. The Vss was equal to 145 mL/kg (Table 6) in healthy 19- to 64-year-old surgical patients receiving opioid anesthesia. The Vss was 21% larger in similar patients receiving inhalation anesthesia.<br/>
<br/>
The binding of cisatracurium to plasma proteins has not been successfully studied due to its rapid degradation at physiologic pH. Inhibition of degradation requires nonphysiological conditions of temperature and pH which are associated with changes in protein binding.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Elimination<br/></span><br/>
Organ-independent Hofmann elimination (a chemical process dependent on pH and temperature) is the predominant pathway for the elimination of cisatracurium. The liver and kidney play a minor role in the elimination of cisatracurium but are primary pathways for the elimination of metabolites. Therefore, the t½β values of metabolites (including laudanosine) are longer in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and metabolite concentrations may be higher after long-term administration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The mean CL values for cisatracurium ranged from 4.5 to 5.7 mL/min/kg in studies of healthy surgical patients. The compartmental PK modeling suggests that approximately 80% of the cisatracurium CL is accounted for by Hofmann elimination and the remaining 20% by renal and hepatic elimination. These findings are consistent with the low magnitude of interpatient variability in CL (16%) estimated as part of the population PK/PD analyses and with the recovery of parent and metabolites in urine.<br/>
<br/>
In studies of healthy surgical patients, mean t<span class="Sub">½</span>β values of cisatracurium ranged from 22 to 29 minutes and were consistent with the t½β of cisatracurium <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> (29 minutes). The mean ± SD t<span class="Sub">½</span>β values of laudanosine were 3.1 ± 0.4 and 3.3 ± 2.1 hours in healthy surgical patients receiving cisatracurium (n = 10).<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Metabolism:<br/></span><br/>
The degradation of cisatracurium was largely independent of liver metabolism. Results from <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> experiments suggest that cisatracurium undergoes Hofmann elimination (a pH and temperature-dependent chemical process) to form laudanosine <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span> and the monoquaternary acrylate metabolite, neither of which has any neuromuscular blocking activity. The monoquaternary acrylate undergoes hydrolysis by non-specific plasma esterases to form the monoquaternary alcohol (MQA) metabolite. The MQA metabolite can also undergo Hofmann elimination but at a much slower rate than cisatracurium. Laudanosine is further metabolized to desmethyl metabolites which are conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in the urine.<br/>
<br/>
The laudanosine metabolite of cisatracurium has been noted to cause transient hypotension and, in higher doses, cerebral excitatory effects when administered to several animal species. The relationship between CNS excitation and laudanosine concentrations in humans has not been established <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
During IV infusions of cisatracurium, peak plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of laudanosine and the MQA metabolite were approximately 6% and 11% of the parent compound, respectively. The Cmax values of laudanosine in healthy surgical patients receiving infusions of cisatracurium were mean ± SD Cmax: 60 ± 52 ng/mL.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Excretion:<br/></span><br/>
Following <span class="Sup">14</span>C-cisatracurium administration to 6 healthy male patients, 95% of the dose was recovered in the urine (mostly as conjugated metabolites) and 4% in the feces; less than 10% of the dose was excreted as unchanged parent drug in the urine. In 12 healthy surgical patients receiving non-radiolabeled cisatracurium who had Foley catheters placed for surgical management, approximately 15% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Special Populations<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Geriatric Patients<br/></span><br/>
The results of conventional PK analysis from a study of 12 healthy elderly patients and 12 healthy young adult patients who received a single IV cisatracurium dose of 0.1 mg/kg are summarized in Table 7. Plasma clearances of cisatracurium were not affected by age; however, the volumes of distribution were slightly larger in elderly patients than in young patients resulting in slightly longer t<span class="Sub">½</span>β values for cisatracurium.<br/>
<br/>
The rate of equilibration between plasma cisatracurium concentrations and neuromuscular blockade was slower in elderly patients than in young patients (mean ± SD k<span class="Sub">eo</span>: 0.071 ± 0.036 and 0.105 ± 0.021 minutes<span class="Sup">-1</span>, respectively); there was no difference in the patient sensitivity to cisatracurium-induced block, as indicated by EC<span class="Sub">50</span>values (mean ± SD EC<span class="Sub">50</span>: 91 ± 22 and 89 ± 23 ng/mL, respectively). These changes were consistent with the 1-minute slower times to maximum block in elderly patients receiving 0.1 mg/kg cisatracurium, when compared to young patients receiving the same dose. The minor differences in PK/PD parameters of cisatracurium between elderly patients and young patients were not associated with clinically significant differences in the recovery profile of cisatracurium.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Hepatic Impairment</span>:<br/>
<br/>
Table 8 summarizes the conventional PK analysis from a study of cisatracurium in 13 patients with end-stage liver disease undergoing liver transplantation and 11 healthy adult patients undergoing elective surgery. The slightly larger volumes of distribution in liver transplant patients were associated with slightly higher plasma clearances of cisatracurium.

In Study 6, a cisatracurium dose of 0.1 mg/kg was evaluated in 16 pediatric patients (ages 2 years to 12 years) during opioid anesthesia. When administered during stable opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia, maximum neuromuscular blockade was achieved in an average of 2.8 minutes (range: 1.8 to 6.7 minutes) with a clinically effective block for 28 minutes (range: 21 to 38 minutes).<br/>
