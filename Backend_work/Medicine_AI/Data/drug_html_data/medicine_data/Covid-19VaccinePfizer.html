It is predominantly a respiratory illness that can affect other organs. People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may include: fever or chills; cough; shortness of breath; fatigue; muscle or body aches; headache; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; congestion or runny nose; nausea or vomiting; diarrhea.</p><p><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Storage and Handling</span></p><p>During storage, minimize exposure to room light, and avoid exposure to direct sunlight and ultraviolet light.</p><p>Do not refreeze thawed vials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Frozen Vials Prior to Use</span></p><p>Cartons of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Multiple Dose Vials arrive in thermal containers with dry ice. Once received, remove the vial cartons immediately from the thermal container and preferably store in an ultra-low temperature freezer between -80°C to -60°C (-112°F to -76°F) until the expiry date printed on the label. Alternatively, vials may be stored at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F) for up to 2 weeks. Vials must be kept frozen and protected from light until ready to use. Vials stored at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F) for up to 2 weeks may be returned one time to the recommended storage condition of -80°C to -60°C (-112°F to -76°F). Total cumulative time the vials are stored at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F) should be tracked and should not exceed 2 weeks.</p><p>If an ultra-low temperature freezer is not available, the thermal container in which the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine arrives may be used as <span class="Bold">temporary</span> storage when consistently re-filled to the top of the container with dry ice. <span class="Bold">Refer to the re-icing guidelines packed in the original thermal container for instructions regarding the use of the thermal container for temporary storage</span>.

Study BNT162-01 (Study 1) was a Phase 1/2, two-part, dose-escalation trial that enrolled 60 participants, 18 through 55 years of age. Study C4591001 (Study 2) is a Phase 1/2/3, multicenter, multinational, randomized, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection (Phase 1) and efficacy (Phase 2/3) study that has enrolled approximately 44,000 participants, 12 years of age or older. Of these, approximately 43,448 participants (21,720 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine; 21,728 placebo) in Phase 2/3 are 16 years of age or older (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively).</p><p>At the time of the analysis of Study 2 for the EUA, 37,586 (18,801 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 18,785 placebo) participants 16 years of age or older have been followed for a median of 2 months after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.</p><p>The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The safety population includes participants enrolled by October 9, 2020, and includes safety data accrued through November 14, 2020. Participants 18 years and older in the reactogenicity subset are monitored for solicited local and systemic reactions and use of antipyretic medication after each vaccination in an electronic diary. Participants are being monitored for unsolicited adverse events, including serious adverse events, throughout the study [from Dose 1 through 1 month (all unsolicited adverse events) or 6 months (serious adverse events) after the last vaccination].</p><p>Demographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity among participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the total participants who received either the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo, 50.6% were male and 49.4% were female, 83.1% were White, 9.1% were Black or African American, 28.0% were Hispanic/Latino, 4.3% were Asian, and 0.5% were American Indian/Alaska Native.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions Solicited in the Study 2</span></p><p>Table 1 and Table 2 present the frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic reactions, respectively, within 7 days following each dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and placebo in the subset of participants 18 to 55 years of age included in the EUA safety population who were monitored for reactogenicity with an electronic diary.</p><p>Table 3 and Table 4 present the frequency and severity of reported solicited local and systemic reactions, respectively, within 7 days of each dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and placebo for participants 56 years of age and older.</p><p>Across both age groups, the mean duration of pain at the injection site after Dose 2 was 2.5 days (range 1 to 36 days), for redness 2.6 days (range 1 to 34 days), and for swelling 2.3 days (range 1 to 34 days) for participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group.</p><p>Solicited reactogenicity data in 16 and 17 year-old participants are limited.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Unsolicited Adverse Events</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Serious Adverse Events</span></p><p>In Study 2, among participants 16 to 55 years of age who had received at least 1 dose of vaccine or placebo (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine = 10,841; placebo = 10,851), serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported by 0.4% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.3% of placebo recipients. In a similar analysis, in participants 56 years of age and older (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine = 7960, placebo = 7934), serious adverse events were reported by 0.8% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.6% of placebo recipients who received at least 1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo, respectively. In these analyses, 91.6% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. Appendicitis was reported as a serious adverse event for 12 participants, and numerically higher in the vaccine group, 8 vaccine participants and 4 placebo participants. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Non-Serious Adverse Events</span></p><p>Overall in Study 2 in which 10,841 participants 16 to 55 years of age received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 10,851 participants received placebo, non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported in 29.3% of participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 13.2% of participants in the placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. Overall in a similar analysis in which 7960 participants 56 years of age and older received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, non-serious adverse events within 30 days were reported in 23.8% of participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 11.7% of participants in the placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. In these analyses, 91.6% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. The higher frequency of reported unsolicited non-serious adverse events among Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients was primarily attributed to local and systemic adverse events reported during the first 7 days following vaccination that are consistent with adverse reactions solicited among participants in the reactogenicity subset and presented in Tables 3 and 4. From Dose 1 through 30 days after Dose 2, reports of lymphadenopathy were imbalanced with notably more cases in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group (64) vs. the placebo group (6), which is plausibly related to vaccination. Throughout the safety follow-up period to date, Bell's palsy (facial paralysis) was reported by four participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group. Onset of facial paralysis was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of Bell's palsy were reported in the placebo group. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.</p><h3>Post Authorization Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post authorization use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved or cleared product. FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that the product may be effective to prevent COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product. All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 EUA declaration justifying emergency use of these products, unless terminated or revoked (after which the products may no longer be used).</p><p><br/>
