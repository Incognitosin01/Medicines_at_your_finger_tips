Replace container closure immediately after using.  Prolonged use of a topical ocular anesthetic is not recommended.  It may product permanent corneal opacification with accompanying visual loss.</p><p><br/></p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">This product should be used cautiously and sparingly in patients with known allergies, cardiac disease, or hyperthyroidism.  The long-term toxicity is unknown; prolonged use may possibly delay wound healing.  Although exceedingly rare with ophthalmic application of local anesthetics, it should be borne in mind that systemic toxicity manifested by central nervous system stimulation followed by depression may occur.  Protection of the eye from irritating chemicals, foreign bodies and rubbing during the period of anesthesia is very important.  Tonometers soaked in sterilizing or detergent solutions should be thoroughly rinsed with sterile distilled water prior to use.  Patients should be advised to avoid touching the eye until the anesthesia has worn off.<br/></p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Occasional temporary stinging, burning, and conjunctival redness have been reported after use of ocular anesthetics, as well as a rare, severe, immediate-type, apparent hyper-allergic corneal reaction, with acute, intense and diffuse epithelial keratitis, a gray, ground glass appearance, sloughing of large areas of necrotic epithelium, corneal filaments and sometimes, iritis with descementitis.  Allergic contact dermatitis with drying and fissuring of the fingertips has been reported.</p><p>To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Altaire Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (631) 722-5988.<br/></p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Usual Dosage:</span> Removal of foreign bodies and sutures, and for tonometry, 1 to 2 drops (in single instillations) in each eye before operating. <br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Deep Ophthalmic Anesthesia:</span> 1 drop in each eye every 5 to 10 minutes for 5-7 doses.</p><p><span class="Italics">NOTE:</span> The use of an eye patch is recommended.</p><p><br/></p><h2>STORAGE:</h2><p class="First">Store in refrigerator at 2째-8째C (36째-46째F).
