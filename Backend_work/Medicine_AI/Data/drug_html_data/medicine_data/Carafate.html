It works mainly in the lining of the stomach by sticking to ulcer sites and protecting them from acids, enzymes, and bile salts.</p><p>Carafate is used to treat an active duodenal ulcer. Sucralfate can heal an active ulcer, but it will not prevent future ulcers from occurring.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>The liquid form of Carafate should never be injected through a needle into the body, or death may occur.</b></p><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package.
