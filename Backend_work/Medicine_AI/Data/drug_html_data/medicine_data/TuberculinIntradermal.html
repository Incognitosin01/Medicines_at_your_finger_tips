If the test is positive, a reaction will be seen at and around the place of injection or puncture. If the test is given using an injection, this reaction is usually a hard, raised area with clear margins. If the test is given using the puncture devices, the reaction is usually a swollen area at the puncture site. The size of the reaction is measured and recorded and the results of the test are studied after 48 to 72 hours.</p><p>Tuberculin is to be given only by or under the supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using tuberculin</h2><p>In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do.
