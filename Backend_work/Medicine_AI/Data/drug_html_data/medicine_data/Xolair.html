Xolair is used when asthma symptoms are not controlled by asthma inhaled steroid medicine. It is not a rescue medicine for treating an asthma attack.</p><p>Xolair is used to treat chronic hives (idiopathic urticaria) in adults and children who are at least 12 years old, after antihistamines have been tried without success.</p><p>Xolair is also used to treat nasal polyps in people 18 years of age and older when medicines called nasal corticosteroids have not worked well.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Some people using Xolair have had a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction either right after the injection or hours later.
