Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate alone should not be used in patients with HIV-1 infection <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><p>Prior to initiation and during use of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><h3>Recommended Tablet Dosage in Adults and Pediatric Patients 2 Years and Older Weighing at Least 17 kg</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg is one 300 mg tablet taken orally once daily without regard to food. The dosage for Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate is the same for both HIV and HBV indications.</p><p>The recommended dosage of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate tablet in adults and pediatric patients 2 years and older weighing at least 17 kg is 8 mg of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) per kg of body weight (up to a maximum of 300 mg) once daily. Dosage for pediatric patients 2 years and older weighing between 17 kg and 35 kg and able to swallow an intact tablet is provided in Table 1. Weight should be monitored periodically and the Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate dose adjusted accordingly.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1 Recommended Dosing for Patients 2 Years and Older and Weighing at Least 17 kg Using Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate</span></p><h3>Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Significant increase in drug exposures occurred when Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate was administered to subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min). Table 3 provides dosage interval adjustment for patients with renal impairment. No dosage adjustment of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate tablets 300 mg is necessary for patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50–80 mL/min) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3 Dosage Interval Adjustment for Adult Patients with Altered Creatinine Clearance</span></p><p>No data are available to make dosage recommendations in patients with creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min who are not on hemodialysis.</p><p>No data are available to make dose recommendations in pediatric patients with renal impairment.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate is available as tablets.</p><p>Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate tablets 300 mg contain 300 mg of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate which is equivalent to 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil. The tablets are white circular film coated, convex tablets engraved "TDF" on one side and plain on other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients with HBV Infection</h3><p class="First">All patients should be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before or when initiating Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].</span></p><p>Discontinuation of anti-HBV therapy, including Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate, may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. Patients infected with HBV who discontinue Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure.</p><h3>New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Tenofovir is principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p>Prior to initiation and during use of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus.</p><p>Dosing interval adjustment of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with creatinine clearance below 50 ml/min <span class="Italics">[See Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>. No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity.</p><p>Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) <span class="Italics">[See Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.</p><p>Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in patients at risk of renal dysfunction.</p><h3>Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV</h3><p class="First">Due to the risk of development of HIV-1 resistance, Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate should only be used in HIV-1 and HBV coinfected patients as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen.</p><p>HIV-1 antibody testing should be offered to all HBV-infected patients before initiating therapy with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate. It is also recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B before initiating treatment with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate.</p><h3>Immune Reconstitution Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, HIV-1 infected patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium avium</span> infection, cytomegalovirus, <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span> pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.</p><p>Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.</p><h3>Bone Loss and Mineralization Defects</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Bone Mineral Density</span></p><p>In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults, Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators <span class="Italics">[See Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate.</p><p>Clinical trials evaluating Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate in pediatric subjects were conducted. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in pediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected subjects 2 years to less than 18 years of age, bone effects were similar to those observed in adult subjects and suggest increased bone turnover. Total body BMD gain was less in the Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate-treated HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects as compared to the control groups. Similar trends were observed in chronic HBV-infected pediatric subjects 12 years to less than 18 years of age. In all pediatric trials, normal skeletal growth (height) was not affected for the duration of the clinical trials <span class="Italics">[See Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>The effects of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate -associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk in adults and pediatric subjects 2 years and older are unknown. The long-term effect of lower spine and total body BMD on skeletal growth in pediatric patients, and in particular, the effects of long-duration exposure in younger children is unknown.</p><p>Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial. Assessment of BMD should be considered for adult and pediatric patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. If bone abnormalities are suspected, appropriate consultation should be obtained.</p><p><span class="Italics">Mineralization Defects</span></p><p>Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate use <span class="Italics">[See Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span> Arthralgia and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing TDF-containing products <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric use information is approved for Gilead Sciences, Inc.'s VIREAD® (Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate) tablets. However, due to Gilead Sciences, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.</span></p><h3>Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis</h3><p class="First">Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including TDF, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).</p><h3>Risk of Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)].</span></p><p>See Table 12 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate; review concomitant medications during therapy with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate; and monitor for adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience in HIV-1 Infected Adults</span></p><p>More than 12,000 subjects have been treated with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate alone or in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for periods of 28 days to 215 weeks in clinical trials and expanded access programs. A total of 1,544 subjects have received Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 300 mg once daily in clinical trials; over 11,000 subjects have received Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate in expanded access programs.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, Grades 2-4) identified from any of the 3 large controlled clinical trials include rash, diarrhea, headache, pain, depression, asthenia, and nausea.</p><p><span class="Italics">Clinical Trials in Treatment-Naïve HIV-1 Infected Adult Subjects</span></p><p>In Trial 903, 600 antiretroviral-naïve subjects received Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (N=299) or stavudine (d4T) (N=301) administered in combination with lamivudine (3TC) and efavirenz (EFV) for 144 weeks. The most common adverse reactions were mild to moderate gastrointestinal events and dizziness.

Changes in BMD at the hip were similar between the two treatment groups (-2.8% ± 3.5 in the Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate group vs. -2.4% ± 4.5 in the stavudine group). In both groups, the majority of the reduction in BMD occurred in the first 24–48 weeks of the trial and this reduction was sustained through Week 144. Twenty-eight percent of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate-treated subjects vs. 21% of the stavudine-treated subjects lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine or 7% of BMD at the hip. Clinically relevant fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 4 subjects in the Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate group and 6 subjects in the stavudine group. In addition, there were significant increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism (serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, serum C telopeptide, and urinary N telopeptide) and higher serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels in the Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate group relative to the stavudine group; however, except for bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, these changes resulted in values that remained within the normal range <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>. </p><p>In Trial 934, 511 antiretroviral-naïve subjects received efavirenz (EFV) administered in combination with either emtricitabine (FTC) + Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (N=257) or zidovudine (AZT)/lamivudine (3TC) (N=254) for 144 weeks. The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, all grades) included diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash.

Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate requires initial diester hydrolysis for conversion to tenofovir and subsequent phosphorylations by cellular enzymes to form tenofovir diphosphate, an obligate chain terminator. Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and HBV reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases α, β, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Activity against HIV</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Antiviral Activity</span></p><p>The antiviral activity of tenofovir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, primary monocyte/macrophage cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes. The EC50 (50% effective concentration) values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.04 μM to 8.5 μM. In drug combination studies, tenofovir was not antagonistic with HIV-1 NRTIs (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, zidovudine), NNRTIs ( efavirenz, nevirapine), and protease inhibitors (amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir). Tenofovir displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O (EC50 values ranged from 0.5 μM to 2.2 μM) and strain-specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 1.6 μM to 5.5 μM).</p><p><span class="Italics">Resistance</span></p><p>HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir have been selected in cell culture. These viruses expressed a K65R substitution in reverse transcriptase and showed a 2 to 4-fold reduction in susceptibility to tenofovir. In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase has been selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to tenofovir.</p><p>In Trial 903 of treatment-naïve subjects (Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate + lamivudine + efavirenz versus stavudine + lamivudine + efavirenz) <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>, genotypic analyses of isolates from subjects with virologic failure through Week 144 showed development of efavirenz and lamivudine resistance-associated substitutions to occur most frequently and with no difference between the treatment arms. The K65R substitution occurred in 8/47 (17%) of analyzed patient isolates in the Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate arm and in 2/49 (4%) of analyzed patient isolates in the stavudine arm. Of the 8 subjects whose virus developed K65R in the Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate arm through 144 weeks, 7 occurred in the first 48 weeks of treatment and one at Week 96. One patient in the Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate arm developed the K70E substitution in the virus. Other substitutions resulting in resistance to Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate were not identified in this trial.</p><p>In Trial 934 of treatment-naïve subjects (Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate + EMTRIVA + efavirenz versus zidovudine (AZT)/lamivudine (3TC) + efavirenz) <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>, genotypic analysis performed on HIV-1 isolates from all confirmed virologic failure subjects with greater than 400 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA at Week 144 or early discontinuation showed development of efavirenz resistance-associated substitutions occurred most frequently and was similar between the two treatment arms The M184V substitution, associated with resistance to EMTRIVA and lamivudine, was observed in 2/19 of analyzed subject isolates in the Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate + EMTRIVA group and in 10/29 analyzed subject isolates in the zidovudine/lamivudine group. Through 144 weeks of Trial 934, no subjects have developed a detectable K65R substitution in their HIV-1 as analyzed through standard genotypic analysis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cross-Resistance</span></p><p>Cross-resistance among certain reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been recognized. The K65R and K70E substitutions selected by tenofovir are also selected in some HIV-1 infected subjects treated with abacavir or didanosine. HIV-1 isolates with this substitution also show reduced susceptibility to emtricitabine and lamivudine. Therefore, cross-resistance among these drugs may occur in patients whose virus harbors the K65R or K70E substitution. HIV-1 isolates from subjects (N=20) whose HIV-1 expressed a mean of three zidovudine-associated reverse transcriptase substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N), showed a 3.1-fold decrease in the susceptibility to tenofovir.</p><p>In Trials 902 and 907 conducted in treatment-experienced subjects (Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate + Standard Background Therapy (SBT) compared to Placebo + SBT) <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.2))]</span>, 14/304 (5%) of the Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate-treated subjects with virologic failure through Week 96 had &gt; 1.4-fold (median 2.7-fold) reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. Genotypic analysis of the baseline and failure isolates showed the development of the K65R substitution in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase gene.</p><p>The virologic response to Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate therapy has been evaluated with respect to baseline viral genotype (N=222) in treatment-experienced subjects participating in Trials  902 and 907.In these clinical trials, 94% of the participants evaluated had baseline HIV-1 isolates expressing at least one NRTI substitution. Virologic responses for subjects in the genotype substudy were similar to the overall trial results.</p><p>Several exploratory analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of specific substitutions and substitutional patterns on virologic outcome. Because of the large number of potential comparisons, statistical testing was not conducted. Varying degrees of cross-resistance of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate to pre-existing zidovudine resistance-associated substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N) were observed and appeared to depend on the type and number of specific substitutions. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate-treated subjects whose HIV-1 expressed 3 or more zidovudine resistance-associated substitutions that included either the M41L or L210W reverse transcriptase substitution showed reduced responses to Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate therapy; however, these responses were still improved compared with placebo. The presence of the D67N, K70R, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N substitution did not appear to affect responses to Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate therapy. Subjects whose virus expressed an L74V substitution without zidovudine resistance associated substitutions (N=8) had reduced response to Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate. Limited data are available for subjects whose virus expressed a Y115F substitution (N=3), Q151M substitution (N=2), or T69 insertion (N=4), all of whom had a reduced response.</p><p>In the protocol defined analyses, virologic response to Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate was not reduced in subjects with HIV-1 that expressed the abacavir/emtricitabine/lamivudine resistance-associated M184V substitution.

During the 48-week randomized phase of the trial, 1 subject in the Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate group discontinued the trial prematurely because of virologic failure/lack of efficacy and 3 subjects (2 subjects in the Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate group and 1 subject in the d4T or zidovudine group) discontinued for other reasons.</p><p>In Trial 321, 87 treatment-experienced subjects 12 years to less than 18 years of age were treated with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (N=45) or placebo (N=42) in combination with an optimized background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks. The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 374 cells/mm3 and the mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.6 log10 copies/mL. At baseline, 90% of subjects harbored NRTI resistance- associated substitutions in their HIV-1 isolates. Overall, the trial failed to show a difference in virologic response between the Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate and placebo groups. Subgroup analyses suggest the lack of difference in virologic response may be attributable to imbalances between treatment arms in baseline viral susceptibility to Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate and OBR.</p><p>Although changes in HIV-1 RNA in these highly treatment-experienced subjects were less than anticipated, the comparability of the pharmacokinetic and safety data to that observed in adults supports the use of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate in pediatric patients 12 years and older who weigh at least 35 kg and whose HIV-1 isolate is expected to be sensitive to Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Clinical Trial Results in Adults with Chronic Hepatitis B</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HBeAg-Negative Chronic HBV Subjects: Trial 0102</span></p><p>Trial 0102 was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 300 mg compared to HEPSERA 10 mg in 375 HBeAg- (anti-HBe+) subjects with compensated liver function, the majority of whom were nucleoside-naïve.
