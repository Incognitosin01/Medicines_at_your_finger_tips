<li>with moderate or severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7)]</span> .</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir, a component of Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets. These hypersensitivity reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and typically occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir (median time to onset was 9 days); although abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during treatment <span class="Italics">[see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]</span>. Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; although, patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele have developed hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 206 (8%) of 2,670 patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where HLA-B*5701 screening was not performed. The incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions in clinical trials was 1% when subjects carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele were excluded. In any patient treated with abacavir, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision making.</p><p>Due to the potential for severe, serious, and possibly fatal hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>All patients should be screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets or reinitiation of therapy with Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets, unless patients have a previously documented HLA-B*5701 allele assessment.</li>
<li>Abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine tablets are contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA-B*5701-positive patients.</li>
<li>Before starting Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets, review medical history for prior exposure to any abacavir-containing product. NEVER restart Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets or any other abacavir-containing product following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status.</li>
<li>To reduce the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status, discontinue abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g., acute onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or influenza; gastroenteritis; or reactions to other medications).</li>
<li>If a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out, do not restart Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets or any other abacavir-containing products because more severe symptoms, which may include life-threatening hypotension and death, can occur within hours.</li>
<li>If a hypersensitivity reaction is ruled out, patients may restart abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Rarely, patients who have stopped abacavir for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity have also experienced life-threatening reactions within hours of reinitiating abacavir therapy. Therefore, reintroduction of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets or any other abacavir-containing product is recommended only if medical care can be readily accessed.</li>
<li>A Medication Guide and Warning Card that provide information about recognition of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions should be dispensed with each new prescription and refill.</li>
</ul><h3>Hematologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression</h3><p class="First">Zidovudine, a component of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells per mm<span class="Sup">3</span> or hemoglobin less than 9.5 grams per dL <span class="Italics">[see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed.</p><h3>Myopathy</h3><p class="First">Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets.</p><h3>Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis</h3><p class="First">Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine (components of Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets). A majority of these cases have been in women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. See full prescribing information for ZIAGEN<span class="Sup">®</span> (abacavir), EPIVIR<span class="Sup">®</span> (lamivudine), and RETROVIR<span class="Sup">®</span> (zidovudine). Treatment with Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).</p><h3>Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis</span></span></p><p>Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR<span class="Sup">®</span> (lamivudine). Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV</span></span></p><p>Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has been reported in HIV–1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR<span class="Sup">®</span> (lamivudine).</p><h3>Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens</h3><p class="First"> Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. See full prescribing information for RETROVIR<span class="Sup">®</span> (zidovudine). Discontinuation of Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin).</p><p>Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is not advised.</p><h3>Immune Reconstitution Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium avium</span> infection, cytomegalovirus, <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span> pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.</p><p>Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-BarrÉ syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.</p><h3>Lipoatrophy</h3><p class="First">Treatment with zidovudine, a component of Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets, has been associated with loss of subcutaneous fat. The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy are related to cumulative exposure. This fat loss, which is most evident in the face, limbs, and buttocks, may be only partially reversible and improvement may take months to years after switching to a non-zidovudine-containing regimen. Patients should be regularly assessed for signs of lipoatrophy during therapy with zidovudine-containing products, and if feasible, therapy should be switched to an alternative regimen if there is suspicion of lipoatrophy.</p><h3>Myocardial Infarction</h3><p class="First">Several prospective, observational, epidemiological studies have reported an association with the use of abacavir and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled clinical trials have observed no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain a potential increase in risk. In totality, the available data from the observational studies and from controlled clinical trials show inconsistency; therefore, evidence for a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of MI is inconclusive.</p><p>As a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).</p><h3>Therapy-Experienced Patients</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials, subjects with prolonged prior nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) exposure or who had HIV-1 isolates that contained multiple mutations conferring resistance to NRTIs had limited response to abacavir. The potential for cross-resistance between abacavir and other NRTIs should be considered when choosing new therapeutic regimens in therapy- experienced patients <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Serious and Fatal Abacavir-Associated Hypersensitivity Reactions</span></span></p><p>In clinical trials, serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir, a component of Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets <span class="Italics">[see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].</span> These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome.</p><p>Other signs and symptoms have included lethargy, headache, myalgia, edema, arthralgia, and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, myolysis, and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and maculopapular or urticarial rash (although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash). There were reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia, and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which were localized).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Additional Adverse Reactions with Use of Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets</span></span></p><p>Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with a frequency greater than or equal to 5% during therapy with abacavir 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and zidovudine 300 mg twice daily compared with indinavir 800 mg 3 times daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and zidovudine 300 mg twice daily from CNA3005 are listed in Table 1.</p><p>Five subjects receiving abacavir in CNA3005 experienced worsening of pre-existing depression compared to none in the indinavir arm.

Fetal malformations (increased incidences of fetal anasarca and skeletal malformations) or developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weight and crown-rump length) were observed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures approximately 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended daily dose. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 100 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) 3.5 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose.
