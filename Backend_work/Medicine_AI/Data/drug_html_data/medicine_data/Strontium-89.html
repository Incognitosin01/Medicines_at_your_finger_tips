Measure dose by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IV: Administer intravenously slowly over 1 to 2 minutes. Radiopharmaceutical; use appropriate precautions for handling and disposal.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store vial (and contents) at 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F); store in transportation shield container.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>There are no known significant interactions.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Frequency not defined.</p><p>Cardiovascular: Flushing (after rapid injection)</p><p>Hematologic &amp; oncologic: Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia (nadir: 12 to 16 weeks; recovery: 6 months)</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Ostealgia (transient increase; duration: 36 to 72 hours)</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Chills, fever, hot flash, septicemia</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Bone marrow suppression: Bone marrow toxicity (thrombocytopenia and leukopenia) is likely to occur. Use is not recommended in patients with seriously compromised bone marrow function from prior therapies or from disease infiltration (unless potential benefit outweighs risks). Monitor CBC at least every other week. The platelet nadir typically occurs between 12 and 16 weeks following administration; platelets and WBC recovery occur slowly, generally reaching baseline levels 6 months after treatment in the absence of other therapy interventions or disease progression. Use with caution in patients with platelets &lt;60,000/mm<sup>3</sup> or WBCs &lt;2,400/mm<sup>3</sup>. Carefully evaluate bone marrow status and toxicity of initial dose if considering repeat administration.</p><p>• Bone pain: A small number of patients have experienced a transient increase in bone pain at 36 to 72 hours after administration; this is generally mild and self-limiting.</p><p>• Flushing: A flushing sensation has been reported following rapid (&lt;30 seconds) injection.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Incontinence: Incontinent patients may require urinary catheterization (to minimize radioactive contamination of clothing, bedding, and/or environment).</p><p>• Renal impairment: Primarily eliminated renally; possible risk versus benefit should be evaluated in patients with renal impairment.</p><p><b><i>Special handling:</i></b></p><p>• Radiopharmaceutical: Use appropriate precautions for handling, disposal, and minimizing exposure to patients and healthcare personnel. Use only under supervision of individuals with experience/training in the handling of radioactive materials approved by the applicable regulatory authority. Patients should take the following precautions to minimize exposure (Silberstein 2003): Avoid soiling underclothing or areas around toilet bowls for 2 weeks after injection. Wash any underclothing separately if significantly stained with urine. Where a normal toilet is available, sit to urinate in preference to a urinal. Flush toilet twice after use. Wash hands thoroughly after urination.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Strontium-89 is not indicated for use in patients with cancer not involving bone. Due to delayed onset of pain relief (7 to 20 days following administration), also not indicated for use in patients with a short life expectancy.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential (at least every other week)</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
