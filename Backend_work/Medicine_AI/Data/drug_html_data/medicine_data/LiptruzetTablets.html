</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Liptruzet Tablets</h2><p class="First">Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate.</p><h3>Primary Hyperlipidemia</h3><p class="First">LIPTRUZET™ is indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides (TG), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia.</p><h3>Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)</h3><p class="First">LIPTRUZET is indicated for the reduction of elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable.</p><h3>Limitations of Use</h3><p class="First">No incremental benefit of LIPTRUZET on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for atorvastatin has been established. LIPTRUZET has not been studied in Fredrickson type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias.</p><h2>Liptruzet Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosing</h3><p class="First">The dosage range of LIPTRUZET is 10/10 mg/day to 10/80 mg/day. The recommended starting dose of LIPTRUZET is 10/10 mg/day or 10/20 mg/day. LIPTRUZET can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The recommended starting dose for patients who require a larger reduction in LDL-C (greater than 55%) is 10/40 mg/day. After initiation and/or upon titration of LIPTRUZET, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 or more weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.</p><p>Patients should swallow Liptruzet Tablets whole. Tablets should not be crushed, dissolved, or chewed.</p><h3>Patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia</h3><p class="First">The dosage of LIPTRUZET in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is 10/40 mg/day or 10/80 mg/day. LIPTRUZET should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable.</p><h3>Coadministration with Other Drugs</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Bile Acid Sequestrants</span></p><p>Dosing of LIPTRUZET should occur either ≥2 hours before or ≥4 hours after administration of a bile acid sequestrant <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.11)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors</span></p><p>In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with LIPTRUZET should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing LIPTRUZET and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with LIPTRUZET should be limited to 10/20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of LIPTRUZET is employed. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, therapy with LIPTRUZET should be limited to 10/40 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of LIPTRUZET is employed. <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7).]</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Other Concomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy</span></p><p>The combination of LIPTRUZET and gemfibrozil is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of hepatic transaminase levels.</p><p>Hypersensitivity to any component of LIPTRUZET <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p>Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. LIPTRUZET may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of LIPTRUZET use during pregnancy; however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. LIPTRUZET should be administered to women of childbearing age only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, LIPTRUZET should be discontinued immediately, and the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p>Nursing mothers. It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk; however, a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require LIPTRUZET treatment should not breast-feed their infants <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Atorvastatin</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with atorvastatin and with other drugs in this class.</span> A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects.</p><p>Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values &gt;10 times upper limit of normal (ULN). The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis.</p><p>There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatinine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation; improvement with immunosuppressive agents.</p><p>Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing LIPTRUZET. LIPTRUZET therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.</p><p>The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with LIPTRUZET and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipid-modifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of LIPTRUZET should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs. <span class="Italics">[See Drug Interactions (7).]</span> Periodic CPK determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy.</p><p>Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 <span class="Italics">[</span>see also <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3), Drug Interactions (7)</span>, <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p>Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing LIPTRUZET with colchicine <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.10)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">LIPTRUZET therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures).</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Ezetimibe</span></p><p>In clinical trials, there was no excess of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis associated with ezetimibe compared with the relevant control arm (placebo or statin alone). However, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are known adverse reactions to statins and other lipid-lowering drugs. In clinical trials, the incidence of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) &gt;10 times ULN was 0.2% for ezetimibe vs. 0.1% for placebo, and 0.1% for ezetimibe coadministered with a statin vs. 0.4% for statins alone. Risk for skeletal muscle toxicity increases with higher doses of statin, advanced age (&gt;65), hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and depending on the statin used, concomitant use of other drugs.</p><p>In post-marketing experience with ezetimibe, cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin prior to initiating ezetimibe. However, rhabdomyolysis has been reported with ezetimibe monotherapy and with the addition of ezetimibe to agents known to be associated with increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibric acid derivatives. LIPTRUZET and a fenofibrate, if taking concomitantly, should both be immediately discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The presence of muscle symptoms and a CPK level &gt;10 times the ULN indicates myopathy.</p><h3>Liver Enzymes</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Atorvastatin</span></p><p>Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (&gt;3 times ULN occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg atorvastatin, respectively.</p><p>One patient in clinical trials of atorvastatin developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Ezetimibe</span></p><p>In controlled clinical studies, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥3 times ULN) in hepatic transaminase levels was similar between ezetimibe (0.5%) and placebo (0.3%).</p><p>In controlled clinical combination studies of ezetimibe coadministered with atorvastatin, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥3 times ULN) in hepatic transaminase levels was 0.6% for patients treated with ezetimibe administered with atorvastatin. These elevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic, not associated with cholestasis, and returned to baseline after discontinuation of therapy or with continued treatment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">LIPTRUZET</span></p><p>It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with LIPTRUZET and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with LIPTRUZET, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart LIPTRUZET.</p><p>LIPTRUZET should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of LIPTRUZET <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Endocrine Function</h3><p class="First">Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including atorvastatin.</p><p>Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal and/or gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve and that ezetimibe did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if LIPTRUZET is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine.</p><h3>Use in Patients with Recent Stroke or TIA</h3><p class="First">In a post-hoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where atorvastatin 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the atorvastatin 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3% atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4% placebo; HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.59; p=0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin (38, 1.6%) group as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7%). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group.</p><h3>CNS Toxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Atorvastatin</span></p><p>Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mg/kg/day. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mg/kg/day. The 120 mg/kg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma area-under-the-curve (AUC, 0-24 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mg/day. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mg/kg/day and one at 120 mg/kg/day) in a 2-year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day or in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC<span class="Sub">(0-24)</span> based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mg/day.</p><p>CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:</p><ul class="Disc">

<li>Liver enzyme abnormalities <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">LIPTRUZET</span></p><p>Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>In a LIPTRUZET (ezetimibe and atorvastatin) placebo-controlled clinical trial, 628 patients (age range 18-86 years, 59% women, 85% Caucasians, 6% Blacks, 5% Hispanics, 3% Asians) with a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, 6% of patients on LIPTRUZET and 5% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions in the group treated with LIPTRUZET that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Myalgia (0.8%)</li>
<li>Abdominal pain (0.8%)</li>
<li>Increased hepatic enzymes (0.8%)</li>
</ul><p>The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥2% and greater than placebo) in this trial were: increased ALT (5%), increased AST (4%), and musculoskeletal pain (4%).</p><p>LIPTRUZET has been evaluated for safety in 2403 patients in 7 clinical trials (one placebo-controlled trial and six active-controlled trials).</p><p>Table 2 summarizes the frequency of clinical adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients treated with LIPTRUZET (n=255) and at an incidence greater than placebo, regardless of causality assessment, from the placebo-controlled trial.</p><p>After completing the 12-week study, eligible patients were assigned to coadministered ezetimibe and atorvastatin equivalent to LIPTRUZET (10/10-10/80) or atorvastatin (10-80 mg/day) for an additional 48 weeks. The long-term coadministration of ezetimibe plus atorvastatin had an overall safety profile similar to that of atorvastatin alone.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Ezetimibe</span></p><p>In 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, 2396 patients with primary hyperlipidemia (age range 9-86 years, 50% women, 90% Caucasians, 5% Blacks, 3% Hispanics, 2% Asians) and elevated LDL-C were treated with ezetimibe 10 mg/day for a median treatment duration of 12 weeks (range 0 to 39 weeks).</p><p>Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients treated with ezetimibe and at an incidence greater than placebo regardless of causality assessment are shown in Table 3.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Atorvastatin</span></p><p>In an atorvastatin placebo-controlled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 atorvastatin vs. 7311 placebo; age range 10–93 years, 39% women, 91% Caucasians, 3% Blacks, 2% Asians, 4% other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7% of patients on atorvastatin and 9.5% of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality.</p><p>The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥2% and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with atorvastatin in placebo controlled trials (n=8755) were: nasopharyngitis (8.3%), arthralgia (6.9%), diarrhea (6.8%), pain in extremity (6.0%), and urinary tract infection (5.7%).</p><p>Table 4 summarizes the frequency of clinical adverse reactions, regardless of causality, reported in ≥2% and at a rate greater than placebo in patients treated with atorvastatin (n=8755), from seventeen placebo-controlled trials.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">Because the reactions below are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>The additional events described below have been identified during post-approval use of ezetimibe and/or atorvastatin.</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood and lymphatic system disorders:</span> thrombocytopenia</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous system disorders:</span> headache; paresthesia; peripheral neuropathy</p><p>There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks).</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal disorders:</span> pancreatitis</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:</span> angioedema; bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis); rash; urticaria</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:</span> myopathy/rhabdomyolysis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></p><p>There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Injury, poisoning and procedural complications:</span> tendon rupture</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune system disorders:</span> anaphylaxis; hypersensitivity reactions</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatobiliary disorders:</span> hepatitis; cholelithiasis; cholecystitis; fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric disorders:</span> depression</p><p><span class="Italics">Laboratory abnormalities:</span> elevated creatine phosphokinase</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">[See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">LIPTRUZET</span></p><p>The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Strong Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4</h3><p class="First">Atorvastatin is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of atorvastatin with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP3A4. Because LIPTRUZET contains atorvastatin, the risk of myopathy during treatment with LIPTRUZET is increased with concurrent administration of:</p><h3>Cyclosporine</h3><p class="First">Atorvastatin and atorvastatin-metabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mg/kg/day compared to that of atorvastatin alone <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>In addition, ezetimibe and cyclosporine used concomitantly can increase exposure to both ezetimibe and cyclosporine. The degree of increase in ezetimibe exposure may be greater in patients with severe renal impairment.</p><p>The coadministration of LIPTRUZET with cyclosporine should be avoided <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Grapefruit Juice</h3><p class="First">Grapefruit juice contains one or more components that inhibit CYP3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (&gt;1.2 liters per day).</p><h3>Gemfibrozil</h3><p class="First">Due to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of LIPTRUZET with gemfibrozil should be avoided <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Fenofibrates (e.g., fenofibrate and fenofibric acid)</h3><p class="First">Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of fenofibrates, LIPTRUZET should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with a fenofibrate <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>Fenofibrates may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis. If cholelithiasis is suspected in a patient receiving LIPTRUZET and a fenofibrate, gallbladder studies are indicated and alternative lipid-lowering therapy should be considered <span class="Italics">[see the product labeling for fenofibrate and fenofibric acid]</span>.</p><h3>Niacin</h3><p class="First">The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when LIPTRUZET is used in combination with niacin; a reduction in LIPTRUZET dosage should be considered in this setting <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Digoxin</h3><p class="First">When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.</p><h3>Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking LIPTRUZET.</p><h3>Rifampin or Other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration of atorvastatin with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous coadministration of LIPTRUZET with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of atorvastatin after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations.</p><h3>Colchicine</h3><p class="First">Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing LIPTRUZET with colchicine.</p><h3>Cholestyramine</h3><p class="First">Concomitant cholestyramine administration decreased the mean area under the curve (AUC) of total ezetimibe approximately 55%. The incremental LDL-C reduction due to adding ezetimibe to cholestyramine may be reduced by this interaction.</p><h3>Coumarin Anticoagulants</h3><p class="First">If LIPTRUZET is added to warfarin, a coumarin anticoagulant, the International Normalized Ratio (INR) should be appropriately monitored.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category X</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">[See Contraindications (4).]</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">LIPTRUZET</span></p><p>LIPTRUZET is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid-lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy, because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on long-term outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy.</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of LIPTRUZET use during pregnancy. There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deaths/stillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a three-to-four-fold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence.

LIPTRUZET contains ezetimibe and atorvastatin, two lipid-lowering compounds with complementary mechanisms of action.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Ezetimibe</span></p><p>Ezetimibe reduces blood cholesterol by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol by the small intestine. The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. In a 2-week clinical study in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. Ezetimibe had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production.</p><p>Ezetimibe does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver or increase bile acid excretion. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood; this distinct mechanism is complementary to that of statins <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Atorvastatin</span></p><p>In animal models, atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell-surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL; atorvastatin also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of total-C, LDL-C and Apo B, the major protein constituent of LDL, promote human atherosclerosis. In addition, decreased levels of HDL-C are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic studies have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of total-C and LDL-C and inversely with the level of HDL-C. Like LDL, cholesterol-enriched triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. The independent effect of raising HDL-C or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</p><p>Atorvastatin as well as some of its metabolites are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDL-C reduction.

They then crossed over, after a 6-week washout, to the coadministered components or LIPTRUZET at corresponding doses for an additional 6 weeks. From untreated baseline, mean changes in LDL-C for LIPTRUZET vs. the coadministered components, respectively, were -54.0% vs. -53.8% for 10/20-mg (Study 1), and -58.9% vs. -58.7% for 10/40-mg (Study 2). Mean changes for total-C, Apo B, TG, non-HDL-C, and HDL-C were also similar between the two treatment groups and supported the conclusion of clinical equivalence.</p><h3>Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)</h3><p class="First">A double-blind, randomized, 12-week study was performed in patients with a clinical and/or genotypic diagnosis of HoFH. Data were analyzed from a subgroup of patients (n=36) receiving atorvastatin 40 mg at baseline. Increasing the dose of atorvastatin from 40 to 80 mg (n=12) produced a reduction of LDL-C of 2% from baseline on atorvastatin 40 mg. Coadministered ezetimibe and atorvastatin equivalent to LIPTRUZET (10/40 and 10/80 pooled, n=24), produced a reduction of LDL-C of 19% from baseline on atorvastatin 40 mg. In those patients coadministered ezetimibe and atorvastatin equivalent to LIPTRUZET (10/80, n=12), a reduction of LDL-C of 25% from baseline on atorvastatin 40 mg was produced.</p><p>After completing the 12-week study, eligible patients (n=35), who were receiving atorvastatin 40 mg at baseline, were assigned to coadministered ezetimibe and atorvastatin equivalent to LIPTRUZET 10/40 for up to an additional 24 months. Following at least 4 weeks of treatment, the atorvastatin dose could be doubled to a maximum dose of 80 mg.</p><p>At the end of the 24 months, LIPTRUZET (10/40 and 10/80 pooled) produced a reduction of LDL-C that was consistent with that seen in the 12-week study.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Tablets LIPTRUZET 10 mg/10 mg are white to off-white capsule-shaped, biconvex film-coated tablets with code "320" on one side.</p><p>They are supplied as follows:</p><p>NDC 66582-320-30 unit of use packages of 30 (three foil pouches each containing one 10-count blister card)</p><p>NDC 66582-320-54 unit of use packages of 90 (nine foil pouches each containing one 10-count blister card)</p><p>Tablets LIPTRUZET 10 mg/20 mg are white to off-white round, biconvex film-coated tablets with code "321" on one side.</p><p>They are supplied as follows:</p><p>NDC 66582-321-30 unit of use packages of 30 (three foil pouches each containing one 10-count blister card)</p><p>NDC 66582-321-54 unit of use packages of 90 (nine foil pouches each containing one 10-count blister card)</p><p>Tablets LIPTRUZET 10 mg/40 mg are white to off-white oval, biconvex film-coated tablets with code "322" on one side.</p><p>They are supplied as follows:</p><p>NDC 66582-322-30 unit of use packages of 30 (three foil pouches each containing one 10-count blister card)</p><p>NDC 66582-322-54 unit of use packages of 90 (nine foil pouches each containing one 10-count blister card)</p><p>Tablets LIPTRUZET 10 mg/80 mg are white to off-white capsule-shaped, biconvex film-coated tablets with code "323" on one side.</p><p>They are supplied as follows:</p><p>NDC 66582-323-30 unit of use packages of 30 (three foil pouches each containing one 10-count blister card)</p><p>NDC 66582-323-54 unit of use packages of 90 (nine foil pouches each containing one 10-count blister card)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Storage of Unit of Use Packages of 30 and 90</span></p><p>Store LIPTRUZET at 20-25°C (68-77°F), excursions permitted to 15-30°C (59-86°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].
