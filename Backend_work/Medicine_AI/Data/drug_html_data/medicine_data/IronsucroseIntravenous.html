When the body does not get enough iron, it cannot produce the number of normal red blood cells needed to keep you in good health. This condition is called iron deficiency (iron shortage) or iron deficiency anemia.</p><p>Iron sucrose is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using iron sucrose</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
