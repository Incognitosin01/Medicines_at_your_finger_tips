Affected by light, it is slightly soluble in water; freely soluble in alcohol; sparingly soluble in ether.</p><h2>URO-MP Capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">METHENAMINE degrades in an acidic urine environment releasing formaldehyde which provides bactericidal or bacteriostatic action. It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. 70 to 90% reaches the urine unchanged at which point it is hydrolyzed if the urine is acidic. Within 24 hours it is almost completely (90%) excreted; of this amount at pH 5, approximately 20% is formaldehyde. Protein binding - some formaldehyde is bound to substances in the urine and surrounding tissues. Methenamine is freely distributed to body tissue and fluids but is not clinically significant as it does not hydrolyze at a pH greater than 6.8.</p><p>SODIUM PHOSPHATE MONOBASIC an acidifier, helps to maintain an acid pH in the urine necessary for the degradation of methenamine.</p><p>PHENYL SALICYLATE releases salicylate, a mild analgesic for pain.</p><p>METHYLENE BLUE possesses weak antiseptic properties. It is well absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly reduced to leukomethylene blue which is stabilized in some combination form in the urine. 75% is excreted unchanged.</p><p>HYOSCYAMINE SULFATE is a parasympatholytic drug which relaxes smooth muscles and thus produces an antispasmodic effect. It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly distributed throughout the body tissues. Most is excreted in the urine within 12 hours, 13% to 50% being unchanged. Protein binding for hyoscyamine sulfate is moderate and biotransformation is hepatic.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for URO-MP Capsules</h2><p class="First">URO-MP Capsules are indicated for the treatment of symptoms of irritative voiding.</p><p>Indicated for the relief of local symptoms, such as inflammation, hypermotility, and pain, which accompany lower urinary tract infections.</p><p>Indicated for the relief of urinary tract symptoms caused by diagnostic procedures.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">URO-MP Capsules are contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. Risk-benefit should be considered when the following medical problems exist: Cardiac disease (especially cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, and mitral stenosis); gastrointestinal tract obstructive disease; glaucoma; myasthenia gravis; acute urinary retention may be precipitated in obstructive uropathy (such as bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy).</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Do not exceed recommended dosage. If rapid pulse, dizziness, or blurring of vision occurs, discontinue use immediately.</p><p>KEEP THIS AND ALL MEDICATIONS OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.</p><p>IN CASE OF ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE, SEEK PROFESSIONAL ASSISTANCE OR CONTACT A POISON CONTROL CENTER IMMEDIATELY.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Cross sensitivity and/or related problems:<br/>
Patients intolerant of other belladonna alkaloids or other salicylates may be intolerant of this medication also. Delay in gastric emptying could complicate the management of gastric ulcers.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Reproduction (FDA Pregnancy Category C):</h3><p class="First">Hyoscyamine and methenamine cross the placenta. Studies have not been done in either animals or humans. It is not known whether URO-MP Capsules can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.  URO-MP Capsules should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing mothers:</h3><p class="First">Methenamine and traces of hyoscyamine are excreted in breast milk. Caution should be exercised when URO-MP Capsules are administered to a nursing mother.</p><p>Prolonged use:<br/>
There have been no studies to establish the safety of prolonged use in humans. No known long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p><h3>Pediatric:</h3><p class="First">Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effect of the belladonna alkaloids.</p><h3>Geriatric:</h3><p class="First">Use with caution in elderly patients as they may respond to the usual doses of the belladonna alkaloids with excitement, agitation, drowsiness, or confusion.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Cardiovascular - rapid pulse, flushing</p><p>Central Nervous System - blurred vision, dizziness, drowsiness</p><p>Respiratory - shortness of breath or troubled breathing</p><p>Genitourinary - difficult micturition, acute urinary retention</p><p>Gastrointestinal -dry mouth, nausea and vomiting</p><p>Serious allergic reactions to this drug are rare. Seek immediate medical attention if you notice symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including itching, rash, severe dizziness, swelling or trouble breathing.</p><p>This medication can cause urine and sometimes stools to turn blue to blue-green. This effect is harmless and will subside after medication is stopped.</p><p>Call your doctor or physician for medical advice about side effects. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Method Pharmaceuticals, LLC at (877) 250-3427.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">As a result of hyoscyamine's effects on gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying, absorption of other oral medications may be decreased during concurrent use with this combination medication.</p><p>Urinary alkalizers and thiazide diuretics: May cause the urine to become alkaline reducing the effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde.</p><p>Antimuscarinics: Concurrent use may intensify antimuscarinic effects of hyoscyamine because of secondary antimuscarinic activities of these medications.</p><p>Antacids/antidiarrheals: Concurrent use may reduce absorption of hyoscyamine resulting in decreased therapeutic effectiveness. Concurrent use with antacids may cause urine to become alkaline reducing the effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde. Doses of these medications should be spaced 1 hour apart from doses of hyoscyamine.</p><p>Antimyasthenics: Concurrent use with hyoscyamine may further reduce intestinal motility, therefore, caution is recommended.</p><p>Ketoconazole and hyoscyamine may cause increased gastrointestinal pH.</p><p>Concurrent administration with hyoscyamine may result in marked reduction in the absorption of ketoconazole. Patients should be advised to take this combination at least 2 hours after ketoconazole.</p><p>Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors: Concurrent use with hyoscyamine may intensify antimuscarinic side effects.</p><p>Opioid (narcotic) analgesics may result in increased risk of severe constipation.</p><p>Sulfonamides: These drugs may precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine increasing the danger of crystalluria.</p><p>Patients should be advised that the urine and/or stools may become blue to blue-green as a result of the excretion of methylene blue.</p><h3>Drug Abuse And Dependence</h3><p class="First">A dependence on the use of URO-MP Capsules has not been reported and due to the nature of its ingredients, abuse of URO-MP Capsules is not expected.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Emesis or gastric lavage. Slow intravenous administration of physostigmine in doses of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in children) repeated as needed in one to two hours to reverse severe antimuscarinic symptoms. </p><p>Administration of small doses of diazepam to control excitement and seizures.</p><p>Artificial respiration with oxygen if needed for respiratory depression. </p><p>Adequate hydration. </p><p>Symptomatic treatment as necessary.</p><p>If overdose is suspected, contact the poison control center at 1-800-222-1222, or your local emergency room immediately.</p><h2>URO-MP Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Adults: One tablet orally 4 times per day followed by liberal fluid intake. </p><p>Pediatric: Dosage must be individualized by physician for older children.
