Leukemia cells, especially lymphoblasts, require exogenous asparagine; normal cells can synthesize asparagine. Asparagine depletion in leukemic cells leads to inhibition of protein synthesis and apoptosis. Asparaginase is cycle-specific for the G<sub>1</sub> phase.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>IV: Slightly higher than plasma volume; &lt;1% CSF penetration </p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Systemically degraded</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>IM: 14 to 24 hours</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>IM: 34 to 49 hours; IV: 8 to 30 hours </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia:</b> Treatment (remission induction) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (in combination with other chemotherapy).</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Lymphoblastic lymphoma</h3><p>Data from small study supports the use of asparaginase (<i>Escherichia</i><i> coli</i>) (as part of the Hyper-CVAD combination chemotherapy regimen) in the treatment of lymphoblastic lymphoma <sup>[Thomas 2004]</sup>.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to asparaginase (<i>Escherichia</i> <i>coli</i>) or any component of the formulation; severe hepatic impairment, severe pancreatitis (current or past), recent yellow fever vaccination, concurrent use with phenytoin.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Dose, frequency, number of doses, and start date may vary by protocol and treatment phase.</p><p><b>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL): </b></p><p>Daily administration: Induction: IM, IV: 200 to 1,000 units/kg/day for 28 consecutive days; continue induction therapy for an additional 14 days if not in remission or begin maintenance therapy if in remission (Canadian labeling)</p><p>Intermittent administration: Induction: IM, IV: 400 units/kg on Monday and Wednesday and 600 units/kg on Friday; repeat weekly for 4 weeks; continue induction therapy for an additional 2 weeks if not in remission or begin maintenance therapy if in remission (Canadian labeling)</p><p><i>CALGB-8811 regimen (off-label dosing):</i> SubQ: 6,000 units/m<sup>2</sup>/dose on days 5, 8, 11, 15, 18, and 22 (induction phase) and on days 15, 18, 22, and 25 (early intensification phase) (Larson 1995)</p><p><i>Hyper-CVAD </i><i>regimen (off-label dosing):</i> IV: 20,000 units weekly for 4 doses (starting on day 2) during either months 7 and 19 or months 7 and 11 of intensification phase (Thomas 2010)</p><p><i>Linker regimen (off-label dosing):</i> IM:</p><p>Remission induction: 6,000 units/m<sup>2</sup>/dose on days 17 to 28; if bone marrow on day 28 is positive for residual leukemia: 6,000 units/m<sup>2</sup>/dose on days 29 to 35 (Linker 1991)</p><p>Consolidation (Treatment A; cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7): 12,000 units/m<sup>2</sup>/dose on days 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14 (Linker 1991)</p><p><b>Lymphoblastic lymphoma (off-label use):</b> Hyper-CVAD regimen: IV: 20,000 units weekly for 4 doses (starting on day 2) for 2 cycles (months 7 and 11) during maintenance phase (Thomas 2004)</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Dose, frequency, number of doses, and start date may vary by protocol and treatment phase.</p><p><b>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL):</b> Children and Adolescents: Refer to adult dosing.</p><p><i>CCG 1922 protocol (off-label dosing):</i> IM: 6,000 units/m<sup>2</sup>/dose 3 times weekly for 9 doses beginning either on day 2, 3, or 4 (induction phase) and 6,000 units/m<sup>2</sup>/dose on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 6 doses beginning day 3 (delayed intensification phase) (Bostrom 2004)</p><p><i>DFCI-ALL Consortium protocol 00-01 (off-label dosing):</i> IM: 25,000 units/m<sup>2</sup> for 1 dose (induction phase) and 25,000 units/m<sup>2</sup>/dose weekly for 30 weeks (intensification phase) (Vrooman 2013)</p><p><i>DFCI-ALL Consortium protocol 95-01 (off-label dosing):</i> IM: 25,000 units/m<sup>2</sup> for 1 dose on day 4 (induction phase) and 25,000 units/m<sup>2</sup>/dose weekly for 20 weeks (intensification phase) (Moghrabi 2007)</p><p><i>Hyper-CVAD regimen (off-label dosing):</i> Adolescents ≥13 years: Refer to adult dosing.</p><p><b>Lymphoblastic lymphoma (off-label use):</b> Adolescents &gt;15 years: Refer to adult dosing.</p><p><b>Dosing adjustment for toxicity: </b></p><p>Manufacturer labeling: Children and Adolescents:</p><p>Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity: Discontinue for severe reactions.</p><p>Neurotoxicity (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [PRES]): Interrupt therapy for suspected PRES; control blood pressure and closely monitor for seizure activity.</p><p>Pancreatitis: Discontinue permanently.</p><p>Thrombotic event: Discontinue for serious reactions.</p><p>The following adjustments have also been recommended (Stock 2011): Older Adolescents:</p><p><i>Hyperammonemia-related fatigue:</i> Continue therapy for grade 2 toxicity.

For IM administration, the US manufacturer recommended reconstitution of the lyophilized powder with 2 mL NS to a concentration of 5,000 units/mL; however, some institutions reconstitute with 1 mL NS for IM use, resulting in a concentration of 10,000 units/mL. Shake well, but not too vigorously. A 5 micron filter may be used to remove fiber-like particles in the solution (do not use a 0.2 micron filter; has been associated with loss of potency).</p><p><b>Standard IM dilution: </b> 5,000 units/mL (10,000 units/mL has been used by some institutions)</p><p><b>Standard IV dilution:</b> Dilute in 50 to 250 mL NS or D<sub>5</sub>W</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IM, IV: May be administered IM (preferred for intermittent administration) or IV; has been administered SubQ (off-label route; Larson 1995) in specific protocols. May administer corticosteroids 1 to 2 days prior to initiating reinduction therapy (to prevent hypersensitivity reaction). Observe patients for 1 hour after administration; have epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and hydrocortisone at the bedside. A physician should be readily accessible.</p><p>IM: Doses should be given as a deep IM injection into a large muscle; volumes &gt;2 mL should be divided and administered in 2 separate sites.</p><p>IV: Infuse over ≥30 minutes through the side arm of a NS or D5W infusion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store intact vials at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 48°F). Reconstituted solution should be used immediately after preparation, although is stable for 3 hours at room temperature or 72 hours refrigerated. Solutions diluted for infusion should be used immediately; if not used immediately, may be stored for up to 72 hours refrigerated (diluted with NS), or up to 24 hours (diluted with D5W).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>DexAMETHasone (Systemic): Asparaginase (E. coli) may increase the serum concentration of DexAMETHasone (Systemic). This is thought to be due to an asparaginase-related decrease in hepatic proteins responsible for dexamethasone metabolism. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.

Observe for reactions following administration; reactions generally occur 30 to 60 minutes following administration (although may also occur beyond that time). Immediate treatment for hypersensitivity reactions should be available during administration. Discontinue asparaginase if serious allergic reaction occurs. Prior exposure to asparaginase is a risk factor for allergic reactions; IV administration (compared to IM or SubQ administration) and younger age also may be associated with hypersensitivity reactions (Stock 2011; Woo 2000). Patients who have an allergic reaction to <i>Escherichia</i><i> coli</i> asparaginase may also react to asparaginase (<i>Erwinia</i>) or to pegaspargase.</p><p>• Coagulopathy: Increased prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and hypofibrinogenemia may occur; cerebrovascular thrombosis and hemorrhage have been reported; monitor coagulation parameters at baseline and periodically during and after therapy. Use with caution in patients with an underlying coagulopathy. Replacement therapy should be instituted if fibrinogen &lt;1g/L or ATIII &lt;60%; if ineffective, asparaginase treatment should preferably be suspended and resumed only when the laboratory parameters have normalized.</p><p>• Hepatotoxicity: <b>[Canadian Boxed Warning]: Adverse effects on liver function may be observed including exacerbation of preexisting liver impairment (due to prior therapy or underlying disease). Physicians should carefully consider therapeutic benefits versus toxicity risks.</b> Altered liver function tests (eg, increased AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and decreased serum albumin, plasma fibrinogen) may occur; fulminant hepatic failure has also occurred. Fatty liver may be observed on biopsy. Use with caution and monitor liver function tests at least weekly during therapy; discontinue therapy for any significant changes.</p><p>• Hyperammonemia: Asparaginase may induce excessive ammonia production; monitor for signs of metabolic encephalopathy (confusion, stupor, coma).</p><p>• Hyperglycemia: Asparaginase may cause hyperglycemia/glucose intolerance (may be irreversible); cases of diabetic ketoacidosis have been observed. Monitor blood glucose as clinically necessary. Hyperglycemia may require antihyperglycemic therapy and/or therapy discontinuation.</p><p>• Neurotoxicity: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been observed in patients treated with asparaginase (in combination with other chemotherapy agents). Monitor for signs/symptoms of PRES (eg, altered mental status, headache, hypertension, seizures, visual disturbances); interrupt therapy for suspected PRES. Control blood pressure and closely monitor for seizure activity.</p><p>• Pancreatitis: <b>[Canadian Boxed Warning]: </b><b>May cause serious and possibly fulminant or fatal pancreatitis;</b> promptly evaluate patients with abdominal pain. May consider continuing therapy for asymptomatic chemical pancreatitis (amylase or lipase &gt;3 times ULN) or only radiologic abnormalities; monitor closely for rising amylase and/or lipase levels (Stock 2011). Discontinue permanently for clinical pancreatitis (eg, vomiting, severe abdominal pain) with amylase/lipase elevation &gt;3 times ULN for &gt;3 days and/or development of a pancreatic pseudocyst. Avoid alcohol use (Stock 2011).</p><p>• Thrombotic events: Serious thrombosis, including sagittal sinus thrombosis may occur; discontinue with serious thrombotic events. Anticoagulation prophylaxis during therapy may be considered in some patients (Farge 2013). The risk for thrombosis may be higher in adult patients (Stock 2011).</p><p>• Tumor lysis syndrome: Appropriate measures must be taken to prevent tumor lysis syndrome and subsequent hyperuricemia and uric acid nephropathy; monitor, consider antihyperuricemic therapy, hydration and urinary alkalization.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Antibody formation: Development of neutralizing antibodies has been reported with repeated dosing and is associated with reduced L-asparaginase activity. Monitor L-asparaginase activity levels in serum or plasma; consider switching to another asparaginase preparation if antibodies develop.</p><p>• Experienced physician: <b>[Canadian Boxed Warning]: Should be administered under the supervision of an experienced cancer chemotherapy physician in a setting where full resuscitative facilities are immediately available.</b></p><p>• Medication error prevention: Do not interchange <i>E. coli</i> asparaginase for <i>Erwinia</i> asparaginase, calaspargase pegol, or pegaspargase; ensure the proper formulation, route of administration, and dose prior to administration. The <i>E. coli</i> and the <i>Erwinia</i> strains of asparaginase differ slightly in their gene sequencing and have slight differences in their enzyme characteristics. Both are highly specific for asparagine and have &lt;10% activity for the D-isomer.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential, amylase, lipase, triglycerides, liver function prior to and weekly during therapy, coagulation parameters (baseline and prior to each injection), blood glucose, renal function, uric acid. Monitor for allergic reaction; monitor for onset of abdominal pain and mental status changes. Monitor vital signs during administration.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Per the manufacturer, females of reproductive potential should avoid pregnancy during chemotherapy, and males should not father a child during chemotherapy and for a period of time after the last dose of asparaginase (<i>E. coli</i>).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Based on data from animal reproduction studies, in utero exposure to asparaginase (<i>E. coli</i>) may cause fetal harm.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat a type of leukemia.</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
