In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ of mesalamine toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.2</span><span class="Italics">), Nonclinical Toxicology (</span><span class="Italics">13.2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p>Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of Canasa and periodically while on therapy.</p><p> </p><p>Evaluate the risks and benefits of using Canasa in patients with known renal impairment or a history of renal disease or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs <span class="Italics">[</span><span class="Italics">s</span><span class="Italics">ee Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7.1</span><span class="Italics">)</span><span class="Italics">,</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.6</span><span class="Italics">)</span><span class="Italics">].</span></p><h3>5.2 Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome</h3><p class="First">      Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, malaise, pruritis, conjunctivitis, and rash. Monitor patients for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with Canasa.</p><h3>5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">               Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some patients may have a similar reaction to Canasa or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine.</p><p>      As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue Canasa if an alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established. </p><h3>5.4 Hepatic Failure</h3><p class="First">      There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered other products containing mesalamine. Evaluate the risks and benefits of using Canasa in patients with known liver impairment.<span class="Bold"> </span></p><h3>5.5 Photosensitivity</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">In patients treated with mesalamine or sulfasalazine who have pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors.</span></p><h3>5.6 Nephrolithiasis</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with the use of mesalamine, including stones of 100% mesalamine content. Mesalamine-containing stones are radiotransparent and undetectable by standard radiography or computed tomography (CT). Ensure adequate hydration during treatment with Canasa.</span></p><h3>5.7 Interaction with Laboratory Test for Urinary Normetanephrine</h3><p class="First">      Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine. </p><h2>6 ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">The following serious or clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling:</span></p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>6.1 Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">      Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p> </p><p>      The most common adverse reactions in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are summarized in the Table 1 below.</p><p>      In a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients comparing the Canasa 1000 mg suppository administered nightly to that of the mesalamine 500 mg suppository twice daily. The most common adverse reactions in both groups were headache (14%), flatulence (5%), abdominal pain (5%), diarrhea (3%), and nausea (3%). Three (3) patients discontinued medication because of an adverse reaction; one of these adverse reactions (headache) was deemed possibly related to study medication.   The recommended dosage of Canasa is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2</span><span class="Italics">)].</span> </p><h3>6.2 Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Canasa or other mesalamine-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS</h2><h3>7.1 Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs</h3><p class="First">      The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.1</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>7.2 Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine</h3><p class="First">The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and/or other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of Canasa and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts.</p><h3>7.3 Interference With Urinary Normetanephrine Measurements</h3><p class="First">      Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.7</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h2>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>8.1 Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>      Limited published data on mesalamine use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. No evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits when treated during gestation with orally administered mesalamine at doses greater than the recommended human intra-rectal dose <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">see Data</span><span class="Italics">)</span>.</p><p> </p><p>      The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>      Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of Canasa, based on body surface area) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 495 mg/kg/day (about 5.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of Canasa, based on body surface area) following administration during the period of organogenesis, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to mesalamine.</p><h3>8.2 Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>      Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk in undetectable to small amounts <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">see Data</span><span class="Italics">)</span>. There are limited reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants. There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of Canasa to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Canasa and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Canasa or from the underlying maternal conditions.  </p><p> </p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Monitor breastfed infants for diarrhea.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid.</p><h3>8.4 Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">              The safety and effectiveness of Canasa in pediatric patients for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis have not been established. Canasa was evaluated for the treatment of ulcerative proctitis in a 6-week, open-label, single-arm study in 49 patients 5 to 17 years of age, which only included 14 patients with histologically-confirmed cases of ulcerative proctitis. However, efficacy was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients in this trial (abdominal pain, headache, pyrexia, pharyngolaryngeal pain, diarrhea and vomiting) were similar to those seen in adult patients.</p><h3>8.5 Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First"> </p><p>Clinical trials of Canasa did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia and pancytopenia) in patients receiving mesalamine-containing products such as Canasa who were 65 years or older compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with Canasa. In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concurrent disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing Canasa <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.6</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>8.6 Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">            Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on Canasa therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.1</span><span class="Italics">), Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7.1</span><span class="Italics">) and Adverse Reactions</span> (<span class="Italics">6.2</span>)<span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h2>10 OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mesalamine absorption from the colon is limited; however, Canasa is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, tachypnea, hyperpnea, tinnitus, and neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, seizures). Severe salicylate intoxication may lead to electrolyte and blood pH imbalance and potentially to other organ (e.g., renal and liver) involvement. There is no specific antidote for mesalamine overdose. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance by the administration of appropriate intravenous therapy and maintain adequate renal function.</span></p><h2>11 DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">The active ingredient in Canasa 1000 mg suppositories for rectal use is mesalamine, also known as mesalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Chemically, mesalamine is 5-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, and is classified as an aminosalicylate. Each Canasa rectal suppository contains 1000 mg of mesalamine (USP) in a base of Hard Fat, NF.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">7</span>H<span class="Sub">7</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span>, representing a molecular weight of 153.14. The structural formula is:</span></p><p></p><h2>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to be a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon.</p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"> <span class="Bold">Absorption</span> </p><p>      Mesalamine (5-ASA) administered as a rectal suppository is variably absorbed. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppositories, administered once every eight hours for six days, the mean mesalamine peak<span class="Bold"> </span>plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 353 ng/mL (CV=55%) following the initial dose and 361 ng/mL (CV=67%) at steady state. The mean minimum steady state plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">min</span>) was 89 ng/mL (CV=89%). Absorbed mesalamine does not accumulate in the plasma.</p><p> </p><p> <span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>      Mesalamine administered as a rectal suppository distributes in rectal tissue to some extent.</p><p> <span class="Bold">Elimination</span><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>      In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, the mean elimination half-life was 5 hours (CV=73%) for 5-ASA and 5 hours (CV=63%) for N-acetyl-5-ASA, the active metabolite, following the initial  dose. At steady state, the mean elimination half-life was 7 hours for both 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-ASA (CV=102% for 5-ASA and 82% for N-acetyl-5-ASA).</p><p> <span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>      The absorbed mesalamine is extensively metabolized, mainly to N-acetyl-5-ASA in the liver and in the gut mucosal wall. In patients with ulcerative colitis treated with one mesalamine 500 mg rectal suppository every eight hours for six days, the peak concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of N-acetyl-5-ASA ranged from 467 ng/mL to 1399 ng/mL following the initial dose and from 193 ng/mL to 1304 ng/mL at steady state.</p><p> <span class="Italics">Excretion</span> </p><p>      Mesalamine is eliminated from plasma mainly by urinary excretion, predominantly as N-acetyl-5-ASA. In patients with ulcerative proctitis treated with mesalamine 500 mg as a rectal suppository every 8 hours for 6 days, 12% or less of the dose was eliminated in urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 8% to 77% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA following the initial dose. At steady state, 11% or less of the dose was eliminated in the urine as unchanged 5-ASA and 3% to 35% was eliminated as N-acetyl-5-ASA.</p><h2>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><h3>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">      Mesalamine caused no increase in the incidence of neoplastic lesions over controls in a two-year study of Wistar rats fed up to 320 mg/kg/day of mesalamine admixed with diet (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of Canasa, based on body surface area).</p><p>      Mesalamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (TK<span class="Sup">+/-</span>) forward mutation test, or the mouse micronucleus test.</p><p>      No effects on fertility or reproductive performance of the male and female rats were observed at oral mesalamine doses up to 320 mg/kg/day (about 1.7 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of Canasa, based on body surface area).</p><h3>13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">      Toxicology studies of mesalamine were conducted in rats, mice, rabbits and dogs, and the kidney was the main target organ of toxicity. In rats, adverse renal effects were observed at a single oral dose of 600 mg/kg (about 3.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of Canasa, based on body surface area) and at intravenous doses of &gt;214 mg/kg (about 1.2 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of Canasa, based on body surface area). In a 13-week oral gavage toxicity study in rats, papillary necrosis and/or multifocal tubular injury were observed in males receiving 160 mg/kg (about 0.86 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of Canasa, based on body surface area) and in both males and females at 640 mg/kg (about 3.5 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of Canasa, based on body surface area). In a combined 52-week toxicity and 127-week carcinogenicity study in rats, degeneration of the kidneys and hyalinization of basement membranes and Bowman’s capsule were observed at oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day (about 0.54 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of Canasa, based on body surface area) and above. In a 14-day rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in rabbits, intra-rectal doses up to 800 mg/kg (about 8.6 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of Canasa, based on body surface area) was not associated with any adverse effects. In a six-month oral toxicity study in dogs, doses of 80 mg/kg (about 1.4 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of Canasa, based on body surface area) and higher caused renal pathology similar to that described for the rat. In a rectal toxicity study of mesalamine suppositories in dogs, a dose of 166.6 mg/kg (about 3 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of Canasa, based on body surface area) produced chronic nephritis and pyelitis. In the 12-month eye toxicity study in dogs, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) occurred at oral doses of 40 mg/kg (about 0.72 times the recommended human intra-rectal dose of Canasa, based on body surface area) and above.</p><h2>14 CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">      Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of mesalamine suppositories were conducted in North America in adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis. The regimen in Study 1 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally three times daily and in Study 2 was a 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily. In both trials, patients had an average extent of proctitis (upper disease boundary) of approximately 10 cm and approximately 80% of patients had multiple prior episodes of proctitis. A total of 173 patients were evaluated (Study 1, N=79; Study 2, N=94), of which 89 patients received mesalamine, and 84 patients received placebo. The mean age of patients was 39 years (range 17 to 73 years), 60% were female, and 97% were white.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">      The primary measures of efficacy were clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations in both trials. The DAI is a composite index reflecting rectal bleeding, stool frequency, mucosal appearance at endoscopy, and a physician’s global assessment of disease. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">      Compared to placebo, mesalamine suppositories were statistically (p&lt;0.01) superior to placebo in both trials with respect to improvement in stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, disease severity, and overall disease activity after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. The effectiveness of mesalamine suppositories was statistically significant irrespective of sex, extent of proctitis, duration of current episode, or duration of disease.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">      An additional multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study in 99 patients diagnosed with mildly to moderately ulcerative proctitis compared 1000 mg Canasa administered rectally once daily at bedtime (N=35) to 500 mg mesalamine suppository administered rectally twice daily, in the morning and at bedtime (N=46), for 6 weeks.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">      The primary measures of efficacy included the clinical disease activity index (DAI) and histologic evaluations. Patients were evaluated clinically and sigmoidoscopically at 3 and 6 weeks of treatment.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">      The efficacy at 6 weeks was not different between the treatment groups. Both were effective in the treatment of ulcerative proctitis and resulted in a significant decrease at 6 weeks in DAI: in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.6 to 1.6, and in the 1000 mg at bedtime group, the mean DAI value decreased from 6.2 to 1.3, which represents a decrease of greater than 75% in both groups. After 6 weeks of treatment, a DAI score of less than 3 was achieved in 78% of patients in the mesalamine 500 mg twice daily group and 86% of patients in the Canasa 1000 mg once daily group. The recommended dosage of Canasa is 1000 mg administered rectally once daily at bedtime <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></span></p><h2>16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">      Canasa 1000 mg suppositories for rectal administration are available as bullet shaped, light tan to grey suppositories containing 1000 mg mesalamine supplied in boxes of 30 and 42 individually plastic wrapped suppositories (NDC 58914-501-56 and 58914-501-42).</span></p><p><span class="Bold">      Store below 25ºC (77ºF), may be refrigerated.
