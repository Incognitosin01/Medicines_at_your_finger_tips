Estrogens are female sex hormones made by a woman's ovaries that regulate many processes in the body.</p><p>Estrogel is a prescription medicine used to reduce certain symptoms of menopause such as moderate to severe hot flashes, and vaginal symptoms such as dryness, burning, and irritation.</p><p>Estrogel may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Estrogel if you have any of the following conditions: a history of heart attack, stroke, or blood clot, a bleeding or blood-clotting disorder, liver disease, abnormal vaginal bleeding, history of an allergic reaction to estradiol topical, or a hormone-related cancer such as breast or uterine cancer.</p><p><b>Do not use if you are pregnant.</b></p><p>Estradiol may increase your risk of developing a condition that may lead to uterine cancer. Call your doctor at once if you have any unusual vaginal bleeding while using Estrogel.</p><p>Children should avoid coming into contact with skin areas where you have applied Estrogel. <b>Topical estradiol is absorbed through the skin and can cause side effects in a child who comes into contact with this medicine or with skin where Estrogel was applied.</b></p><p>Estradiol should not be used to prevent heart disease, stroke, or dementia, because this medicine may actually increase your risk of developing these conditions.

<li>
<p>Before using the pump for the first time, it must be primed. Remove the large pump cover, and fully depress the pump twice for the 93-gram pump or three times for the 50-gram pump and the 25-gram pump. Discard the unused gel by thoroughly rinsing down the sink or placing it in the household trash in a manner that avoids accidental exposure or ingestion by household members or pets. After priming, the pump is ready to use, and one complete pump depression will dispense the same amount of Estrogel each time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply Estrogel at the same time each day. You should apply your daily dose of gel to clean, dry, unbroken skin. If you take a bath or shower or use a sauna, apply your Estrogel dose after your bath, shower, or sauna. If you go swimming, try to leave as much time as possible between applying your Estrogel dose and going swimming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be sure your skin is completely dry before applying Estrogel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To apply the dose, collect the Estrogel into the palm of your hand by pressing the pump firmly and fully with one fluid motion without hesitation.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Always place the small protective cap back on the tip of the pump and the large pump cover over the top of the pump after each use.</p>
