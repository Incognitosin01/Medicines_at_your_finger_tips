Acyclovir slows the growth and spread of the herpes virus in the body.</p><p>Zovirax is used to treat infections caused by herpes viruses, such as genital herpes, cold sores, shingles, and chickenpox.</p><p>Zovirax will not cure herpes, but it can lessen the symptoms of the infection.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Take Zovirax for the entire length of time prescribed by your doctor. Your symptoms may get better before the infection is completely treated.</p><p>Treatment with Zovirax should be started as soon as possible after the first appearance of symptoms (such as tingling, burning, blisters).</p><p>Herpes infections are contagious and you can infect other people, even while you are being treated with Zovirax. Avoid letting infected areas come into contact with other people. Avoid touching an infected area and then touching your eyes. Wash your hands frequently to prevent passing the infection to others.</p><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package. Tell each of your healthcare providers about all your medical conditions, allergies, and all medicines you use.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not take Zovirax if you are allergic to acyclovir or valacyclovir (Valtrex).</p><p>To make sure Zovirax is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
