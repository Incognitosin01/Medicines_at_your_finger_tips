Tell your doctor if you are pregnant.</p><p>Rifampin can make hormonal birth control less effective, including birth control pills, injections, implants, skin patches, and vaginal rings. To prevent pregnancy while using rifampin, use a barrier form of birth control: condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, or contraceptive sponge.</p><p>You should not breastfeed while using this medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use rifampin?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Rifampin oral is taken by mouth. Rifampin injection is given as an infusion into a vein.</p><p>Take rifampin <b>oral</b> on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Take each dose with a full glass of water.</p><p>A healthcare provider will give you rifampin injection. Tell your caregivers if you feel any burning, pain, or swelling around the IV needle when rifampin is injected.</p><p>Rifampin may cause temporary discoloration of your teeth, sweat, urine, saliva, and tears (a yellow, orange, red, or brown color).
