</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Nia-Chrom</h2><p>Chromium supplements are used to prevent or treat chromium deficiency.</p><p>The body needs chromium for normal growth and health. For patients who are unable to get enough chromium in their regular diet or who have a need for more chromium, chromium supplements may be necessary. They are generally taken by mouth but some patients may have to receive them by injection. Chromium helps your body use sugar properly. It is also needed for the breakdown of proteins and fats.</p><p>Lack of chromium may lead to nerve problems and may decrease the body's ability to use sugar properly.</p><p>There is not enough evidence to show that taking chromium supplements improves the way your body uses sugar (glucose tolerance).</p><p>Injectable chromium is given by or under the supervision of a health care professional. Other forms are available without a prescription.</p><h2>Importance of Diet</h2><p>For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.</p><p>Chromium is found in various foods, including brewer's yeast, calf liver, American cheese, and wheat germ.</p><p>The daily amount of chromium needed is defined in several different ways.</p><ul>For U.S.—
<li>Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).</li>
<li>Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).</li>
</ul><ul>For Canada—
<li>Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.</li>
</ul><p>Because a lack of chromium is rare, there is no RDA or RNI for it. Normal daily recommended intakes for chromium are generally defined as follows:</p><ul>
<li>Infants and children—
<ul>
<li>Birth to 3 years of age—10 to 80 micrograms (mcg) a day.</li>
<li>4 to 6 years of age—30 to 120 mcg a day.</li>
<li>7 to 10 years of age—50 to 200 mcg a day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adolescents and adults—50 to 200 mcg a day.</li>

However, taking large amounts of a dietary supplement while breast-feeding may be harmful to the mother and/or baby and should be avoided.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of dietary supplements in this class.
