Insulin is one of many hormones that help the body turn the food we eat into energy. This is done by using the glucose (sugar) in the blood as quick energy. Also, insulin helps us store energy that we can use later. When you have diabetes mellitus, your body cannot make enough insulin or does not use insulin properly. This causes you to have too much sugar in your blood. Like other types of insulin, insulin glargine is used to keep your blood sugar level close to normal. Lixisenatide is to be used when diet and exercise do not result in good blood sugar control.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Soliqua 100/33</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Soliqua® in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Soliqua® in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related hypoglycemia, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving Soliqua®.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Soliqua 100/33</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional may give you this medicine. You may also be taught how to give your medicine at home. This medicine is given as a shot under your skin.</p><p>Always double-check both the concentration (strength) of your insulin <i>and</i> your dose. <i>Concentration and dose are not the same</i>. The dose is how many units of insulin you will use. The concentration tells how many units of insulin are in each milliliter (mL), such as 100 units/mL (U-100), but this does not mean you will use 100 units at a time.</p><p>Each package of Soliqua® contains a patient information sheet. Read this sheet carefully and make sure you understand:</p><ul>
<li>How to prepare the medicine.</li>
<li>How to inject the medicine.</li>
<li>How to dispose of syringes, needles, and injection devices.</li>
</ul><p>It is best to use a different place on the body for each injection (eg, under the skin of your abdomen or stomach, thigh, or upper arm). Do <i>not</i> use the exact same spot for each injection. If you have questions about this, contact a member of your health care team.</p><p>Since this medicine lowers the blood glucose over 24 hours, it is best to use it at about the same time every day, usually within the hour before the first meal of the day.</p><p>The insulin solution should look clear and colorless. Do not use this medicine if it is cloudy or thickened.</p><p><i>Follow carefully the special meal plan your doctor gave you</i>. This is the most important part of controlling your condition, and is necessary if the medicine is to work properly. Also, exercise regularly and test for sugar in your blood or urine as directed.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

It is not safe for one pen to be used for more than one person. Sharing needles or pens can result in transmission of hepatitis viruses, HIV, or other bloodborne illnesses.</p><p><i>Your doctor will want to check your progress at regular visits</i>, especially during the first few weeks you take this medicine. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>It is very important to follow carefully any instructions from your health care team about:</p><ul>
<li>Alcohol—Drinking alcohol may cause severe low blood sugar. Discuss this with your health care team.</li>
<li>Other medicines—Do not take other medicines during the time you are taking insulin glargine and lixisenatide combination unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes nonprescription medicines such as aspirin, and medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems.</li>
<li>Counseling—Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Also, patients with diabetes may need special counseling about diabetes medicine dosing changes that might occur because of lifestyle changes, such as changes in exercise and diet. Furthermore, counseling on contraception and pregnancy may be needed because of the problems that can occur in patients with diabetes during pregnancy.</li>
<li>Travel—Keep a recent prescription and your medical history with you. Be prepared for an emergency as you would normally. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times.</li>

<li>Wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says that you have diabetes and a list of all of your medicines.</li>
<li>Keep an extra supply of Soliqua® and syringes with needles or injection devices on hand in case high blood sugar occurs.</li>
<li>Keep some kind of quick-acting sugar handy to treat low blood sugar.</li>
<li>Have a glucagon kit and a syringe and needle available in case severe low blood sugar occurs. Check and replace any expired kits regularly.</li>
</ul><p>Too much of this medicine can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Low blood sugar also can occur if you use Soliqua® with another antidiabetic medicine, changes in insulin regimen (eg, insulin strength, type of insulin, injection site), delay or miss a meal or snack, exercise more than usual, or drink alcohol. <i>Symptoms of low blood sugar must be treated before they lead to unconsciousness (passing out)</i>. Different people may feel different symptoms of low blood sugar.

Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Get to a doctor or a hospital right away if the symptoms do not improve. Someone should call for emergency help immediately if severe symptoms such as convulsions (seizures) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe and needle, and know how to use it. Members of your household also should know how to use it.</p><p>Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur if you do not take enough or skip a dose of your antidiabetic medicine or insulin, changes in insulin regimen, you overeat or do not follow your meal plan, have a fever or infection, or do not exercise as much as usual.</p><p><i>Symptoms of high blood sugar</i> include blurred vision, drowsiness, dry mouth, flushed, dry skin, fruit-like breath odor, increased urination, ketones in the urine, loss of appetite, stomachache, nausea or vomiting, tiredness, troubled breathing (rapid and deep), unconsciousness, and unusual thirst.</p><p>If symptoms of high blood sugar occur, check your blood sugar level and then call your doctor for instructions.</p><p>This medicine may cause a serious allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, shortness of breath, swelling of the face, tongue, and throat, trouble breathing, or chest pain after you receive the medicine.</p><p>Pancreatitis may occur while you are using this medicine. Tell your doctor right away if you have sudden and severe stomach pain, chills, constipation, nausea, vomiting, fever, or lightheadedness.</p><p>This medicine may cause low levels of potassium in your blood. <i>Do not use medicines, supplements, or salt substitutes that contain potassium unless you have discussed this with your doctor</i>.</p><p>Using this medicine together with other diabetes medicine (eg, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, Actos®, Actoplus Met®, Avandia®) may cause serious heart problem or edema (fluid retention).
