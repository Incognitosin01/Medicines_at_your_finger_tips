Poisoning with these chemicals or medicines causes your muscles, including the muscles that help you breathe, to become weak. Pralidoxime is used to help you get back strength in your muscles.</p><p>Pralidoxime is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor or trained military personnel.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using pralidoxime</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For pralidoxime, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to pralidoxime or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pralidoxime injection in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pralidoxime injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving pralidoxime injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of pralidoxime. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Kidney disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Myasthenia gravis (severe muscle weakness)—Use with caution. May make this condition worse.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of pralidoxime</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you pralidoxime in a hospital or clinic. You may also be taught how to give your medicine at home. Pralidoxime is preferably given through a needle placed in one of your veins. It may also be given as a shot under your skin or into a muscle.</p><p>Pralidoxime is available in two forms: a vial and an autoinjector.</p><p>For patients using the pralidoxime <i>autoinjector</i> (automatic injection device):</p><ul>
<li>You will be trained to use the pralidoxime autoinjector by a medic or other trained military personnel. You will also be told the conditions under which it should be used.</li>
<li>The autoinjector also comes with patient directions. Read them carefully before you actually need to use pralidoxime. Then, when an emergency arises, you will know how to inject the pralidoxime.</li>
<li>It is important that you do not remove the safety cap on the autoinjector until you are ready to use it. This prevents spillage of the medicine from the device during storage and handling.</li>
<li>To use the pralidoxime autoinjector:
<ul>
<li>Remove the gray safety cap.</li>
<li>Place the black tip of the device on the thigh, with the injector pointed straight at the thigh.</li>
<li>Press hard into the thigh until the autoinjector functions. Hold in place for several seconds. Remove the autoinjector and dispose of it as directed.</li>
<li>Massage the injected area for 10 seconds.</li>

</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of pralidoxime will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of pralidoxime. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
