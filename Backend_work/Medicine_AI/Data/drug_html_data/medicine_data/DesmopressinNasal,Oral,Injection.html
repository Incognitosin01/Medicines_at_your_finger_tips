<html><head></head><body><h1>Desmopressin</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> desmopressin (des-moe-PRES-in)</p><p>Desmopressin acetate can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest or death. Desmopressin acetate is contraindicated in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as patients with excessive fluid intake, illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances (eg, gastroenteritis, salt-wasting nephropathies, or systemic infection), and in those using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids. Ensure serum sodium concentrations are normal before starting or resuming desmopressin acetate. Measure serum sodium within 7 days and approximately 1 month after initiating therapy or increasing the dose, and periodically during treatment. More frequently monitor serum sodium in patients 65 years of age and older and in patients at increased risk of hyponatremia. If hyponatremia occurs, desmopressin acetate may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

This is a condition that causes the body to lose too much fluid and become dehydrated. It is also used to control frequent urination and increased thirst caused by certain types of brain injury or brain surgery. The <i>Stimate®</i> nasal spray is used to treat bleeding in patients with hemophilia A or von Willebrand disease (Type I).</p><p><i>Noctiva™</i> nasal spray is used to treat nocturnal polyuria in adults who awaken two or more times to urinate at night. Nocturnal polyuria is a condition where your body makes too much urine at night. Your doctor will need to measure your urine and the times that you urinate for 24 hours to determine if you have nocturnal polyuria.</p><p>Desmopressin is similar to a hormone that is produced in the body. It acts on the kidneys to reduce the flow of urine. For bleeding, desmopressin increases the blood levels of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor. This results in less bleeding for patients who have low levels of these agents.</p><p>Desmopressin is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using desmopressin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For desmopressin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to desmopressin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of desmopressin nasal spray to treat <i>central diabetes insipidus</i> in <i>children 3 months of age and older for desmopressin acetate</i> or in <i>children 4 years of age and older for DDAVP®</i>. Safety and efficacy have been established.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>Stimate®</i> to treat hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease in children 11 months of age and older. However, use is not recommended in children younger than 11 months of age.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Noctiva™</i> in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of desmopressin nasal spray in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving desmopressin.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>Noctiva™</i> in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood), which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving <i>Noctiva™</i>.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking desmopressin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using desmopressin with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
