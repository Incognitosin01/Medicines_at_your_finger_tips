Sodium sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide with antibacterial activity while sulfur acts as a keratolytic agent. Chemically, sodium sulfacetamide is N-[(4-aminophenyl) sulfonyl]-acetamide, monosodium salt, monohydrate. The structural formula is:</p><p></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</span> The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods-Fildes theory, which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth. While absorption through intact skin has not been determined, sodium sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine, largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours.<br/>
<br/>
The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown, but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of <span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes</span> and the formation of free fatty acids.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</span> Prascion RA Cream With Sunscreens is indicated in the topical control of acne vulgaris, acne rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS:</span> Prascion RA Cream With Sunscreens is contraindicated for use by patients having known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, sulfur or any other component of this preparation. This drug is not to be used by patients with kidney disease.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span> Although rare, sensitivity to sodium sulfacetamide may occur. Therefore, caution and careful supervision should be observed when prescribing this drug for patients who may be prone to hypersensitivity to topical sulfacetamides. Systemic toxic reactions such as agranulocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, purpura hemorrhagica, drug fever, jaundice, and contact dermatitis indicated hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Particular caution should be employed if areas of denuded or abraded skin are involved.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS: General -</span> If irritation develops, use of the product should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. For external use only. Keep away from eyes. Patients should be carefully observed for possible local irritation or sensitization during long-term therapy. The object of this<br/>
therapy is to achieve desquamation without irritation, but sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur can cause reddening and scaling of epidermis. These side effects are not unusual in the treatment of acne vulgaris, but patients should be cautioned about the possibility.<br/>
