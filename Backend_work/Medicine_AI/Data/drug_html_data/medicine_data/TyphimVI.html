Untreated typhoid infection may lead to kidney failure, or intestinal bleeding, which can be fatal. If the infection spreads to your gallbladder, you could become a chronic carrier of the bacteria that causes typhoid. A carrier may have no symptoms but is capable of spreading the infection to others.</p><p>Typhoid is spread through contact with the stool (bowel movements) of a person infected with the bacteria. This usually occurs by eating food or drinking water that has become contaminated with feces from an infected person. Once in the digestive tract, typhoid infection can spread to the blood and other parts of the body.</p><p>Typhoid can cause high fever, muscle aches, severe headache, weakness, confusion or agitation, loss of appetite, stomach pain, diarrhea or constipation, and rose-colored spots on the skin.</p><p>Typhoid vaccine is used to help prevent this disease in adults and children who are at least 2 years old. Although not part of a routine immunization schedule in the U.S., typhoid vaccine is recommended for:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>people who travel to area where typhoid fever is common (non-industrialized parts of the world, especially Asia, Africa, and Central or South America);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people who live with someone who is a typhoid carrier; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>laboratory workers who may come into contact with Salmonella typhi in a work setting.</p>

<li>
<p>fever with any type of infection or illness;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a bleeding or blood clotting disorder (such as hemophilia);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a weak immune system caused by disease such as HIV/AIDS or cancer; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a weak immune system caused by receiving certain medicines such as steroids, chemotherapy or radiation.</p>

Your doctor will decide whether you should receive this vaccine.</p><p>It is not known whether typhoid vaccine passes into breast milk, or if it could harm a nursing baby.

<li>
<p>people who travel to countries where typhoid fever is common;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people who will have long-term exposure to food or water that may be contaminated with typhoid;</p>

You will receive this injection in a doctor's office or other clinic setting.</p><p>The typhoid vaccine is given as a single injection. A booster dose is then recommended every 2 years during possible exposure to typhoid. Your individual booster schedule may be different from these guidelines. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>Wash your hands often to help prevent typhoid when you are in an area where contamination is possible.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Be sure to receive a booster dose of this vaccine every 2 years during continued exposure to typhoid. If you do not receive the booster every 2 years, you may not be fully protected against the disease.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of this vaccine is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid before or after getting typhoid vaccine?</h2><p>In addition to receiving typhoid vaccine, take precautions while traveling to further prevent coming into contact with bacteria that cause typhoid fever:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Avoid eating leafy vegetables such as spinach or lettuce, which are harder to wash properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid eating raw fruits or vegetables that cannot be peeled, or that have been peeled by another person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid drinks that contain ice, or frozen treats and flavored ices that may have been made with contaminated water.</p>

When you receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shots caused any side effects.</p><p>Becoming infected with typhoid is much more dangerous to your health than receiving the vaccine to protect against it.
