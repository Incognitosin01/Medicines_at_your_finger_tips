Atropine reverses the muscarinic effects of cholinergic poisoning due to agents with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor activity by acting as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. The primary goal in cholinergic poisonings is reversal of bronchorrhea and bronchoconstriction. Atropine has no effect on the nicotinic receptors responsible for muscle weakness, fasciculations, and paralysis.</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Rapid and well absorbed from all dosage forms </p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Widely distributes throughout the body; crosses the blood-brain barrier</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Hepatic via enzymatic hydrolysis</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (13% to 50% as unchanged drug and metabolites)</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>Inhibition of salivation: IM: Within 30 minutes; maximum effect: 30 to 60 minutes (Mirakhur 1980; Volz-Zang 1995)</p><p>Increased heart rate:</p><p>IM: Within 15 to 30 minutes (Kentala 1990; Volz-Zang 1995); maximum effect: 45 to 60 minutes (Mirakhur 1980; Volz-Zang 1995)</p><p>IV: Immediate; maximum effect: 0.7 to 4 minutes (Lonnerholm 1975; Santini 1999)</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>IM: 30 minutes; IM autoinjector: 3 minutes</p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>Inhibition of salivation: IM: ≤4 hours </p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Children &lt;2 years: 6.9 ± 3 hours; Children &gt;2 years: 2.5 ± 1.2 hours; Adults: 3 ± 0.9 hours; Elderly 65 to 75 years of age: 10 ± 7.3 hours</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>14% to 44%</p><h2>Special Populations: Elderly</h2><p>Elimination half-life is more than doubled.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Bradycardia during neuromuscular blockade reversal:</b> Adjuvant use during neuromuscular blockade reversal with anticholinesterases (eg, edrophonium, neostigmine) to manage bradycardia.</p><p><b>Bradycardia, symptomatic:</b> Treatment of symptomatic sinus bradycardia.</p><p><b>Inhibition of salivation and secretions (preanesthesia):</b> Preoperative/preanesthetic medication to inhibit salivation and secretions.</p><p><b>Muscarine-containing mushroom poisoning:</b> Treatment of symptoms from muscarine-containing mushroom poisoning.</p><p><b>Organophosphate or carbamate insecticide or nerve agent poisoning:</b> Antidote for anticholinesterase poisoning (carbamate insecticides, nerve agents, organophosphate insecticides).</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Stress echocardiography (adjunct chronotropic agent)</h3><p>Data from a number of clinical studies evaluating the use of atropine to increase heart rate as an adjunctive agent during dobutamine stress echocardiography support the use of atropine when at least 85% of the age-predicted maximal target heart rate is not achieved with dobutamine alone <sup>[Bholasingh 2003]</sup>, <sup>[Fioretti 1994]</sup>, <sup>[McNeill 1992]</sup>, <sup>[Picano 1994]</sup>.</p><p>Based on the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology imaging guidelines for single-photon emission CT nuclear cardiology procedures, atropine may be administered as an adjunctive agent to increase heart rate in patients who do not achieve target heart rate with dobutamine alone <sup>[ASNC [Henzlova 2016]]</sup>.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>There are no contraindications listed in the manufacturer’s labeling.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note:</b> IV doses &lt;0.5 mg have been associated with paradoxical bradycardia (Boudet 1991; Lonnerholm 1975).

Avoid use if possible in patients with obstructive uropathy or in other conditions resulting in urinary retention</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Heart transplant recipients: Atropine will likely be ineffective in treatment of bradycardia due to lack of vagal innervation of the transplanted heart. Cholinergic reinnervation may occur over time (years), so atropine may be used cautiously; however, some may experience paradoxical slowing of the heart rate and high-degree AV block upon administration (ACLS 2010; Bernheim 2004).</p><p>• Pediatric: Children may be more sensitive to the anticholinergic effects of atropine. Use with caution in children with spastic paralysis.</p><p><i><b>Dosage form specific issues:</b></i></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol and/or sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggest that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol and/or benzyl alcohol derivative with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions: </i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Anticholinesterase poisoning: Atropine reverses the muscarinic but not the nicotinic effects associated with anticholinesterase toxicity. Clinical symptoms consistent with highly-suspected organophosphate or carbamate insecticides or nerve agent poisoning should be treated with antidote immediately; administration should not be delayed for confirmatory laboratory tests. Signs of atropinization include flushing, mydriasis, tachycardia, and dryness of the mouth or nose. Monitor effects closely when administering subsequent injections as necessary. The presence of these effects is not indicative of the success of therapy; inappropriate use of mydriasis as an indicator of successful treatment has resulted in atropine toxicity. Reversal of bronchial secretions is the preferred indicator of success. Adjunct treatment with a cholinesterase reactivator (eg, pralidoxime) may be required in patients with toxicity secondary to organophosphorus insecticides or nerve agents. Treatment should always include proper evacuation and decontamination procedures; medical personnel should protect themselves from inadvertent contamination. Antidotal administration is intended only for initial management; definitive and more extensive medical care is required following administration. Individuals should not rely solely on antidote for treatment, as other supportive measures (eg, artificial respiration) may still be required.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, mental status; intravenous administration requires a cardiac monitor</p><p><i>Organophosphate or carbamate insecticide or nerve agent poisoning:</i> Heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory status, oxygenation secretions. Maintain atropinization with repeated dosing as indicated by clinical status. Crackles in lung bases, or continuation of cholinergic signs, may be signs of inadequate dosing. Pulmonary improvement may not parallel other signs of atropinization. Monitor for signs and symptoms of atropine toxicity (eg, fever, muscle fasciculations, delirium); if toxicity occurs, discontinue atropine and monitor closely.</p><p>Consult individual institutional policies and procedures.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Atropine has been found to cross the human placenta (Kanto 1981). In general, medications used as antidotes should take into consideration the health and prognosis of the mother; antidotes should be administered to pregnant women if there is a clear indication for use and should not be withheld because of fears of teratogenicity (Bailey 2003). Medications used for the treatment of cardiac arrest in pregnancy are the same as in the non-pregnant woman. Doses and indications should follow current Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support guidelines. Appropriate medications should not be withheld due to concerns of fetal teratogenicity (Jeejeebhoy [AHA] 2015).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat some poisonings.</p><p>• In surgery, it is used to lower secretions such as saliva.</p><p>• It is used to treat muscle spasms of the GI (gastrointestinal) tract, gallbladder system, or urinary system.</p><p>• It is used when the heart is not beating.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
