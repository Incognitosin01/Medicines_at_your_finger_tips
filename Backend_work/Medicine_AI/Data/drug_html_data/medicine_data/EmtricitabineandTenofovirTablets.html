Table 2 provides dosage interval adjustment for patients with renal impairment. No dosage adjustment is necessary for HIV-1 infected patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50–80 mL/min). The safety and effectiveness of the dosing interval adjustment recommendations in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min) have not been clinically evaluated; therefore, clinical response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span><br/>

• Tablet: 200 mg of emtricitabine and 300 mg of tenofovir DF (equivalent to 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil): white, capsule shaped, film coated, debossed with “L-24” on one side and with “701” on the other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for HIV-1 PrEP is contraindicated in individuals with unknown or positive HIV-1 status [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Individuals with HBV Infection</h3><p class="First">All individuals should be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before or when initiating emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].</span><br/>
Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (e.g., liver decompensation and liver failure) have been reported in HBV-infected individuals who have discontinued emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets. Individuals infected with HBV who discontinue emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in individuals with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure. HBV-uninfected individuals should be offered vaccination.</p><h3>Comprehensive Management to Reduce the Risk of Sexually Transmitted Infections, Including HIV-1, and Development of HIV-1 Resistance When emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets Is Used for HIV-1 PrEP</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Use emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for HIV-1 PrEP to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy that includes other prevention measures, including adherence to daily administration and safer sex practices, including condoms, to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The time from initiation of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for HIV-1 PrEP to maximal protection against HIV-1 infection is unknown.</span><br/>
<span class="following_xmChange">Risk for HIV-1 acquisition includes behavioral, biological, or epidemiologic factors including but not limited to condomless sex, past or current STIs, self-identified HIV risk, having sexual partners of unknown HIV-1 viremic status, or sexual activity in a high prevalence area or network.<br/>
Counsel individuals on the use of other prevention measures (e.g., consistent and correct condom use, knowledge of partner(s)’ HIV-1 status, including viral suppression status, regular testing for STIs that can facilitate HIV-1 transmission). Inform uninfected individuals about and support their efforts in reducing sexual risk behavior</span>.<br/>
<span class="following_xmChange">Use emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 only in individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative. HIV-1 resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection who are taking only emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets, because emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets alone does not constitute a complete regimen for HIV-1 treatment [see Microbiology (12.4)]; therefore, care should be taken to minimize the risk of initiating or continuing emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets before confirming the individual is HIV-1 negative</span>.<br/>
<span class="following_xmChange">• Some HIV-1 tests only detect anti-HIV antibodies and may not identify HIV-1 during the acute stage of infection. Prior to initiating emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for HIV-1 PrEP, ask seronegative individuals about recent (in past month) potential exposure events (e.g., condomless sex or condom breaking during sex with a partner of unknown HIV-1 status or unknown viremic status, or a recent STI), and evaluate for current or recent signs or symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection (e.g., fever, fatigue, myalgia, skin rash).</span><br/>
<span class="following_xmChange">• If recent (&lt;1 month) exposures to HIV-1 are suspected or clinical symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection are present, use a test approved or cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or primary HIV-1 infection.<br/>
While using emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for HIV-1 PrEP, HIV-1 testing should be repeated at least every 3 months, and upon diagnosis of any other STIs</span>.<br/>
<span class="following_xmChange">• If an HIV-1 test indicates possible HIV-1 infection, or if symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection develop following a potential exposure event, convert the HIV-1 PrEP regimen to an HIV treatment regimen until negative infection status is confirmed using a test approved or cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or primary HIV-1 infection.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Counsel HIV-1 uninfected individuals to strictly adhere to the once daily emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets dosing schedule. The effectiveness of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated with adherence, as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in clinical trials of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for HIV-1 PrEP. Some individuals, such as adolescents, may benefit from more frequent visits and counseling to support adherence [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Microbiology (12.4), and Clinical Studies (14.3 and 14.4)].</span></p><h3>New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of TDF, a component of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span><br/>
Prior to initiation and during use of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all individuals. In individuals with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus.Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span> Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.</p><p>Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures, and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in individuals at risk of renal dysfunction.</p><p><span class="Italics">Treatment of HIV-1 Infection</span></p><p>Dosing interval adjustment of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with estimated creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].</span> No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity. emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min or patients requiring hemodialysis.</p><p><span class="Italics">HIV-1 PrEP</span></p><p>Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for HIV-1 PrEP is not recommended in uninfected individuals with estimated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min. If a decrease in estimated creatinine clearance is observed while using emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for HIV-1 PrEP, evaluate potential causes and re-assess potential risks and benefits of continued use <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].</span></p><h3>Immune Reconstitution Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, HIV-1 infected patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment</span>.</p><h3>Bone Loss and Mineralization Defects</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Bone Mineral Density:</span></p><p>In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults and in a clinical trial of HIV-1 uninfected individuals, TDF (a component of Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets) was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving TDF.</p><p>Clinical trials evaluating TDF in pediatric and adolescent subjects were conducted. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in pediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected subjects aged 2 years to less than 18 years, bone effects were similar to those observed in adult subjects and suggest increased bone turnover. Total body BMD gain was less in the TDF-treated HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects as compared to the control groups. Similar trends were observed in adolescent subjects aged 12 years to less than 18 years treated for chronic hepatitis B. In all pediatric trials, skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected.</p><p>The effects of TDF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for adult and pediatric patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial. If bone abnormalities are suspected, appropriate consultation should be obtained.</p><p><span class="Italics">Mineralization Defects</span><br/>
Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with TDF use <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> Arthralgia and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving TDF-containing products <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><h3>Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis</h3><p class="First">Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including FTC and TDF, components of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should be suspended in any individual who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).</p><h3>Risk of Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)].</span><br/>
See Table 7 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets; review concomitant medications during therapy with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets; and monitor for adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling:<br/>

• Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience in HIV-1 Infected Subjects</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects</span></p><p>In Study 934, 511 antiretroviral-naïve subjects received efavirenz (EFV) administered in combination with either FTC+TDF (N=257) or zidovudine (AZT)/lamivudine (3TC) (N=254) for 144 weeks. The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, all grades) included diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. Table 3 provides the treatment-emergent adverse reactions (Grades 2–4) occurring in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects treated in any treatment group.</p><p>Skin discoloration, manifested by hyperpigmentation, occurred in 3% of subjects taking FTC+TDF, and was generally mild and asymptomatic.

Emtricitabine:</span> In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anemia and hyperpigmentation were observed in 7% and 32%, respectively, of pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) who received treatment with FTC in the larger of two open-label, uncontrolled pediatric trials (N=116).<br/>
<span class="Italics">Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate:</span> In pediatric clinical trials (Studies 352 and 321) conducted in 184 HIV1 infected subjects 2 to less than 18 years of age, the adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with TDF were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of TDF in adults.<br/>
In Study 352 (2 to less than 12 years of age), 89 pediatric subjects received TDF for a median exposure of 104 weeks. Of these, 4 subjects discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy. Three of these 4 subjects presented with hypophosphatemia and had decreases in total body or spine BMD Z-score <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].</span> Total body BMD gain at Week 48 was less in the TDF group compared to the stavudine (d4T) or zidovudine (AZT) treatment groups. The mean rate of BMD gain in lumbar spine was similar between treatment groups. One TDF-treated subject and none of the d4T-or AZT-treated subjects experienced significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at Week 48. Changes from baseline in BMD Z-scores were −0.012 for lumbar spine and −0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects who were treated with TDF for 96 weeks.</p><p>In Study 321 (12 to less than 18 years of age), the mean rate of BMD gain at Week 48 was less in the TDF compared to the placebo treatment group. Six TDF-treated subjects and one placebo-treated subject had significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at Week 48. Changes from baseline BMD Z-scores were −0.341 for lumbar spine and −0.458 for total body in the 28 subjects who were treated with TDF for 96 weeks.</p><p>In both trials, skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trial Experience in Uninfected Subjects Taking emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for HIV-1 PrEP</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects</span><br/>
The safety profile of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for HIV-1 PrEP was comparable to that observed in clinical trials of HIV-infected subjects based on two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (iPrEx, Partners PrEP) in which 2,830 HIV-1 uninfected adults received emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets once daily for HIV-1 PrEP. Subjects were followed for a median of 71 weeks and 87 weeks, respectively. Table 5 provides a list of selected adverse events that occurred in 2% or more of subjects in any treatment group in the iPrEx trial, with an incidence greater than placebo.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 5 Selected Adverse Events (All Grades) Reported in ≥2% in Any Treatment Group in the iPrEx Trial and Greater than Placebo</span></p><p> </p><p>In the Partners PrEP trial, the frequency of adverse events in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets treatment group was generally either less than or the same as in the placebo group.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Laboratory Abnormalities:</span> Table 6 provides a list of Grade 2-4 laboratory abnormalities observed in the iPrEx and Partners PrEP trials. Six subjects in the TDF-containing arms of the Partners PrEP trial discontinued from the trial due to an increase in serum creatinine compared with no discontinuations in the placebo group. One subject in the Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets arm of the iPrEx trial discontinued from the trial due to an increase in serum creatinine and another subject discontinued due to low serum phosphorus. Grades 2−3 proteinuria (2-4+) and/or glycosuria (3+) occurred in less than 1% of subjects treated with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets in the iPrEx trial and Partners PrEP trial.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 6  Laboratory Abnormalities (Highest Toxicity Grade Reported for Each Subject) in the iPrEx Trial and Partners PrEP Trial</span></p><p>a. Grading is per DAIDS criteria.</p><p><span class="Italics">Changes in Bone Mineral Density:</span> In clinical trials of HIV-1 uninfected individuals, decreases in BMD were observed. In the iPrEx trial, a substudy of 503 subjects found mean changes from baseline in BMD ranging from –0.4% to –1.0% across total hip, spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group compared with the placebo group, which returned toward baseline after discontinuation of treatment. Thirteen percent of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets -treated subjects versus 6% of placebo-treated subjects lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine during treatment. Bone fractures were reported in 1.7% of the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group compared with 1.4% in the placebo group. No correlation between BMD and fractures was noted <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3)].</span> The Partners PrEP trial found similar fracture rates between the treatment and placebo groups (0.8% and 0.6%, respectively); no BMD evaluations were performed in this trial <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.4)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Clinical Trials in Adolescent Subjects</span><br/>
In a single-arm, open-label clinical trial (ATN113), in which 67 HIV-1 uninfected adolescent (15 to 18 years of age) men who have sex with men received emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets once daily for HIV-1 PrEP, the safety profile of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets was similar to that observed in adults. Median duration to exposure of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets was 47 weeks <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><p>In the ATN113 trial, median BMD increased from baseline to Week 48, +2.58% for lumbar spine and +0.72% for total body. One subject had significant (greater than or equal to 4%) total body BMD loss at Week 24. Median changes from baseline BMD Z-scores were 0.0 for lumbar spine and −0.2 for total body at Week 48. Three subjects showed a worsening (change from &gt; −2 to ≤ −2) from baseline in their lumbar spine or total body BMD Z-scores at Week 24 or 48.

emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should only be administered to HIV-1 infected pediatric patients with body weight greater than or equal to 17 kg and who are able to swallow a tablet. Because it is a fixed-dose combination tablet, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets cannot be adjusted for patients of lower weight <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets is not approved for use in pediatric patients weighing less than 17 kg.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">HIV-1 PrEP</span></span><br/>
The safety and effectiveness of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for HIV-1 PrEP in at-risk adolescents weighing at least 35 kg is supported by data from adequate and well-controlled studies of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for HIV-1 PrEP in adults with additional data from safety and pharmacokinetic studies in previously conducted trials with the individual drug products, FTC and TDF, in HIV-1 infected adults and pediatric subjects <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 and 12.4), and Clinical Studies (14.3 and 14.4)].</span></p><p>Safety, adherence, and resistance were evaluated in a single-arm, open-label clinical trial (ATN113) in which 67 HIV-1 uninfected at-risk adolescent men who have sex with men received emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets once daily for HIV-1 PrEP. The mean age of subjects was 17 years (range 15 to 18 years); 46% were Hispanic, 52% Black, and 37% White.

<span class="Italics">Resistance<br/>
Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate:</span> HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to the combination of FTC and tenofovir have been selected in cell culture. Genotypic analysis of these isolates identified the M184V/I and/or K65R amino acid substitutions in the viral RT. In addition, a K70E substitution in the HIV-1 RT has been selected by tenofovir and results in reduced susceptibility to tenofovir.<br/>
In Study 934, a clinical trial of treatment-naïve subjects [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], resistance analysis was performed on HIV-1 isolates from all confirmed virologic failure subjects with greater than 400 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA at Week 144 or early discontinuation. Development of efavirenz resistance-associated substitutions occurred most frequently and was similar between the treatment arms. The M184V amino acid substitution, associated with resistance to FTC and lamivudine, was observed in 2/19 analyzed subject isolates in the FTC+TDF group and in 10/29 analyzed subject isolates in the zidovudine/lamivudine group. Through 144 weeks of Study 934, no subjects have developed a detectable K65R or K70E substitution in their HIV-1 as analyzed through standard genotypic analysis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Emtricitabine:</span> FTC-resistant isolates of HIV-1 have been selected in cell culture and in vivo.

<span class="Italics">Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate:</span> HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir have been selected in cell culture.

Ten subjects were observed to be HIV-1 infected at time of enrollment. The M184V/I substitutions associated with resistance to FTC were observed in 3 of the 10 subjects (2 of 2 in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group and 1 of 8 in the placebo group). One of the two subjects in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group harbored wild type virus at enrollment and developed the M184V substitution 4 weeks after enrollment. The other subject had indeterminate resistance at enrollment but was found to have the M184I substitution 4 weeks after enrollment.</p><p>Partners PrEP Trial: In the Partners PrEP trial, a clinical trial of HIV-1 seronegative adult subjects [see Clinical Studies (14.4)], no variants expressing amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to FTC or TDF were detected at the time of seroconversion among 12 subjects in the Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group, 15 subjects in the TDF group, and 51 subjects in the placebo group. Fourteen subjects were observed to be HIV-1 infected at the time of enrollment (3 in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group, 5 in the TDF group, and 6 in the placebo group). One of the three subjects in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group who was infected with wild type virus at enrollment selected an M184V expressing virus by Week 12. Two of the five subjects in the TDF group had tenofovir-resistant viruses at the time of seroconversion; one subject infected with wild type virus at enrollment developed a K65R substitution by Week 16, while the second subject had virus expressing the combination of D67N and K70R substitutions upon seroconversion at Week 60, although baseline virus was not genotyped and it is unclear if the resistance emerged or was transmitted. Following enrollment, 4 subjects (2 in the TDF group, 1 in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group, and 1 in the placebo group) had virus expressing K103N or V106A substitutions, which confer high-level resistance to NNRTIs but have not been associated with FTC or TDF and may have been present in the infecting virus.</p><p>ATN113 Trial: In ATN113, a clinical trial of HIV-1 seronegative adolescent subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)], no amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to FTC or TDF were detected at the time of seroconversion from any of the 3 subjects who became infected with HIV-1 during the trial. All 3 subjects who seroconverted were nonadherent to the recommended Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets dosage.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cross Resistance<br/>
Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate:</span> Cross-resistance among certain NRTIs has been recognized. The M184V/I and/or K65R substitutions selected in cell culture by the combination of FTC and tenofovir are also observed in some HIV-1 isolates from subjects failing treatment with tenofovir in combination with either FTC or lamivudine, and either abacavir or didanosine. Therefore, cross-resistance among these drugs may occur in patients whose virus harbors either or both of these amino acid substitutions.</p><p><span class="Italics">Emtricitabine:</span> FTC-resistant isolates (M184V/I) were cross-resistant to lamivudine but retained susceptibility in cell culture to the NRTIs didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zidovudine, and to NNRTIs (delavirdine, efavirenz, and nevirapine). HIV-1 isolates containing the K65R substitution, selected in vivo by abacavir, didanosine, and tenofovir, demonstrated reduced susceptibility to inhibition by FTC. Viruses harboring substitutions conferring reduced susceptibility to stavudine and zidovudine (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219Q/E), or didanosine (L74V) remained sensitive to FTC. HIV-1 containing the K103N substitution associated with resistance to NNRTIs was susceptible to FTC.</p><p><span class="Italics">Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate:</span> The K65R and K70E substitutions selected by tenofovir are also selected in some HIV-1 infected patients treated with abacavir or didanosine. HIV-1 isolates with the K65R and K70E substitutions also showed reduced susceptibility to FTC and lamivudine. Therefore, cross-resistance among these NRTIs may occur in patients whose virus harbors the K65R or K70E substitutions. HIV-1 isolates from subjects (N=20) whose HIV-1 expressed a mean of 3 zidovudineassociated RT amino acid substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N) showed a 3.1-fold decrease in the susceptibility to tenofovir. Subjects whose virus expressed an L74V substitution without zidovudine resistance-associated substitutions (N=8) had reduced response to TDF. Limited data are available for patients whose virus expressed a Y115F substitution (N=3), Q151M substitution (N=2), or T69 insertion (N=4), all of whom had a reduced response.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis &amp; Mutagenesis &amp; Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Emtricitabine:</span> In long-term oral carcinogenicity studies of FTC, no drug-related increases in tumor incidence were found in mice at doses up to 750 mg/kg/day (26 times the human systemic exposure at the therapeutic dose of 200 mg/day) or in rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day (31 times the human systemic exposure at the therapeutic dose).<br/>
FTC was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial test (Ames test), or the mouse lymphoma or mouse micronucleus assays.<br/>
FTC did not affect fertility in male rats at approximately 140-fold or in male and female mice at approximately 60-fold higher exposures (AUC) than in humans given the recommended 200 mg daily dose. Fertility was normal in the offspring of mice exposed daily from before birth (in utero) through sexual maturity at daily exposures (AUC) of approximately 60-fold higher than human exposures at the recommended 200 mg daily dose.</p><p><span class="Italics">Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate:</span> Long-term oral carcinogenicity studies of TDF in mice and rats were carried out at exposures up to approximately 16 times (mice) and 5 times (rats) those observed in humans at the therapeutic dose for HIV-1 infection. At the high dose in female mice, liver adenomas were increased at exposures 16 times that in humans. In rats, the study was negative for carcinogenic findings at exposures up to 5 times that observed in humans at the therapeutic dose.</p><p>TDF was mutagenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and negative in an in vitro bacterial mutagenicity test (Ames test). In an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, TDF was negative when administered to male mice.</p><p>There were no effects on fertility, mating performance or early embryonic development when TDF was administered to male rats at a dose equivalent to 10 times the human dose based on body surface area comparisons for 28 days prior to mating and to female rats for 15 days prior to mating through day 7 of gestation. There was, however, an alteration of the estrous cycle in female rats.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Tenofovir and TDF administered in toxicology studies to rats, dogs and monkeys at exposures (based on AUCs) greater than or equal to 6-fold those observed in humans caused bone toxicity. In monkeys the bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia. Osteomalacia observed in monkeys appeared to be reversible upon dose reduction or discontinuation of tenofovir. In rats and dogs, the bone toxicity manifested as reduced bone mineral density. The mechanism(s) underlying bone toxicity is unknown.</p><p>Evidence of renal toxicity was noted in four animal species. Increases in serum creatinine, BUN, glycosuria, proteinuria, phosphaturia, and/or calciuria and decreases in serum phosphate were observed to varying degrees in these animals. These toxicities were noted at exposures (based on AUCs) 2–20 times higher than those observed in humans. The relationship of the renal abnormalities, particularly the phosphaturia, to the bone toxicity is not known.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Overview of Clinical Trials</h3><p class="First">The efficacy and safety of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets have been evaluated in the studies summarized in Table 13.<br/>

From Weeks 96 to 144 of the trial, subjects received emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets with EFV in place of FTC+TDF with EFV. Subjects had a mean age of 38 years (range 18–80); 86% were male, 59% were Caucasian, and 23% were Black. The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 245 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> (range 2–1,191) and median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.01 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL (range 3.56–6.54).

The difference in the proportion of subjects who achieved and maintained HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/mL through 48 weeks is largely due to the higher number of discontinuations due to adverse events and other reasons in the AZT/3TC group in this open-label trial. In addition, 80% and 70% of subjects in the FTC+TDF group and the AZT/3TC group, respectively, achieved and maintained HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL through Week 48 (64% and 56% through Week 144). The mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count was 190 cells/mm3 in the FTC+TDF group and 158 cells/mm3 in the AZT/3TC group at Week 48 (312 and 271 cells/mm3 at Week 144).</p><p>Through 48 weeks, 7 subjects in the FTC+TDF group and 5 subjects in the AZT/3TC group experienced a new CDC Class C event (10 and 6 subjects through 144 weeks).</p><h3>Clinical Trial Results for HIV-1 PrEP: iPrEx</h3><p class="First">The iPrEx trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multinational study evaluating emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets in 2,499 HIV-seronegative men or transgender women who have sex with men and with evidence of high-risk behavior for HIV-1 infection. Evidence of high-risk behavior included any one of the following reported to have occurred up to six months prior to study screening: no condom use during anal intercourse with an HIV-1 positive partner or a partner of unknown HIV status; anal intercourse with more than 3 sex partners; exchange of money, gifts, shelter, or drugs for anal sex; sex with male partner and diagnosis of sexually transmitted infection; no consistent use of condoms with sex partner known to be HIV-1 positive.<br/>
All subjects received monthly HIV-1 testing, risk-reduction counseling, condoms, and management of sexually transmitted infections. Of the 2,499 enrolled subjects, 1,251 received emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and 1,248 received placebo. The mean age of subjects was 27 years; 5% were Asian, 9% Black, 18% White, and 72% Hispanic/Latino.<br/>
Subjects were followed for 4,237 person-years. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of documented HIV seroconversion. At the end of treatment, emergent HIV-1 seroconversion was observed in 131 subjects, of which 48 occurred in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group and 83 occurred in the placebo group, indicating a 42% (95% CI: 18–60%) reduction in risk. Risk reduction was found to be higher (53%; 95% CI: 34–72%) among subjects who reported previous unprotected anal intercourse (URAI) at screening (732 and 753 subjects reported URAI within the last 12 weeks at screening in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and placebo groups, respectively). In a post-hoc case control study of plasma and intracellular drug levels in about 10% of study subjects, risk reduction appeared to be greatest in subjects with detectable intracellular tenofovir diphosphate concentrations. Efficacy was therefore strongly correlated with adherence.</p><h3>Clinical Trial Results for HIV-1 PrEP: Partners PrEP</h3><p class="First">The Partners PrEP trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-arm trial conducted in 4,758 HIV-1 serodiscordant heterosexual couples in Kenya and Uganda to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TDF (N=1,589) and FTC/TDF (N=1,583) versus (parallel comparison) placebo (N=1,586) in preventing HIV-1 acquisition by the uninfected partner.<br/>
All uninfected partner subjects received monthly HIV-1 testing, evaluation of adherence, assessment of sexual behavior, and safety evaluations. Women were also tested monthly for pregnancy. Women who became pregnant during the trial had study drug interrupted for the duration of the pregnancy and while breastfeeding. The uninfected partner subjects were predominantly male (61–64% across study drug groups) and had a mean age of 33–34 years.<br/>
Following 7,827 person-years of follow-up, 82 emergent HIV-1 seroconversions were reported, with an overall observed seroincidence rate of 1.05 per 100 person-years. Of the 82 seroconversions, 13 and 52 occurred in partner subjects randomized to emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and placebo, respectively. Two of the 13 seroconversions in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets arm and 3 of the 52 seroconversions in the placebo arm occurred in women during treatment interruptions for pregnancy. The risk reduction for Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets relative to placebo was 75% (95% CI: 55–87%). In a post-hoc case control study of plasma drug levels in about 10% of study subjects, risk reduction appeared to be greatest in subjects with detectable plasma tenofovir concentrations. Efficacy was therefore strongly correlated with adherence.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets are available as follows:<br/>

• That HIV-1 resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection who are taking emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets, because emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets alone does not constitute a complete regimen for HIV-1 treatment.<br/>
• The importance of taking emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets on a regular dosing schedule and strict adherence to the recommended dosing schedule to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1. Uninfected individuals who miss doses are at greater risk of acquiring HIV-1 than those who do not miss doses.<br/>
• That emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets does not prevent other sexually acquired infections and should only be used as part of a complete prevention strategy including other prevention measures.<br/>
• To use condoms consistently and correctly to lower the chances of sexual contact with any body fluids such as semen, vaginal secretions, or blood.<br/>
• The importance of knowing their HIV-1 status and the HIV-1 status of their partner(s).<br/>
• The importance of virologic suppression in their partner(s) with HIV-1.<br/>
• The need to get tested regularly for HIV-1 (at least every 3 months, or more frequently for some individuals such as adolescents) and to ask their partner(s) to get tested as well.<br/>
