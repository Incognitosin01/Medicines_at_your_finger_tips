High levels of this hormone can cause an imbalance that results in low sodium levels and fluid retention.</p><p>Samsca is used to treat hyponatremia (low levels of sodium in your blood) in people with heart failure, and certain hormonal imbalances.</p><p>Samsca improves urine flow without causing the body to lose too much sodium as you urinate.</p><p>This medication guide provides information about the Samsca brand of tolvaptan. Jynarque is another brand of tolvaptan that is not covered in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Samsca if are unable to urinate, if you are unable to tell when you are thirsty, or if you are severely dehydrated.</p><p>You will need to be in a hospital under observation any time you start or restart treatment.</p><p>Tell your doctor about all your current medicines and any you start or stop using.
