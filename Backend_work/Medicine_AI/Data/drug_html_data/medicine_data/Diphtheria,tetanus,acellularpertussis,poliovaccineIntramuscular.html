The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases. This vaccine is given only to children 4 to 6 years of age (before the child’s 7th birthday).</p><p>Diphtheria is a serious illness that can cause breathing difficulties, heart problems, nerve damage, pneumonia, and possibly death. The risk of serious complications is greater in very young children and the elderly.</p><p>Tetanus (also known as lockjaw) is a very serious illness that causes seizures and severe muscle spasms that can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. The disease continues to occur almost exclusively among people who do not get vaccinated or do not have enough protection from previous vaccines.</p><p>Pertussis (also known as whooping cough) is a serious disease that causes severe spells of coughing that can interfere with breathing. Pertussis can also cause pneumonia, long-lasting bronchitis, seizures, brain damage, and death.</p><p>Polio is a very serious infection that causes paralysis of the muscles, including the muscles that enable you to walk and breathe. A polio infection may leave a person unable to breathe without the help of a breathing machine. It may also leave a person unable to walk without leg braces or being confined to a wheelchair. There is no cure for polio.</p><p>This vaccine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your child’s doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, polio vaccine</h2><p>In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do.
