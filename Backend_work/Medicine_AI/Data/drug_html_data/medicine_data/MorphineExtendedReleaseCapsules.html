</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Morphine Extended Release Capsules</h2><p class="First">Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use:</span></p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended-release opioid formulations <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)],</span> reserve morphine sulfate extended-release capsules for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.</li>
<li>Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules are not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic.</li>
</ul><h2>Morphine Extended Release Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain.</p><p>Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules 100 mg, a single dose greater than 60 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 120 mg, are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. Patients considered opioid-tolerant are those taking, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone daily, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5)]</span>.</li>
<li>Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics"> </span>Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with morphine sulfate extended-release capsules and adjust the dosage accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></li>
</ul><p>Instruct patients to swallow morphine sulfate extended-release capsules whole <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>. Crushing, chewing, or dissolving the pellets in morphine sulfate extended-release capsules will result in uncontrolled delivery of morphine and can lead to overdose or death <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>Instruct patients who are unable to swallow morphine sulfate extended-release capsules to sprinkle the capsule contents on applesauce and immediately swallow without chewing <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].</span></p><p>Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules are administered orally at a frequency of either once daily (every 24 hours) or twice daily (every 12 hours).</p><h3>Initial Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Use of Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules as the First Opioid Analgesic (opioid-naïve patients)</span></p><p>There has been no evaluation of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules as an initial opioid analgesic in the management of pain. Because it may be more difficult to titrate a patient to adequate analgesia using an extended-release morphine, begin treatment using an immediate-release morphine formulation and then convert patients to morphine sulfate extended-release capsules as described below.</p><p><span class="Bold">Use of Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules in Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant (opioid non-tolerant patients)</span></p><p>The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is morphine sulfate extended-release capsules 30 mg orally every 24 hours.</p><p>Use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from Other Opioids to Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules</span></p><p>Discontinue all other around-the-clock opioid drugs when morphine sulfate extended-release capsules therapy is initiated.</p><p>There are no established conversion ratios from other opioids to morphine sulfate extended-release capsules defined by clinical trials. Initiate dosing using morphine sulfate extended-release capsules 30 mg orally every 24 hours.</p><p>It is safer to underestimate a patient’s 24-hour oral morphine dosage and provide rescue medication (e.g. immediate-release morphine) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral morphine dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to an overdose. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and formulations.</p><p>Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and for signs of oversedation/toxicity after converting patients to morphine sulfate extended-release capsules.</p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from Other Oral Morphine Formulations to Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules</span></p><p>Patients receiving other oral morphine formulations may be converted to morphine sulfate extended-release capsules by administering one-half of the patient’s total daily oral morphine dose as morphine sulfate extended-release capsules twice daily or by administering the total daily oral morphine dose as morphine sulfate extended-release capsules once daily. There are no data to support the efficacy or safety of prescribing morphine sulfate extended-release capsules more frequently than every 12 hours.</p><p>Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules are not bioequivalent to other extended-release morphine preparations. Conversion from the same total daily dose of another extended-release morphine product to morphine sulfate extended-release capsules may lead to either excessive sedation at peak or inadequate analgesia at trough. Therefore, monitor patients closely when initiating morphine sulfate extended-release capsules therapy and adjust the dosage of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules as needed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from Parenteral Morphine, or Other Opioids to Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules</span></p><p>When converting from parenteral morphine or other non-morphine opioids (parenteral or oral) to morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, consider the following general points:</p><p><span class="Italics">Parenteral to Oral Morphine Ratio<br/></span> Between 2 mg and 6 mg of oral morphine may be required to provide analgesia equivalent to 1 mg of parenteral morphine. Typically, a     dose of oral morphine that is three times the daily parenteral morphine requirement is sufficient.</p><p><span class="Italics">Other Oral or Parenteral Opioids to Oral Morphine <span class="Italics">Ratios</span><br/></span> Specific recommendations are not available because of a lack of systematic evidence for these types of analgesic substitutions.     Published relative potency data are available, but such ratios are approximations. In general, begin with half of the estimated daily     morphine requirement as the initial dose, managing inadequate analgesia by supplementation with immediate-release morphine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from Methadone to Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules</span></p><p>Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma.</p><h3>Titration and Maintenance of Therapy</h3><p class="First">Individually titrate morphine sulfate extended-release capsules to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving morphine sulfate extended-release capsules to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics.</p><p>Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dosage adjustment of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the morphine sulfate extended-release capsules dosage. In patients experiencing inadequate analgesia with once daily dosing of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, consider a twice daily regimen. Because steady-state plasma concentrations are approximated within 24 to 36 hours, morphine sulfate extended-release capsules dosage adjustments may be done every 1 to 2 days.</p><p>If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.</p><h3>Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules</h3><p class="First">Do not abruptly discontinue morphine sulfate extended-release capsules in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.</p><p>When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.</p><p>There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on morphine sulfate extended-release capsules who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.</p><p>It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.</p><p>When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Italics">Warnings</span> <span class="Italics">and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.13)</span>, Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Administration of Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules</h3><p class="First">Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules must be taken whole. Crushing, chewing, or dissolving the pellets in morphine sulfate extended-release capsules will result in uncontrolled delivery of morphine and can lead to overdose or death <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>Alternatively, the contents of the morphine sulfate extended-release capsules (pellets) may be sprinkled over applesauce and then swallowed. This method is appropriate only for patients able to reliably swallow the applesauce without chewing. Other foods have not been tested and should not be substituted for applesauce. Instruct the patient to:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Sprinkle the pellets onto a small amount of applesauce and consume immediately without chewing.</li>
<li>Rinse the mouth to ensure all pellets have been swallowed.</li>
<li>Discard any unused portion of the morphine sulfate extended-release capsules after the contents have been sprinkled on applesauce.</li>
</ul><p>The contents of the morphine sulfate extended-release capsules (pellets) may be administered through a French gastrostomy tube.</p><p>Do not administer morphine sulfate extended-release capsules pellets through a nasogastric tube.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, USP contains white to off-white polymer-coated extended-release pellets of morphine sulfate, USP, have an outer opaque capsule with colors and imprints as identified below, and are available in seven dose strengths.</p><p>Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules USP, 20 mg, has a yellow opaque body and cap, imprinted with “J62” in black ink on cap.</p><p>Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules USP, 30 mg, has a violet opaque body and cap, imprinted with “J63” in black ink on cap.</p><p>Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules USP, 40 mg, has a blue violet opaque body and rich yellow opaque cap, imprinted with “J69” in black ink on cap.</p><p>Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules USP, 50 mg, has a light blue opaque body and cap, imprinted with “J64” in black ink on cap.</p><p>Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules  USP, 60 mg, has a red opaque body and cap, imprinted with “J65” in black ink on cap.</p><p>Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules USP, 80 mg, has an orange opaque body and cap, imprinted with “J66” in black ink on cap.</p><p>Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules USP, 100 mg, has a light green opaque body and cap, imprinted with “J67” in black ink on cap.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules are contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Significant respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics"> </span>Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics"> </span>Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or use of MAOIs within the last 14 days <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7),</span> <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)]</span></li>

<li><span class="Italics"> </span>Hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to morphine <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</h3><p class="First">Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules contains morphine, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, morphine sulfate extended-release capsules expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Because extended-release products such as morphine sulfate extended-release capsules deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of morphine present <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]</span>.</p><p>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed morphine sulfate extended-release capsules. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused.</p><p>Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, and monitor all patients receiving morphine sulfate extended-release capsules for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</p><p>Abuse or misuse of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of morphine and can result in overdose and death <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing morphine sulfate extended-release capsules. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><h3>Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)</h3><p class="First">To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Healthcare Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.</li>
<li>Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG.</li>
<li>Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them.</li>
<li>Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities.</li>
</ul><p>To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com. The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint.</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>. Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules.</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules are essential <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>. Overestimating the morphine sulfate extended-release capsules dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of morphine.</p><p>Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2.4)</span>].</span></p><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Prolonged use of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First">Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when morphine sulfate extended-release capsules is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><p>Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on morphine sulfate extended-release capsules therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with morphine sulfate extended-release capsules may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of morphine.</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</h3><p class="First">The use of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:</span> Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients:</span> Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><p>Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating morphine sulfate extended-release capsules and when morphine sulfate extended-release capsules are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span> Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.</p><h3>Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may potentiate the effects of morphine, including respiratory depression, coma, and confusion. Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.</p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><h3>Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules. In patients with circulatory shock, morphine sulfate extended-release capsules may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules in patients with circulatory shock.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness</h3><p class="First">In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), morphine sulfate extended-release capsules may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with morphine sulfate extended-release capsules.</p><p>Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First">Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>The morphine in morphine sulfate extended-release capsules may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</h3><p class="First">The morphine in morphine sulfate extended-release capsules may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during morphine sulfate extended-release capsules therapy.</p><h3>Withdrawal</h3><p class="First">Do not abruptly discontinue morphine sulfate extended-release capsules in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing morphine sulfate extended-release capsules in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of morphine in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2.4)</span>, <span class="Italics">Drug Abuse and Dependence</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">9.3)</span>]</span>.</p><p>Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including morphine sulfate extended-release capsules. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonists and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p><br/></p><h3>Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery</h3><p class="First">Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules and know how they will react to the medication <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:</p><ul class="Disk">

opioid analgesics during pregnancy can cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span> There are no available data with morphine sulfate extended-release capsules in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Published studies with morphine use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with morphine and major birth defects <span class="Italics">[see Human Data]</span>. In published animal reproduction studies, morphine administered subcutaneously during the early gestational period produced neural tube defects (i.e., exencephaly and cranioschisis) at 5 and 16 times the human daily dose of 60 mg based on body surface area (HDD) in hamsters and mice, respectively, lower fetal body weight and increased incidence of abortion at 0.4 times the HDD in the rabbit, growth retardation at 6 times the HDD in the rat, and axial skeletal fusion and cryptorchidism at 16 times the HDD in the mouse. Administration of morphine sulfate to pregnant rats during organogenesis and through lactation resulted in cyanosis, hypothermia, decreased brain weights, pup mortality, decreased pup body weights, and adverse effects on reproductive tissues at 3 to 4 times the HDD; and long-term neurochemical changes in the brain of offspring which correlate with altered behavioral responses that persist through adulthood at exposures comparable to and less than the HDD <span class="Italics">[see Animal Data]</span>. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Labor or Delivery</span></p><p>Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when use of shorter-acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>The results from a population-based prospective cohort, including 70 women exposed to morphine during the first trimester of pregnancy and 448 women exposed to morphine at any time during pregnancy, indicate no increased risk for congenital malformations. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and non-randomized study design.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Formal reproductive and developmental toxicology studies for morphine have not been conducted. Exposure margins for the following published study reports are based on human daily dose of 60 mg morphine using a body surface area comparison (HDD).</p><p>Neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of morphine sulfate (35 to 322 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (4.7 to 43.5 times the HDD). A no adverse effect level was not defined in this study and the findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. Neural tube defects (exencephaly), axial skeletal fusions, and cryptorchidism were reported following a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of morphine sulfate to pregnant mice (100 to 500 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 or 9 at 200 mg/kg or greater (16 times the HDD) and fetal resorption at 400 mg/kg or higher (32 times the HDD). No adverse effects were noted following 100 mg/kg morphine in this model (8 times the HDD). In one study, following continuous subcutaneous infusion of doses greater than or equal to 2.72 mg/kg to mice (0.2 times the HDD), exencephaly, hydronephrosis, intestinal hemorrhage, split supraoccipital, malformed sternebrae, and malformed xiphoid were noted. The effects were reduced with increasing daily dose; possibly due to rapid induction of tolerance under these infusion conditions. The clinical significance of this report is not clear.</p><p>Decreased fetal weights were observed in pregnant rats treated with 20 mg/kg/day morphine sulfate (3.2 times the HDD) from Gestation Day 7 to 9. There was no evidence of malformations despite maternal toxicity (10% mortality). In a second rat study, decreased fetal weight and increased incidences of growth retardation were noted at 35 mg/kg/day (5.7 times the HDD) and there was a reduced number of fetuses at 70 mg/kg/day (11.4 times the HDD) when pregnant rats were treated with 10, 35, or 70 mg/kg/day morphine sulfate via continuous infusion from Gestation Day 5 to 20. There was no evidence of fetal malformations or maternal toxicity.</p><p>An increased incidence of abortion was noted in a study in which pregnant rabbits were treated with 2.5 (0.8 times the HDD) to 10 mg/kg morphine sulfate via subcutaneous injection from Gestation Day 6 to 10. In a second study, decreased fetal body weights were reported following treatment of pregnant rabbits with increasing doses of morphine (10 to 50 mg/kg/day) during the pre-mating period and 50 mg/kg/day (16 times the HDD) throughout the gestation period. No overt malformations were reported in either publication; although only limited endpoints were evaluated.</p><p>In published studies in rats, exposure to morphine during gestation and/or lactation periods is associated with: decreased pup viability at 12.5 mg/kg/day or greater (2 times the HDD); decreased pup body weights at 15 mg/kg/day or greater (2.4 times the HDD); decreased litter size, decreased absolute brain and cerebellar weights, cyanosis, and hypothermia at 20 mg/kg/day (3.2 times the HDD); alteration of behavioral responses (play, social-interaction) at 1 mg/kg/day or greater (0.2 times the HDD); alteration of maternal behaviors (e.g., decreased nursing and pup retrievals) in mice at 1 mg/kg or higher (0.08 times the HDD) and rats at 1.5 mg/kg/day or higher (0.2 times the HDD); and a host of behavioral abnormalities in the offspring of rats, including altered responsiveness to opioids at 4 mg/kg/day (0.7 times the HDD) or greater.</p><p>Fetal and/or postnatal exposure to morphine in mice and rats has been shown to result in morphological changes in fetal and neonatal brain and neuronal cell loss, alteration of a number of neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems, including opioid and non-opioid systems, and impairment in various learning and memory tests that appear to persist into adulthood. These studies were conducted with morphine treatment usually in the range of 4 to 20 mg/kg/day (0.7 to 3.2 times the HDD).</p><p>Additionally, delayed sexual maturation and decreased sexual behaviors in female offspring at 20 mg/kg/day (3.2 times the HDD), and decreased plasma and testicular levels of luteinizing hormone and testosterone, decreased testes weights, seminiferous tubule shrinkage, germinal cell aplasia, and decreased spermatogenesis in male offspring were also observed at 20 mg/kg/day (3.2 times the HDD). Decreased litter size and viability were observed in the offspring of male rats that were intraperitoneally administered morphine sulfate for 1 day prior to mating at 25 mg/kg/day (4.1 times the HDD) and mated to untreated females. Decreased viability and body weight and/or movement deficits in both first and second generation offspring were reported when male mice were treated for 5 days with escalating doses of 120 to 240 mg/kg/day morphine sulfate (9.7 to 19.5 times the HDD) or when female mice treated with escalating doses of 60 to 240 mg/kg/day (4.9 to 19.5 times the HDD) followed by a 5-day treatment-free recovery period prior to mating. Similar multigenerational findings were also seen in female rats pre-gestationally treated with escalating doses of 10 to 22 mg/kg/day morphine (1.6 to 3.6 times the HDD).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Morphine is present in breast milk. Published lactation studies report variable concentrations of morphine in breast milk with administration of immediate-release morphine to nursing mothers in the early postpartum period with a milk-to-plasma morphine AUC ratio of 2.5:1 measured in one lactation study. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of morphine on the breastfed infant and the effects of morphine on milk production. Lactation studies have not been conducted with extended–release morphine, including morphine sulfate extended-release capsules.</p><p>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with morphine sulfate extended-release capsules.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Monitor infants exposed to morphine sulfate extended-release capsules through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of morphine is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p>Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><p>In published animal studies, morphine administration adversely effected fertility and reproductive endpoints in male rats and prolonged estrus cycle in female rats <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules in patients less than 18 years have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p><p>Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to morphine. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules slowly in geriatric patients and monitor for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><p>Morphine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Morphine pharmacokinetics have been reported to be significantly altered in patients with cirrhosis. Start these patients with a lower than usual dosage of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules and titrate slowly while monitoring for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Morphine pharmacokinetics are altered in patients with renal failure. Start these patients with a lower than usual dosage of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules and titrate slowly while monitoring for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules contain morphine, a Schedule II controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules contains morphine, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>The high drug content in extended-release formulations adds to the risk of adverse outcomes from abuse and misuse.</p><p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of an over-the-counter or prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p><p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</p><p>"Drug seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other healthcare provider(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state  and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks Specific to Abuse of Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules</span></p><p>Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules are for oral use only. Abuse of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules poses a risk of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved morphine sulfate extended-release capsules enhances drug release and increases the risk of over dose and death.</p><p>Due to the presence of talc as one of the excipients in morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, parenteral abuse can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, embolism and death, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p><p>Physical dependence is a physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after a period of regular exposure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</p><p>Do not abruptly discontinue morphine sulfate extended-release capsules in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.</p><p>When discontinuing morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]</span>.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal symptoms <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">8.2)</span>, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation<br/></span></p><p>Acute overdosage with morphine can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment of Overdose<br/></span></p><p>In cases of overdose, priorities are the re-establishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to morphine overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to morphine overdose.</p><p>Because the duration of reversal would be expected to be less than the duration of action of morphine in morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules will continue to release morphine add to the morphine load for 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion, necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed in the product’s prescribing information.</p><p>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p><h2>Morphine Extended Release Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules, USP, an opioid agonist, are for oral use and contain pellets of morphine sulfate.</p><p>Each morphine sulfate extended-release capsule, USP contains either 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg, 80 mg, or 100 mg of morphine sulfate, USP and the following inactive ingredients common to all strengths: hypromellose, ethylcellulose, methacrylic acid copolymer, polyethylene glycol, diethyl phthalate, talc, corn starch, and sucrose.</p><p>The capsule shells contain gelatin and titanium dioxide.

The principal therapeutic action of morphine is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.</p><p>The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CNS Depressant/Alcohol Interaction</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><br/></span></span> Additive pharmacodynamic effects may be expected when morphine sulfate extended-release capsules are used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Central Nervous System</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><br/></span></span> Morphine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brainstem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brainstem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.</p><p>Morphine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><br/></span></span> Morphine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><br/></span></span> Morphine produces peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Endocrine System</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><br/></span></span> Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Immune System</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><br/></span></span> Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.</p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration-Efficacy Relationships</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><br/></span></span> The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of morphine for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration–Adverse Reaction Relationships</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><br/></span></span> There is a relationship between increasing morphine plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)].</span></span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules contain polymer coated extended-release pellets of morphine sulfate that release morphine significantly more slowly than oral morphine solution. Following the administration of oral morphine solution, approximately 50% of the morphine absorbed reaches the systemic circulation within 30 minutes compared to 8 hours with an equal amount of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules. Because of pre-systemic elimination, only about 20% to 40% of the administered dose reaches the systemic circulation.</p><p>Both dose-normalized C<span class="Sub">max</span> and dose-normalized AUC<span class="Sub">0-48hr</span> values of morphine after a single dose administration of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules in healthy volunteers are less than those for morphine oral solution or an extended-release tablet formulation (Table 2).</p><p>When morphine sulfate extended-release capsules were given twice daily to 24 patients with chronic pain due to malignancy, steady-state was achieved in about two days. At steady-state, morphine sulfate extended-release capsules have a significantly lower C<span class="Sub">max</span> and a higher C<span class="Sub">min</span> than equivalent doses of oral morphine solution given every 4 hours and an extended-release tablet given twice daily.

The volume of distribution of morphine is approximately 3 to 4 L/kg. Morphine is 30% to 35% reversibly bound to plasma proteins. Although the primary site of action of morphine is in the CNS, only small quantities pass the blood-brain barrier.

A small fraction (less than 5%) of morphine is demethylated. M3G has no significant contribution to the analgesic activity. Although M6G does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, it has been shown to have opioid agonist and analgesic activity in humans.</p><p>Studies in healthy subjects and cancer patients have shown that the glucuronide metabolite to morphine mean molar ratios (based on AUC) are similar after both single doses and at steady-state for morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, 12-hour extended-release morphine sulfate tablets and morphine sulfate solution.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Approximately 10% of a morphine dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted in the urine as M3G and M6G which are then renally excreted. A small amount of the glucuronide metabolites is excreted in the bile and there is some minor enterohepatic cycling. Seven to 10% of administered morphine is excreted in the feces.</p><p>The mean adult plasma clearance of morphine is about 20 to 30 mL/minute/kg. The effective terminal half-life of morphine after IV administration is reported to be approximately 2 hours.
