Insert blood collection tube firmly into the tube holder; when full, remove sample tube from holder. Repeat to collect additional samples.</p><p>2.15.5. <span class="Bold">NOTE:</span> The pouch may be removed after the donor test samples are collected.</p><p>A second seal must be made between the diversion pouch and the permanent seal prior to removing the pouch.</p><p></p><p>2.16. Mix blood with anticoagulant in the collection bag and continue to mix at several intervals during collection and immediately after collection. If using an automated mixer, follow manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>2.17. Collect labeled volume of blood 500 mL ±10%.</p><p>2.18. When the desired amount of blood has been collected, seal the tubing or tighten the loose knot (white knot) prepared in Step 2.3. Make a second seal between the first seal or knot and the "Y". Various methods may be used to seal tubing.</p><p>2.19. Release pressure on the donor's arm and remove the needle into the needle safety device following the device instructions provided on the reverse side. Sever the donor tubing between the two seals previously made below the CLIKTIP and "Y".</p><p>2.19.1. <span class="Bold">CAUTION:</span> Discard the Diversion Blood Sampling Arm and phlebotomy needle/donor tubing according to institutional standard operating procedures.</p><p>2.20. Seal and remove donor tubing from collection bag or strip donor tubing as follows:</p><p>2.20.1. To obtain a quality control prefiltration sample, strip blood from donor tubing into collection bag, mix well, and allow tubing to refill; repeat once. To prevent the blood from clotting in the tubing, work quickly as possible. Leave an adequate length of tubing containing the well-mixed anticoagulated whole blood attached to the collection bag.</p><p>2.20.2. Or, to maximize collection recovery, strip the tubing, mix well and seal tubing close to the collection bag without refilling. To prevent the blood from clotting in the tubing, work quickly as possible. Remove tubing from collection bag.</p><p>2.21. The blood filtration is executed according to the following operation. (see Fig.4)</p><p>2.21.1. <span class="Bold">NOTE:</span> Red blood cells collected from certain donors may have extended filtration times and the potential for ineffective filtration and leukoreduction.</p><p>2.21.2. <span class="Bold">NOTE:</span> Wait 30 minutes after collection before filtering. Filtration can be accomplished at room temperature for units maintained at room temperature and filtered within 8 hours of collection. Filtration can also be performed with units cooled towards 1-10°C within 8 hours of collection (e.g., during transport). If any unit has not completely filtered by 8 hours post collection, filtration must be completed at 1-6°C. Filtration can be unattended.</p><p></p><p>2.22. Mix the unfiltered whole blood unit by inverting the collection bag #1 (pre-filter bag) several times.</p><p>2.23. Hang the collection bag #1 and extend the filtration set to full length. Verify that the filter is vertical and ensure all tubing is freely suspended without kinks.</p><p>2.24. Break the CLIKTIP at the outlet of the collection bag #1.</p><p>2.24.1. The filter housing will begin to fill with blood and expand on the non-textured side.</p><p>2.24.2. Blood will flow across the filter pads and expand the textured side of the filter housing.</p><p>2.24.3. Air from the bag and filter will be forced into the primary bag #2 (post-filtration bag).</p><p>2.24.3.1. <span class="Bold">CAUTION:</span> Do not squeeze or apply pressure on the filter while it is attached to the bag containing the filtered blood.</p><p>2.25. Filtration ends when the filter has emptied and the housing has collapsed onto the filter pads.</p><p>2.25.1. <span class="Bold">NOTE:</span> Verify that collection bag #1 and pre-filtration tubing has emptied.</p><p>2.26. Gently squeeze the primary bag #2 to expel the air in the bag up the numbered segment tubing line and into the filter. To ensure ease of air removal ensure primary bag #2 is below the filter outlet.</p><p>2.27. Fill the numbered segment tubing with blood while expelling the air.</p><p>2.28. Clamp the blood filled tubing before blood enters the filter.</p><p>2.29. Seal the tubing as close as possible to the filter outlet and properly dispose of the filter and collection bag #1.</p><p>2.30. Strip the post filter tubing into the primary bag #2, mix well, and allow tubing to refill; repeat once. Make an appropriate number of segments of anticoagulated blood for testing by sealing on or near the X marks. Leave segments attached to the filtered whole blood unit.</p><p>2.31. The time between Whole Blood collection and component separation may vary depending on both the blood bag system and processing options selected.</p><p>2.31.1. <span class="Bold">NOTE:</span> Production of Platelet concentrates is not intended with this product.</p><p>2.31.2. <span class="Bold">NOTE:</span> Fresh Frozen Plasma should be separated from the Red Blood Cells and placed in a freezer at –18°C or colder within 8 hours of collection.</p><p>2.31.3. <span class="Bold">NOTE:</span> OPTISOL should be added to the Red Blood Cells immediately after removal of the plasma. If plasma is not separated from the Red Blood Cells within 8 hours, OPTISOL may be added within 72 hours of collection if Whole Blood is refrigerated.</p><p>2.32. Follow your institution's standard component processing procedures to prepare components.</p><p>2.33. Centrifuge filtered whole blood unit to separate red cells from plasma.</p><p>2.34.
