Adequate amounts of iron are necessary for effective erythropolesis. Iron also serves as a cofactor of several essential enzymes, including cytochromes that are involved in electron transport.</p><p>FOLIC ACID is required for nucleoprotein synthesis and the maintenance of normal erythropolesis. Folic acid is converted in the liver and plasma to its metabolically active form, tetrahydrofolic acid, by dihydrofolate reductase.</p><p>VITAMIN B12 is required for the maintenance of normal erythropolesis, nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis, cell reproduction and normal growth. Intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the gastric mucosa, is required for active absorption of vitamin B12 from the gastrointestinal tract.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Maxaron Forte Capsules</h2><p class="First">MAXARON™ FORTE is indicated for the prevention and treatment of iron deficiency anemia and/or nutritional megaloblastic anemias.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">MAXARON™ FORTE is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of this product. Hemochromatosis and hemosiderosis are contraindications to iron therapy.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B12 is deficient.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">The type of anemia and the underlying cause or causes should be determined before starting therapy with MAXARON™ FORTE. Since the anemia may be a result of a systemic disturbance, such as recurrent blood loss, the underlying cause or causes should be corrected, if possible.</p><p>Folic acid in doses above 1.0 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hemotologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients has not been established.</p><h3>Information or Patients</h3><p class="First">As with all oral iron preparations, MAXARON™ FORTE should be stored out of the reach of children to guard against accidental iron poisoning. Patients should not exceed the recommended dosage unless directed by the physician. Patients should be informed that iron therapy can cause black or dark stools.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions with iron therapy may include constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dark stools and abdominal pain. Adverse reactions with iron therapy are usually transient. Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.</p><p>The clinical cause of acute iron overdosage can be variable. Initial symptoms may include: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tarry stools, melena, hematemesis, hypotension, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, dehydration, drowsiness, pallor, cyanosis, lassitude, seizures, shock and coma.</p><p>The oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of polysaccharide-iron complex was estimated to be greater than 5000 mg. iron/kg in rats. Chronic toxicity studies in rats and dogs administered polysaccharide-iron complex showed that a daily dosage of 250 mg iron/kg for three months had no adverse effects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Warning: Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose seek professional assistance or contact a poison control center immediately.</span></p><h2>Maxaron Forte Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Adults</h3><p class="First">One capsule daily or as directed by a physician.</p><h2>How is Maxaron Forte Capsules Supplied</h2><p class="First">MAXARON™ FORTE capsules are orange colored with imprint CENTRIX 135.
