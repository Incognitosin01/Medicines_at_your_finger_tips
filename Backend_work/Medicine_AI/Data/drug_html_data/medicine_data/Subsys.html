An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic.</p><p>Subsys spray is used to treat "breakthrough" cancer pain that is not controlled by other medicines. Subsys is taken together with other non-fentanyl narcotic pain medicines that are used around the clock.</p><p>Subsys is not for treating pain that is not cancer-related.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Do not use Subsys to replace any other form of fentanyl, such as Actiq, Fentora, Onsolis, Duragesic, Lazanda, or generic brands of fentanyl (injection, skin patch, dissolving film, or "lollipop" device). Subsys is available only from a certified pharmacy under a special program. You must be registered in the program and understand the risks and benefits of taking this medication.</p><p>Do not use Subsys spray unless you are already being treated with a similar opioid pain medicine and your body is tolerant to it. Talk with your doctor if you are not sure you are opioid-tolerant.</p><p>Subsys is not for treating pain that is not cancer-related, such as pain from surgery or dental work, migraine headaches, or back pain.</p><p>Fentanyl can slow or stop your breathing, especially when you start using this medicine or whenever your dose is changed. Never take Subsys in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed.</p><p>Some medicines can interact with fentanyl and worsen the effects on your breathing. Before using this medicine, tell your doctor if you are taking an antibiotic or any medicines to treat high blood pressure, heart rhythm disorders, depression, or viral infections such as hepatitis, HIV or AIDS.</p><p><b>Fatal side effects can occur if you use this medicine with alcohol, or with other drugs that cause drowsiness or slow your breathing.</b></p><p>Fentanyl may be habit-forming, even at regular doses. Take this medicine exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Never share the medicine with another person. MISUSE OF NARCOTIC PAIN MEDICATION CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p><b>Do not use Subsys unless you are already using an around-the-clock opioid medicine and are tolerant to it.</b> You should not use Subsys if you are allergic to fentanyl, or if you have:</p><ul>

Follow all directions on your prescription label. Fentanyl can slow or stop your breathing. Take this medicine exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain.</p><p>Fentanyl may be habit-forming. Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. <b>MISUSE OF NARCOTIC MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Selling or giving away fentanyl is against the law.</p><p>Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>Do not use Subsys to replace any other form of fentanyl, such as Actiq, Fentora, Onsolis, Duragesic, Lazanda, or generic brands of fentanyl (injection, skin patch, dissolving film, or "lollipop" device).</p><p>If you switch to Subsys from another form of fentanyl, you will not use the same dose. You must start with the lowest dose (100 micrograms). Your doctor may change your dose to make sure you get the best results.</p><p>Point the Subsys spray nozzle into your mouth, lift your tongue, and spray the medicine under your tongue. Hold the liquid under the tongue for 30 to 60 seconds. Do not spit, swallow, or rinse your mouth during this time.</p><p>You may use a second dose of Subsys 30 minutes after the first. Use only the same strength and amount you used for the first dose. Call your doctor if you still have pain after taking the second tablet. Do not take more than 2 doses for each episode of breakthrough cancer pain.</p><p>You must wait at least 4 hours after your last dose of Subsys before you can treat a new pain episode.</p><p>Call your doctor if you have breakthrough pain more than 4 times in one day while using this medicine. <b>Do not treat more than 4 pain episodes per day with this medicine.</b></p><p>Do not stop using Subsys suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine.</p><p>Store at room temperature, away from heat and moisture. Do not freeze. Keep your medicine in a place where others cannot get to it. Keep track of the amount of medicine used. Fentanyl is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Keep this medicine out of the reach of children or pets. <b>The amount of fentanyl in each Subsys spray unit can be fatal to a child or pet who accidentally sucks on or swallows it.</b> Seek emergency medical attention if this happens.</p><p>Carefully follow disposal instructions when this medicine is no longer needed. Dispose of used Subsys spray units in the disposal bags provided with this medication.
