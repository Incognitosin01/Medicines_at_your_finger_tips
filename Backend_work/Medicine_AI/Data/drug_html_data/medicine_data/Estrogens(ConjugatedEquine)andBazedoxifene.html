Bazedoxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Conjugated estrogens act as an estrogen agonist and bazedoxifene acts as an estrogen agonist/antagonist depending on the specific tissue. The combination of a SERM and estrogen [referred to as a tissue-selective estrogen complex (TSEC)] provides relief of vasomotor symptoms and maintenance of bone mineral density in postmenopausal females with a uterus, while reducing the risk of endometrial hyperplasia observed with estrogen use alone (Pickar 2009).</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Conjugated estrogens: Well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Bazedoxifene: V<sub>d</sub>: ~15 L/kg</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Bazedoxifene: Metabolized via glucuronidation; forms metabolites; little or no CYP mediated metabolism; undergoes hepatic recirculation</p><p>Conjugated estrogens: Hepatic via CYP3A4; estradiol is converted to estrone and estriol; also undergoes enterohepatic recirculation; estrone sulfate is the main metabolite in postmenopausal females</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Conjugated estrogens: Urine (primarily estriol, also as estradiol, estrone, and conjugates)</p><p>Bazedoxifene: Biliary; feces (~85%); urine (&lt;1%)</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>Relief of vasomotor symptoms: A significant reduction in the number and severity of moderate/severe hot flashes was observed after 4 weeks of therapy (Pinkerton, 2009).</p><p>Osteoporosis: A significant increase in BMD measured at the lumbar spine and hip was observed at 12 months of therapy (Lindsay, 2009).</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Bazedoxifene: ~2.5 hours</p><p>Total estrone: ~6.5 hours</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Bazedoxifene: ~30 hours</p><p>Total estrone: ~17 hours</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>Bazedoxifene: 98% to 99%; does not bind to sex-hormone binding globulin</p><p>Conjugated estrogens: Binds to sex-hormone-binding globulin and albumin</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Osteoporosis, prevention:</b> Prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in females with a uterus.</p><p>Limitations of use: For use only in women at significant risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis; consider use of nonestrogen medications.</p><p><b>Vasomotor symptoms:</b> Treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in females with a uterus.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to estrogens, bazedoxifene, or any component of the formulation; undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding; active or past history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (eg, PE, DVT); active or history of arterial thromboembolic disease (eg, stroke, MI); carcinoma of the breast (known, suspected or history of); estrogen-dependent tumor (known or suspected); hepatic impairment or disease; known protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency or other known thrombophilic disorders; pregnancy.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling: </i>Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Active thrombophlebitis; endometrial hyperplasia; partial or complete loss of vision due to ophthalmic vascular disease.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>General dosing guidelines:</b> When treating symptoms of menopause, hormone therapy should be evaluated routinely for appropriate dose, duration, and route of administration for each individual patient based on treatment goals, risk factors, and overall health (NAMS 2017).</p><p><b>Osteoporosis, prevention (postmenopausal females):</b> Oral: Conjugated estrogens 0.45 mg and bazedoxifene 20 mg once daily.</p><p><b>Vasomotor symptoms (moderate to severe) associated with menopause:</b> Oral: Conjugated estrogens 0.45 mg and bazedoxifene 20 mg once daily.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Females &gt;65 years of age should be assessed for benefits and risks of treatment; possible adjustments to safer lower-dose and/or route of administration should be considered (ACOG 565 2013; NAMS 2017).

Conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Perform adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.</p><p>Do not use estrogen therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen-alone substudy reported increased risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 7.1 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg) alone, relative to placebo.</p><p>Do not use estrogen therapy for the prevention of dementia. The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years and older during 5.2 years of treatment with daily conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg) alone, relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women.</p><p>Women taking conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene should not take additional estrogens. In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of conjugated estrogens and other dosage forms of estrogens. Estrogens should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Breast cancer: Based on data from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies, an increased risk of invasive breast cancer was observed in postmenopausal females using conjugated estrogens (CE) in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Observational studies noted this risk declines once therapy is discontinued. The WHI study did not observe an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in females with a hysterectomy using CE alone. The risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal patients on hormone therapy may depend upon type of estrogen and/or progestin, dose, timing of therapy initiation, duration of therapy, route of administration, and individual patient characteristics (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]; NAMS 2017). Hormone therapy may be associated with increased breast density (NAMS 2017); an increase in abnormal mammogram findings requiring further evaluation has been reported with estrogen alone or in combination with progestin therapy. Estrogen use may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases; discontinue estrogen if hypercalcemia occurs.</p><p>• Dementia: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: In the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), an increased incidence of probable dementia was observed in women ≥65 years of age taking CE alone. It is not known if this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women. Estrogens should not be used for the prevention of dementia. </b>Because the WHI memory studies were conducted in females ≥65 years of age, it is unknown if these findings apply to younger postmenopausal females. However, hormone therapy is not recommended at any age to prevent or treat cognitive decline or dementia (AACE [Goodman 2011]; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Endometrial cancer: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: The use of unopposed estrogen in women with an intact uterus is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Estrogens (conjugated/equine) in combination with bazedoxifene has been shown to decrease the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, a precursor to endometrial cancer. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling if indicated, should be performed to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding. Women taking this combination should not take additional estrogen</b> (may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia).</p><p>• Lipid effects: Estrogen compounds are generally associated with lipid effects such as increased HDL-cholesterol and decreased LDL-cholesterol. Triglycerides may also be increased; discontinue if pancreatitis occurs.</p><p>• Ovarian cancer: Available information related to the use of menopausal estrogen or estrogen/progestin therapy and risk of ovarian cancer is inconsistent. If an association is present, the absolute risk is likely rare and may be influenced by duration of therapy (AACE [Goodman 2011]; ES [Stuenkel 2015]; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Retinal vascular thrombosis: Estrogens may cause retinal vascular thrombosis; discontinue pending examination if migraine, loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, or other visual disturbances occur; discontinue permanently if papilledema or retinal vascular lesions are observed on examination.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Asthma: Use caution in patients with asthma; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Carbohydrate intolerance: May impair glucose tolerance; use caution in patients with diabetes. Prior to therapy, consider age, cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in patients previously diagnosed with diabetes (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]).</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Estrogens should not be used to prevent cardiovascular disease. Using data from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies, an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stroke has been reported with CE in postmenopausal women 50 to 79 years of age.</b> Estrogens and bazedoxifene are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Additional risk factors include diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, SLE, obesity, tobacco use, and/or history of VTE. Risk factors should be managed appropriately; discontinue use immediately if adverse cardiovascular events occur or are suspected. Due to possible lower risk of thrombotic events, transdermal administration may be preferred for treating vasomotor symptoms of menopause in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]; ACOG 556 2013; ES [Stuenkel 2015]). Use is contraindicated in females with active DVT, PE, arterial thromboembolic disease (stroke and MI), or a history of these conditions.</p><p>• Diseases exacerbated by fluid retention: Use with caution in patients with diseases which may be exacerbated by fluid retention, including cardiac or renal dysfunction.</p><p>• Epilepsy: Use caution with epilepsy; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Gallbladder disease: Use of postmenopausal estrogen may be associated with an increased risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery.</p><p>• Hepatic dysfunction: Estrogens are poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Use caution with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with prior estrogen use or pregnancy. Discontinue if jaundice develops or if acute or chronic hepatic disturbances occur. Use is contraindicated with hepatic disease.</p><p>• Hepatic hemangiomas: Use with caution in patients with hepatic hemangiomas; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Hereditary angioedema: Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate angioedema symptoms in females with hereditary angioedema.</p><p>• Hypoparathyroidism: Use caution in patients with hypoparathyroidism; estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.</p><p>• Migraine: Use caution with migraine; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Porphyria: Use with caution in patients with porphyria; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• SLE: Use with caution in patients with SLE; may exacerbate disease.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Thyroid replacement therapy: Estrogens may increase thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels. Females on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone while receiving estrogens.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Overweight/Obese: Bazedoxifene exposure is decreased in females with a BMI &gt;27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> which may be associated with an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia. Females with a BMI &gt;34 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or &gt;32.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were excluded from some initial vasomotor or osteoporosis studies, respectively (Lindsay 2009; Pinkerton 2009). Regardless of BMI, monitoring should be done to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal females with undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal genital bleeding.</p><p>• Surgical patients: Whenever possible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to elective surgery associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism or during periods of prolonged immobilization.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Duration of use: Extended use of menopausal hormone therapy may be considered for persistent vasomotor symptoms, issues related to quality of life, or for osteoporosis prevention in females at increased risk of fracture. Menopausal hormonal therapy does not need to be routinely discontinued in women &gt;60 years of age and may continue in females &gt;65 years of age after clinical evaluation and discussion of benefits and risks of treatment. Annual exams should be performed with a review of comorbidities; possible adjustments to safer lower-dose and/or route of administration should be discussed (ACOG 565 2013; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Laboratory changes: The use of estrogens and/or progestins may change the results of some laboratory tests (eg, coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, binding proteins). The dose, route, and the specific estrogen/progestin influences these changes.</p><p>• Osteoporosis use: In females with premature menopause, hormone therapy to prevent bone loss may be used unless otherwise contraindicated; therapy should be reassessed when the average age of menopause is reached. It is also an appropriate bone-active therapy for females with vasomotor symptoms who are &lt;60 years of age or within 10 years of menopause onset. Use may be considered for females at high risk of fractures who are not candidates for other osteoporosis therapies (NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Risks vs benefits: When used for the relief of menopausal symptoms or increased risk of bone fracture/loss, the benefit-risk of hormone therapy is most favorable if started in patients who have no contraindications to therapy, are &lt;60 years of age, within 10 years of menopause onset, have a favorable lipid profile, and do not have the factor V Leiden genotype or metabolic syndrome. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease should also be considered when evaluating therapy and route of administration (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]; NAMS 2017). <b> [US Boxed Warning]: Women taking estrogens (conjugated/equine) in combination with bazedoxifene should not take additional estrogen. Estrogens should be used for the shortest duration possible at the lowest effective dose consistent with treatment goals.</b> Females taking this combination should also not take progestins or additional estrogen agonists/antagonists. Patients should be reevaluated as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary. Available data related to treatment risks are from Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies, which evaluated oral CE 0.625 mg relative to placebo in postmenopausal females. Other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens were not studied; <b>outcomes should be assumed to be similar for other doses and other dosage forms of estrogens until comparable data becomes available.</b></p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Prior to therapy, baseline risk for breast cancer and CVD. During therapy, age appropriate breast and pelvic exams; blood pressure; unscheduled bleeding lasting &gt;6 months for endometrial pathology (sooner in patients who are obese, diabetic, or have a history of endometrial cancer); serum triglycerides (2 weeks after starting therapy in patients with baseline level &gt;200 mg/dL); TSH (6 to 12 weeks after starting oral therapy in patients taking thyroid replacement) (ES [Stuenkel 2015]).</p><p>Osteoporosis, prevention: Bone density measurement</p><p>Vasomotor symptoms: Efficacy beginning 1 to 3 months after starting therapy, then every 6 to 12 months as appropriate.
