The pancreas helps break down the bentiromide almost the same way it helps to break down food.</p><p>After bentiromide is broken down, a part of it appears in the urine. By measuring how much appears in the urine, your doctor can tell how well your pancreas is working.</p><p>How the test is done: Bentiromide is given by mouth as a single dose. After you take bentiromide, all of your urine is collected for the next six hours. The total amount is measured and a small sample is saved and examined. Your doctor may repeat the test after seven days.</p><p>Bentiromide was withdrawn from the U.S. market in October 1996.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using bentiromide</h2><p>In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. Also, other things may affect test results. For this test, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to bentiromide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Studies on bentiromide have been done only in older children and adult patients, and there is no specific information comparing use of bentiromide in children up to 6 years of age with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of bentiromide in the elderly with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.
