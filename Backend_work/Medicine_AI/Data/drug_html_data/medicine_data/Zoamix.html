Coccidiostat</span></p><h2>Active drug ingredient</h2><h2>Inactive ingredients</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For use in preparation of feeds for chickens and turkeys only. Livestock remedy - not for human use.</span></p><h2>Indications</h2><p class="First">Zoalene is to be fed continuously as an aid for the prevention and control of cecal and intestinal coccidiosis in chickens and intestinal coccidiosis in turkeys.</p><h2>Directions</h2><p class="First">It is suggested that a mixture of Zoamix and some feed ingredient be prepared prior to mixing in with the finished ration. This will insure thorough and even distribution in the feed.</p><h3>For chickens grown for meat purposes</h3><p class="First">Use 1 lb (454 g) of Zoamix per 2,000 lb (909 kg) of finished product to produce a feed containing 0.0125% zoalene. Zoamix should be thoroughly blended into the finished feed. Feed containing zoalene should be fed continuously as the only ration from the time chicks are placed in floor pens until they are slaughtered for meat.</p><h3>For replacement chickens</h3><p class="First">Feed containing zoalene can be used in a program to raise replacement birds. When used under conditions of exposure to coccidiosis, it will allow immunity to develop adequate to protect against losses due to the disease when the birds are placed on nonmedicated feed for egg laying purposes. The following chart outlines the type of feeding program to follow where complete formulated feed is the sole ration:</p><h3>For turkeys grown for meat purposes only</h3><p class="First">When turkey poults are reared in confinement and severe exposure to coccidiosis is usually a problem, use 1½ lb (681 g) of Zoamix per ton (2,000 lb) of feed to produce a finished feed containing 0.0187% zoalene. Under the usual conditions of rearing turkey poults, or when turkey poults are on range, use 1 lb (454 g) of Zoamix per 2,000 lbs (909 kg) of feed to produce a finished feed containing 0.0125% zoalene. The feed containing zoalene should be fed continuously until the birds are 14 to 16 weeks of age.</p><h2>Combinations with other drugs</h2><p class="First">Use only in accordance with the current New Animal Drug Regulation for zoalene, Section 558.680 of the Regulations promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.</p><h2>Cautions</h2><p class="First">Not to be fed to laying birds.<br/>
