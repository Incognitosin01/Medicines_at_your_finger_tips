However, side-effects were more frequent in the conventional regimen compared to the low-dose regimen, and results suggested that the low-dose regimen had higher patient satisfaction. The authors concluded that low-dose isotretinoin is most suitable for patients with moderate acne when considering tolerability, efficacy, and patient satisfaction <sup>[Lee 2011]</sup>. A prospective, non-comparative, open-label study in patients with moderate acne also found low-dose isotretinoin was effective (defined as complete or almost complete remission of acne lesions) with a low incidence of severe side effects <sup>[Amichai 2006]</sup>.</p><p>Based on the American Academy of Dermatology guidelines of care for acne vulgaris management, isotretinoin is an effective and recommended treatment for moderate degrees of treatment-resistant acne or acne that produces physical scarring or psychological distress.</p><h3>Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas</h3><p>Data from small clinical trials in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) suggests that isotretinoin (in combination with interferon alfa-2b) may be beneficial in the treatment of this condition <sup>[Duvic 2003]</sup>, <sup>[Knobler 1991]</sup>. Additional trials may be necessary to further define the role of isotretinoin in this setting.</p><h3>Squamous cell skin cancer (prevention in high-risk patients)</h3><p>Clinical experience suggests that oral retinoids may be useful for prevention of squamous cell skin cancer in high-risk patients. Acitretin may be the preferred agent in certain patient populations; however, due to a shortened half-life, isotretinoin may be preferred (with appropriate pregnancy testing and contraception) in females of reproductive potential <sup>[Otley 2006]</sup>. Additional data is necessary to further define the role of isotretinoin in this setting.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to isotretinoin or any component of the formulation; sensitivity to parabens (Zenatane only) or vitamin A; pregnancy.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Additional contraindications not in the US labeling: Breastfeeding, hepatic or renal insufficiency, hypervitaminosis A, excessive hyperlipidemia, concurrent tetracycline therapy.</p><p>Documentation of allergenic cross-reactivity for retinoids is limited.

There is an extremely high risk that severe birth defects will result if pregnancy occurs while taking any amount of isotretinoin, even for short periods of time. Potentially, any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining prenatally whether an exposed fetus has been affected.</p><p>Birth defects that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include abnormalities of the face, eyes, ears, skull, CNS, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. Cases of intelligence quotient (IQ) scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported. There is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, and premature births have been reported.</p><p>Documented external abnormalities include skull abnormality; ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye abnormalities (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia; cleft palate. Documented internal abnormalities include CNS abnormalities (including cerebral abnormalities, cerebellar malformation, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular abnormalities; thymus gland abnormality; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred with some of the abnormalities previously noted.</p><p>If pregnancy does occur during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.</p><p>Because of isotretinoin's teratogenicity and to minimize fetal exposure, isotretinoin is approved for marketing only under a special restricted distribution program approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This program is called iPLEDGE. Isotretinoin must only be prescribed by prescribers who are registered and activated with the iPLEDGE program. Isotretinoin must only be dispensed by a pharmacy registered and activated with iPLEDGE, and must only be dispensed to patients who are registered and meet all the requirements of iPLEDGE.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Auditory impairment: Hearing impairment, which can continue after therapy is discontinued, may occur. Discontinue therapy if hearing impairment or tinnitus develops.</p><p>• Bone mineral density loss: May decrease bone mineral density; osteoporosis, osteopenia, bone fractures, and delayed healing of bone fractures have been reported. Use caution in patients with a genetic predisposition for bone loss (eg, age-related osteoporosis, history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, other disorders of bone metabolism); including patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those on concomitant medications that may cause drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affect vitamin D metabolism (eg, systemic corticosteroids, anticonvulsants). Patients may be at increased risk when participating in activities with repetitive impact (such as sports) where the risk of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures and hip growth plate injuries in early and late adolescence are known.</p><p>• Dermatologic effects: Postmarketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), including fatalities, have been reported; monitor for severe skin reactions; discontinue use if severe skin reaction occurs.</p><p>• Growth effects: Skeletal hyperostosis and premature epiphyseal closure have also been reported with the use.</p><p>• Hematologic effects: Neutropenia and rare cases of agranulocytosis have been reported; discontinue if clinically significant decreases in white cell counts occur.</p><p>• Hepatic effects: Clinical hepatitis and mild to moderate elevated liver enzymes have been reported with use; liver enzymes may normalize with dosage reduction or with continued treatment. Discontinue therapy if hepatic enzymes do not normalize or if hepatitis is suspected.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylaxis and other types of allergic reactions, including cutaneous reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal), have been reported. Discontinue therapy if a serious allergic reaction occurs and institute appropriate medical management.</p><p>• Inflammatory bowel disease: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including regional ileitis, has been reported in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders; discontinue treatment immediately if abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or severe diarrhea occurs. Of note, a position statement from the American Academy of Dermatology states that based on currently available data, there is insufficient evidence to prove either an association or a causal relationship between IBD and isotretinoin use (AAD 2016).</p><p>• Musculoskeletal effects: Musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) have been reported; generally symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of therapy. Transient pain in the chest has occurred; symptoms generally cleared after discontinuation of therapy, but in some cases persisted. Rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity, has been reported (rarely).</p><p>• Ocular effects: Vision impairment, corneal opacities, decreased tolerance to contact lenses (due to dry eyes), and decreased night vision have been reported with use; discontinue therapy in patients experiencing visual difficulties. Warn patients to be cautious when driving or operating machinery at night.</p><p>• Pancreatitis: Acute pancreatitis may occur in patients with normal or elevated triglyceride levels; fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis (rare) has been reported; discontinue therapy if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled at an acceptable level or symptoms of pancreatitis occurs.</p><p>• Photosensitivity: Avoid prolonged exposure to UV rays or sunlight.</p><p>• Pseudotumor cerebri: Retinoids have been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), especially in children. Concurrent use of other drugs associated with this effect (eg, tetracyclines) may increase risk. Early signs and symptoms include papilledema, headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances; discontinue immediately and refer patient to a neurologist if papilledema occurs.</p><p>• Psychiatric effects: May cause depression, psychosis, mood disturbance, and rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors. All patients should be observed closely for symptoms of depression or suicidal thoughts. Discontinue therapy if depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression develops. Discontinuation of treatment alone may not be sufficient, further evaluation may be necessary. Use with extreme caution in patients with a history of psychiatric disorder.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus; impaired glucose control has been reported.</p><p>• Hypertriglyceridemia: Marked elevations of serum triglycerides have been reported; use with caution in patients with hypertriglyceridemia or those who may be at high risk (eg, patients with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, family history of or those with lipid metabolism disorder). The effects on triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and cholesterol have been reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Instruct patients to avoid or limit ethanol; may increase triglyceride levels if taken in excess.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Pregnancy: <b>[US Boxed Warnings]: Use of isotretinoin is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant. Birth defects (facial, eye, ear, skull, central nervous system, cardiovascular, thymus and parathyroid gland abnormalities) have been noted following isotretinoin exposure during pregnancy and the risk for severe birth defects is high, with any dose or even with short treatment duration. Low IQ scores have also been reported. The risk for spontaneous abortion and premature births is increased. Because of the high likelihood of teratogenic effects, all patients (male and female), prescribers, wholesalers, and dispensing pharmacists must register and be active in the iPLEDGE risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program; do not prescribe isotretinoin for patients who are or who are likely to become pregnant while using the drug. If pregnancy occurs during therapy, isotretinoin should be discontinued immediately and the patient referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist specializing in reproductive toxicity.</b></p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p>• Product interchange: Isotretinoin and tretinoin (which is also known as all-<i>trans</i> retinoic acid, or ATRA) may be confused, while both products may be used in cancer treatment, they are <b>not</b> interchangeable; verify product prior to dispensing and administration to prevent medication errors.</p><p>• Tartrazine: Some products may contain tartrazine (FD&amp;C yellow no. 5), which may cause allergic reactions, including bronchial asthma, in certain individuals. Allergy is frequently seen in patients who also have an aspirin hypersensitivity.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Blood donation: Patients should be instructed not to donate blood during therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation of therapy due to risk of donated blood being given to a pregnant patient.</p><p>• Experienced health care provider: This medication should only be prescribed by health care providers competent in treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne and experienced with the use of systemic retinoids.</p><p>• Long-term use: Safety of long-term use is not established and is not recommended; the effect on bone loss is unknown.</p><p>• REMS program: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Because of the high likelihood of teratogenic effects, all patients (male and female), prescribers, wholesalers, and dispensing pharmacists must register and be active in the iPLEDGE risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) management program; do not prescribe isotretinoin for patients who are or who are likely to become pregnant while using the drug.</b></p><p>• Skin resurfacing procedures: Avoid skin resurfacing procedures (eg, dermabrasion, laser) and wax epilation during therapy and for ≥6 months after discontinuation of isotretinoin due to the risk of scarring.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential and platelet count, baseline sedimentation rate, glucose, CPK; signs of depression, mood alteration, psychosis, aggression, severe skin reactions; changes in vision</p><p>Pregnancy test (for all patients of childbearing potential): Two negative tests with a sensitivity of ≥25 milliunits/mL prior to beginning therapy (the second performed ≥19 days after the first test and performed during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the start of therapy); monthly tests to rule out pregnancy prior to refilling prescription and 1 month after discontinuation.</p><p>Lipids: Prior to treatment and at weekly or biweekly intervals until response to treatment is established. Test should not be performed &lt;36 hours after consumption of ethanol.</p><p>Liver function tests: Prior to treatment and at weekly or biweekly intervals until response to treatment is established.</p><p>When used for oncology indications, monitor adherence.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p><b>[US Boxed Warning]: Isotretinoin must not be used by patients who may become pregnant.</b></p><p>Patients of childbearing potential must be able to comply with the guidelines of the iPLEDGE™ pregnancy prevention program. Females of childbearing potential must have 2 negative pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of ≥25 milliunits/mL prior to beginning therapy, and testing should continue monthly during therapy. Patients of childbearing potential should not become pregnant during therapy or for 1 month following discontinuation of isotretinoin. Upon discontinuation of treatment, patients of childbearing potential should have a pregnancy test after their last dose and again 1 month after their last dose.</p><p>All patients (male and female), must be registered in the iPLEDGE™ risk management program. Patients of childbearing potential must receive oral and written information reviewing the hazards of therapy and the effects that isotretinoin can have on a fetus. Therapy should not begin without 2 negative pregnancy tests ≥19 days apart. Two forms of contraception (a primary and secondary form as described in the iPLEDGE™ program materials) must be used simultaneously beginning 1 month prior to treatment, during treatment, and for 1 month after therapy is discontinued; limitations to their use must be explained. Micro-dosed progesterone products that do not contain an estrogen ("mini-pills") are not an acceptable form of contraception during isotretinoin treatment. Prescriptions should be written for no more than a 30-day supply, and pregnancy testing and counseling should be repeated monthly. During therapy, pregnancy tests must be conducted by a CLIA-certified laboratory. Prescriptions must be filled and picked up from the pharmacy within 7 days of specimen collection for pregnancy test for patients of childbearing potential. Prescriptions for patients of nonchildbearing potential (male and female) must be filled and picked up within 30 days of prescribing.</p><p>Any cases of accidental pregnancy should be reported to the iPLEDGE™ program or FDA MedWatch. All patients (male and female) must read and sign the informed consent material provided in the pregnancy prevention program.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Isotretinoin and its metabolites can be detected in fetal tissue following maternal use during pregnancy (Benifla 1995; Kraft 1989).</p><p>Use is contraindicated in pregnant women.<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Isotretinoin must not be used by patients who are pregnant. There is an extremely high risk that severe birth defects can result if pregnancy occurs while taking isotretinoin in any amount, even for short periods of time. Potentially, any fetus exposed during pregnancy can be affected. There are no accurate means of determining whether an exposed fetus has been affected. Birth defects that have been documented following isotretinoin exposure include abnormalities of the face, eyes, ears, skull, CNS, cardiovascular system, and thymus and parathyroid glands. Cases of intelligence quotient (IQ) scores less than 85 with or without other abnormalities have been reported. There is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, and premature births have been reported. Documented external abnormalities include skull abnormality; ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals); eye abnormalities (including microphthalmia); facial dysmorphia; cleft palate. Documented internal abnormalities include CNS abnormalities (including cerebral abnormalities, cerebellar malformation, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, cranial nerve deficit); cardiovascular abnormalities; thymus gland abnormality; parathyroid hormone deficiency. In some cases, death has occurred with some of the abnormalities previously noted.</b></p><p>If pregnancy does occur during treatment of a patient who is taking isotretinoin, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately and the patient should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.</p><p>Any pregnancies should be reported to the iPLEDGE™ program (www.ipledgeprogram.com or 866-495-0654) and the FDA through MedWatch (800-FDA-1088).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat pimples (acne).</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
