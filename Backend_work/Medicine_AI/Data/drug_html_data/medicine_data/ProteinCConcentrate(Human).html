APC is a serine protease which inactivates factors Va and VIIIa, limiting thrombotic formation. <i>In vitro </i>data also suggest inhibition of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAF-1) resulting in profibrinolytic activity, inhibition of macrophage production of tumor necrosis factor, blocking of leukocyte adhesion, and limitation of thrombin-induced inflammatory responses.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>V<sub>d</sub>: Median: 0.074L/kg (range: 0.044 to 0.165 L/kg) </p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Activated protein C (APC) inactivated by plasma protease inhibitors</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>30 minutes </p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Plasma: T<sub>max</sub>: 0.5 hours; range: 0.17 to 1.33 hours</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Median: 9.8 hours; range: 4.9 to 14.7 hours</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Severe congenital protein C deficiency:</b> Prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis and purpura fulminans in adults and pediatric patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>There are no contraindications listed in the manufacturer’s labeling.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p>Patient variables (including age, clinical condition, severity of protein C deficiency, and plasma levels of protein C) will influence dosing and duration of therapy.

Higher peak levels of protein C may be necessary in prophylactic therapy of patients at increased risk for thrombosis (eg, infection, trauma, surgical intervention). If a patient is switched to an oral anticoagulant, continue protein C replacement until stable anticoagulation is obtained. Initiate the oral anticoagulant at a low dose and adjust incrementally, rather than using a standard loading dose.</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance.

Other protocols have reported a daily dose of 100 units/kg/day with doses divided every 4 to 6 hours or as a continuous infusion (Veldman 2010) and others used a loading dose (100 units/kg/dose) followed by a continuous infusion (initial rate: 10 units/kg/hour) with titration of rate based upon protein C levels (target: 80 to 120 units/mL) (White 2000). Duration of therapy variable (1 to 24 days) (Veldman 2010); activated protein C levels and clinical response should be closely monitored.</p><p>Dosing based on placebo-controlled trials and retrospective reviews. In a phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study of 40 pediatric patients (median age: 2.3 years [range: 2.4 months to 16.1 years]), a dose of 100 to 150 units/kg/dose every 6 hours for 72 hours followed by 50 to 150 units/kg/dose every 12 hours until target symptom/sign resolution or treatment duration reaches 7 days was used; results showed dose-related increases in plasma activated protein C and resolution of coagulation imbalances (de Kleijn 2003). A retrospective review of 94 pediatric patients (newborn to 18 years) reported a median dose of 100 units/kg/day divided every 4 to 6 hours (daily dose range: 28 to 375 units/kg/day) in the majority of patients (78 of the 94 patients); the remaining patients received an initial bolus with the remainder of daily dose administered as a continuous IV infusion (dosing specifics were not provided); median treatment duration of 33 hours (range: 1 to 645 hours) (Veldman 2010). An open-label, prospective study of 36 patients (3 months to 72 years) reported an initial dose of 100 units/kg followed by a continuous IV infusion with an initial rate of 10 units/kg/hour adjusted daily to maintain plasma protein C concentration 80 to 120 units/mL (White 2000).</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance.

Reconstitute 500 units vial with 5 mL and 1000 units vial with 10 mL sterile water for injection (resultant concentration; 100 units/mL). Gently swirl; ensure powder is completely dissolved. Use provided filter needle to withdraw solution from vial; remove filter needle prior to administration. </p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IV: Administer by intravenous injection at a rate not to exceed 2 mL/minute.
