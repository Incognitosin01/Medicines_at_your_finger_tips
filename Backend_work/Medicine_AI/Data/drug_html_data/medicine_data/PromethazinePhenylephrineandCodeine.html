Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution.  Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.  Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, including codeine, one of the active ingredients in Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution.  Codeine produces dose-related respiratory depression by directly acting on the brain stem respiratory center that controls respiratory rhythm and may produce irregular and periodic breathing.  Codeine is subject to variability in metabolism based upon CYP2D6 genotype, which can lead to an increased exposure to the active metabolite morphine <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.  Promethazine exerts a depressant effect on the respiratory center that is independent of and additive to that of other respiratory depressants, including codeine <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.  Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death.  Management of respiratory depression includes discontinuation of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution, close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists (e.g., naloxone), depending on the patient’s clinical status <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>.  Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy, when Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution is used concomitantly with other drugs that may cause respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]</span>, in patients with chronic pulmonary disease or decreased respiratory reserve, and in patients with altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance (e.g., elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>. </p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution is essential <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.  Monitor patients closely, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy or when used in patients at higher risk. </p><p>Overdose of codeine in adults has been associated with fatal respiratory depression, and the use of codeine in children younger than 12 years of age has been associated with fatal respiratory depression when used as recommended <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.  Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death.</p><h3>Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Other Risk Factors for Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Children</h3><p class="First">Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine.  Codeine is subject to variability in metabolism based upon CYP2D6 genotype (described below), which can lead to an increased exposure to the active metabolite morphine.  Based upon post-marketing reports, children younger than 12 years old appear to be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine, particularly if there are risk factors for respiratory depression.  For example, many reported cases of death occurred in the post-operative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine.  Furthermore, children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine for post-tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to its respiratory depressant effect.  Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution is contraindicated in all children younger than 12 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</li>
<li>Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution is contraindicated for post-operative management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</li>
<li>Avoid the use of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span></li>
<li>Healthcare providers should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of morphine overdose <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Overdosage (10)]</span>.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Lactation</span></p><p>At least one death was reported in a nursing infant who was exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because the mother was an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">CYP2D6 Genetic Variability: Ultra-Rapid Metabolizers</span></p><p>Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype (e.g., gene duplications denoted as *1/*1xN or *1/*2xN).  The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 1 to 10% for Whites (European, North American), 3 to 4% for Blacks (African Americans), 1 to 2% for East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), and may be greater than 10% in certain ethnic groups (i.e., Oceanian, Northern African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican).  These individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people.  This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels.  Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression or experience signs of overdose (such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing) <span class="Italics">[<span class="Italics">see</span> Overdosage (10)]</span>.

Because of these risks, avoid use of opioid cough medications in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.4)]</span>. </p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone.  Because of similar pharmacologic properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with concomitant use of opioid cough medications and benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation if Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution is used with benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other CNS depressants <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First">Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus <span class="Italics">[</span><span class="Italics">s</span><span class="Italics">ee Contraindications (4)]</span>.  The use of codeine in Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions. </p><p>The concurrent use of anticholinergics with Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution may produce paralytic ileus <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.9)]</span>. </p><p>The codeine in Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution may result in constipation or obstructive bowel disease, especially in patients with underlying intestinal motility disorders.  Use with caution in patients with underlying intestinal motility disorders. </p><p>The codeine in Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, resulting in an increase in biliary tract pressure.  Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.22)]</span>.  Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms. </p><p>Administration of promethazine has been associated with reported cholestatic jaundice.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Head Injury, Impaired Consciousness, Increased Intracranial Pressure, or Brain Tumors</h3><p class="First">Avoid the use of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure.  In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure.  Furthermore, opioids produce adverse reactions that may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.</p><h3>Cardiovascular and Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">The phenylephrine contained in Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution can produce cardiovascular and central nervous system effects in some patients such as, insomnia, dizziness, weakness, tremor, transient elevations in blood pressure, or arrhythmias.  Central nervous system stimulation with convulsions or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension has also been reported.  Phenylephrine can cause a decrease in cardiac output.  In patients with hypertension or with peripheral vascular insufficiency, phenylephrine may cause ischemia, increasing the risk of gangrene or thrombosis of compromised vascular beds.  Therefore, Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution is contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension, coronary artery disease, or peripheral vascular insufficiency <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>, and should be used with caution in patients with other cardiovascular disorders, including patients with arteriosclerosis, elderly individuals, or patients with poor cerebral circulation.</p><h3>Risk of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</h3><p class="First">A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with promethazine HCl alone or in combination with antipsychotic drugs.  Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias).</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated.  In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS).  Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.</p><p>The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of promethazine HCl, antipsychotic drugs, if any, and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available.  There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.</p><p>Since recurrences of NMS have been reported with phenothiazines, avoid use of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution in patients with a history consistent with NMS.</p><h3>Risk of Paradoxical Reactions, including Dystonias</h3><p class="First">Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution contains promethazine, a phenothiazine.  Phenothiazines are associated with dystonic reactions, particularly in pediatric patients who have an acute illness associated with dehydration.  Paradoxical reactions, including dystonia, torticollis, tongue protrusion, hyperexcitability, and abnormal movements have been reported in patients following a single administration of promethazine.  Discontinue Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution if a paradoxical reaction occurs.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</h3><p class="First">The codeine and promethazine in Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures.  Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution therapy.</p><h3>Co-administration with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)</h3><p class="First">Concurrent use of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution is contraindicated in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or within 14 days of stopping such therapy <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.  MAOIs may potentiate the effects of morphine, codeine’s active metabolite, including respiratory depression, coma, and confusion MAOIs.  The cardiac pressor response may be potentiated and acute hypertensive crisis may occur when phenylephrine containing preparations are used with prior administration of MAOIs. <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.6)]</span></p><h3>Bone-Marrow Depression</h3><p class="First">Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients with bone-marrow depression.  Leukopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported, usually when promethazine has been used in association with other known marrow-toxic agents.</p><h3>Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients.  There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. </span> Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution.</p><p>In patients with circulatory shock, Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.  Avoid the use of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution in patients with circulatory shock.</p><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution is not recommended for use in pregnant women.  Prolonged use of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate.  Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.  Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly.  Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span></p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.  Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure.  If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible.  If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids.  Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers.  Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency.  The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">Because opioid agonists may increase biliary tract pressure, with resultant increase in plasma amylase or lipase levels, determination of these enzyme levels may be unreliable for 24 hours after administration of a dose of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution.</p><p>The following laboratory tests may be affected in patients who are receiving promethazine:</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Tests</span>: Diagnostic pregnancy tests based on immunological reactions between HCG and anti-HCG may result in false-negative or false-positive interpretations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Glucose Tolerance Test</span>: An increase in blood glucose has been reported in patients receiving promethazine.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:</p><ul class="Disc">

There are published studies and cases that have reported excessive sedation, respiratory depression and death (in one infant) in infants exposed to codeine via breast milk.  Women who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine achieve higher than expected serum levels of morphine, potentially leading to higher levels of morphine in breast milk that can be dangerous in their breastfed infants.  In women with normal codeine metabolism (normal CYP2D6 activity), the amount of codeine secreted into human milk is low and dose-dependent.  There is no information on the effects of the codeine on milk production. </p><p><span class="Italics">Promethazine</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of promethazine in human milk.  However, direct oral administration of promethazine has been associated with respiratory depression, including fatalities, in pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.

<li>Avoid the use of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.6)].</span></li>
</ul><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies have not been conducted with Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution in geriatric populations. </p><p>Use caution when considering the use of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution in patients 65 years of age or older.  Elderly patients may have increased sensitivity to codeine; greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function; or concomitant disease or other drug therapy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.  </p><p>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, including Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution.  Respiratory depression has occurred after large initial doses of opioids were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.10)]</span>. </p><p>Codeine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

Codeine pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with renal failure.  Clearance may be decreased and the metabolites may accumulate to much higher plasma levels in patients with renal failure as compared to patients with normal renal function.  Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients with severe impairment of renal function, and patients should be monitored closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment so the pharmacokinetics of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution in this patient population are unknown.  Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients with impairment of hepatic function, and patients should be monitored closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution contains codeine, a Schedule V controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Codeine</span></p><p>Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution contains codeine, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including morphine and codeine.  Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic and antitussive products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. </p><p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</p><p>“Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders.  Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider(s).  “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction.  Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance.  Health care providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks Specific to Abuse of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution</span></p><p>Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution is for oral use only.

Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine).  Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome: restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis.  Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Codeine</span></p><p>Acute overdose with codeine is characterized by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, hypotension, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death.</p><p>Codeine may cause miosis, even in total darkness.

Bradycardia may be seen early in phenylephrine overdosage through stimulation of baroreceptors.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment of Overdose</span></p><p>Treatment of overdosage is driven by the overall clinical presentation, and consists of discontinuation of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution together with institution of appropriate therapy.  Give primary attention to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent and protected airway and the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation.  Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated.  Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.  Gastric emptying may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone and nalmefene, are specific antidotes for respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose.  For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to codeine overdose, administer an opioid antagonist.  An antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory depression.  Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of codeine in Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished.  If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.  The respiratory depressant effects of promethazine are not reversed by opioid antagonists, such as naloxone. </p><p>Because of the potential for promethazine to reverse epinephrine’s vasopressor effect, epinephrine should NOT be used to treat hypotension associated with promethazine overdose.</p><p>Hemodialysis is not routinely used to enhance the elimination of codeine or promethazine from the body. </p><p>Adrenergic receptor blocking agents (beta-blockers), such as propranolol, may be used for the treatment of cardiac toxicity due to phenylephrine.</p><h2>Promethazine Phenylephrine and Codeine Description</h2><p class="First">Promethazine HCl, phenylephrine HCl and codeine phosphate oral solution, USP contains codeine, an opioid agonist; promethazine, a phenothiazine; and phenylephrine, an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist.</p><p>Each 5 mL of promethazine HCl, phenylephrine HCl and codeine phosphate oral solution, USP contains 10 mg of codeine phosphate, USP, 6.25 mg of promethazine hydrochloride, USP and 5 mg of phenylephrine hydrochloride, USP for oral administration.</p><p>Promethazine HCl, phenylephrine HCl and codeine phosphate oral solution, USP contains Alcohol 7.15% v/v.</p><p>Promethazine HCl, phenylephrine HCl and codeine phosphate oral solution, USP also contains the following inactive ingredients: anhydrous citric acid, ascorbic acid, edetate disodium, glycerin, methylparaben, natural &amp; artificial citrus flavor FN-7176, purified water, saccharin sodium, sodium benzoate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium citrate, and sucrose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Codeine Phosphate</span></p><p>The chemical name for codeine phosphate is 7,8-Didehydro-4, 5α-epoxy-3-methoxy-17-methylmorphinan-6α-ol phosphate (1:1) (salt) hemihydrate.

The analgesic and antitussive properties of codeine have been speculated to come from its conversion to morphine.  The precise mechanism of action of codeine and other opiates is not known; however, codeine is believed to act centrally on the cough center.  In excessive doses, codeine will depress respiration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Promethazine</span></p><p>Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative, which differs structurally from the antipsychotic phenothiazines by the presence of a branched side chain and no ring substitution.  Promethazine possesses antihistamine (H<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor antagonist), antiemetic, sedative, and anticholinergic effects.  It prevents released histamine from dilating capillaries and causing edema of the respiratory mucosa.</p><p><span class="Bold">Phenylephrine</span></p><p>Phenylephrine is a sympathomimetic amine that exerts a decongestant action on the nasal mucosa via alpha adrenergic receptor activity.  It has the potential for excitatory side effects.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Codeine</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on the Central Nervous System</span></p><p>Codeine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers.  The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.</p><p>Codeine causes miosis, even in total darkness.  Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings).  Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span></p><p>Codeine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum.  Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased.  Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation.  Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span></p><p>Codeine produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope.  Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on the Endocrine System</span></p><p>Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.  They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility.  The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>. </p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on the Immune System</span></p><p>Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and animal models.

Following oral administration or topical application of phenylephrine to the mucosa, constriction of blood vessels in the nasal mucosa relieves nasal congestion associated with allergy or head colds.  Following oral administration, nasal decongestion may occur within 15 or 20 minutes and may persist for up to 4 hours.</p><p>Phenylephrine increases resistance and, to a lesser extent, decreases capacitance of blood vessels.  Total peripheral resistance is increased, resulting in increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure.  Pulmonary arterial pressure is usually increased, and renal blood flow is usually decreased.  Local vasoconstriction and hemostasis occur following topical application or infiltration of phenylephrine into tissues.</p><p>The main effect of phenylephrine on the heart is bradycardia; it produces a positive inotropic effect on the myocardium in doses greater than those usually used therapeutically.  Rarely, the drug may increase the irritability of the heart, causing arrhythmias.  Cardiac output is decreased slightly.  Phenylephrine increases the work of the heart by increasing peripheral arterial resistance.  Phenylephrine has a mild central stimulant effect <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Codeine is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with maximum plasma concentration occurring 60 minutes post administration.

UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 and 2B4 are the major enzymes mediating glucuronidation of codeine to C6G.  Cytochrome P450 2D6 is the major enzyme responsible for conversion of codeine to morphine and P450 3A4 is the major enzyme mediating conversion of codeine to norcodeine.  Morphine and norcodeine are further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid.  The glucuronide metabolites of morphine are morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G).  Morphine and its M6 glucuronide conjugate are pharmacologically active.  Whether C6G has pharmacological activity is unknown.  Norcodeine and M3 glucuronide conjugate of morphine are generally not considered to be pharmacologically active.</p><p>Promethazine is metabolized by the liver to a variety of inactive metabolites such as sulfoxides of promethazine, N-demethylpromethazine and other glucuronides.</p><p>Phenylephrine is metabolized primarily by monoamine oxidase and sulfotransferase in the intestinal wall and liver.
