<html><head></head><body><h1>Vesanoid (Oral)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> tretinoin (TRET-i-noin) (Oral route)</p><p>Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) can have severe adverse reactions to tretinoin including retinoic acid-APL (RA-APL) syndrome characterized by fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress, weight gain, radiographic pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and pericardial effusions, edema, and hepatic, renal, and multi-organ failure. High-dose steroids given at the first suspicion of the RA-APL syndrome appear to reduce morbidity and mortality. Patients can also develop rapidly evolving leukocytosis during therapy which can lead to an increased risk of life-threatening complications. There is a high risk that a severely deformed infant will result if tretinoin is administered during pregnancy. Pregnancy testing is necessary prior to initiation of treatment in women of childbearing potential and the patient must be instructed in the need to use two reliable forms of contraception simultaneously during therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation of therapy. Pregnancy testing and contraception counseling should be repeated monthly throughout the period of tretinoin treatment .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>
