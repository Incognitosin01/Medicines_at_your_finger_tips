Azithromycin for oral suspension USP is supplied to provide 200 mg/5 mL suspension in bottles.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Azithromycin for oral suspension is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to azithromycin, erythromycin, any macrolide or ketolide drug.</p><h3>Hepatic Dysfunction</h3><p class="First">Azithromycin for oral suspension is contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of azithromycin.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Serious allergic reactions, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and dermatologic reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients on azithromycin therapy. <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1)]</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Fatalities have been reported. Cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have also been reported. Despite initially successful symptomatic treatment of the allergic symptoms, when symptomatic therapy was discontinued, the allergic symptoms recurred soon thereafter in some patients without further azithromycin exposure. These patients required prolonged periods of observation and symptomatic treatment. The relationship of these episodes to the long tissue half-life of azithromycin and subsequent prolonged exposure to antigen is presently unknown</span>.</p><p>If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Physicians should be aware that allergic symptoms may reappear when symptomatic therapy has been discontinued.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Abnormal liver function, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported, some of which have resulted in death. Discontinue azithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur.</p><h3>Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis(IHPS)</h3><p class="First">Following the use of azithromycin in neonates (treatment up to 42 days of life), IHPS has been reported. Direct parents and caregivers to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs.</p><h3>QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Prolonged cardiac repolarization and QT interval, imparting a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia and torsades de pointes, have been seen with treatment with macrolides, including azithromycin. Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving azithromycin. Providers should consider the risk of QT prolongation which can be fatal when weighing the risks and benefits of azithromycin for at-risk groups including:</p><p>Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea (CDAD)</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>-associated diarrhea has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including azithromycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis</h3><p class="First">Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of myasthenic syndrome have been reported in patients receiving azithromycin therapy.</p><h3>Use in Sexually Transmitted Infections</h3><p class="First">Azithromycin, at the recommended dose, should not be relied upon to treat syphilis. Antibacterial agents used to treat non-gonococcal urethritis may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis. All patients with sexually transmitted urethritis or cervicitis should have a serologic test for syphilis and appropriate testing for gonorrhea performed at the time of diagnosis. Appropriate antibacterial therapy and follow-up tests for these diseases should be initiated if infection is confirmed.</p><h3>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing azithromycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>In clinical trials, most of the reported side effects were mild to moderate in severity and were reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. Potentially serious adverse reactions of angioedema and cholestatic jaundice were reported. Approximately 0.7% of the patients (adults and pediatric patients) from the 5-day multiple-dose clinical trials discontinued azithromycin therapy because of treatment-related adverse reactions. In adults given 500 mg/day for 3 days, the discontinuation rate due to treatment-related adverse reactions was 0.6%. In clinical trials in pediatric patients given 30 mg/kg, either as a single dose or over 3 days, discontinuation from the trials due to treatment-related adverse reactions was approximately 1%. Most of the adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were related to the gastrointestinal tract, e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span></p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of azithromycin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Adverse reactions reported with azithromycin during the postmarketing period in adult and/or pediatric patients for which a causal relationship may not be established include:</p><p><span class="Italics">Allergic:</span> Arthralgia, edema, urticaria, and angioedema.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> Arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia and hypotension. There have been reports of QT prolongation and <span class="Italics">torsades de pointes</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal</span>: Anorexia, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, vomiting/diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis, oral candidiasis, pyloric stenosis, and reports of tongue discoloration.</p><p><span class="Italics">General</span>: Asthenia, paresthesia, fatigue, malaise, and anaphylaxis</p><p><span class="Italics">Genitourinary</span>: Interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure and vaginitis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hematopoietic</span>: Thrombocytopenia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Liver/Biliary</span>: Abnormal liver function, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System</span>: Convulsions, dizziness/vertigo, headache, somnolence, hyperactivity, nervousness, agitation, and syncope.</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric:</span> Aggressive reaction and anxiety.</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin/Appendages</span>: Pruritus serious skin reactions including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS.</p><p><span class="Italics">Special Senses</span>: Hearing disturbances including hearing loss, deafness and/or tinnitus, and reports of taste/smell perversion and/or loss.</p><h3>Laboratory Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Clinically significant abnormalities (irrespective of drug relationship) occurring during the clinical trials were reported as follows: with an incidence of greater than 1%: decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and blood glucose; elevated serum creatine phosphokinase, potassium, ALT, GGT, AST, BUN, creatinine, blood glucose, platelet count, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils; with an incidence of less than 1%: leukopenia, neutropenia, decreased sodium, potassium, platelet count, elevated monocytes, basophils, bicarbonate, serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, LDH, and phosphate. The majority of subjects with elevated serum creatinine also had abnormal values at baseline. When follow-up was provided, changes in laboratory tests appeared to be reversible.</p><p>In multiple-dose clinical trials involving more than 5000 patients, four patients discontinued therapy because of treatment-related liver enzyme abnormalities and one because of a renal function abnormality.</p><p class="First">One, Three, and Five-Day Regimens</p><p>Laboratory data collected from comparative clinical trials employing two 3-day regimens (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg in divided doses over 3 days), or two 5-day regimens (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg in divided doses over 5 days) were similar for regimens of azithromycin and all comparators combined, with most clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurring at incidences of 1-5%. Laboratory data for patients receiving 30 mg/kg as a single dose were collected in one single center trial. In that trial, an absolute neutrophil count between 500-1500 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> was observed in 10/64 patients receiving 30 mg/kg as a single dose, 9/62 patients receiving 30 mg/kg given over 3 days, and 8/63 comparator patients. No patient had an absolute neutrophil count &lt;500 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>.</p><p>In multiple-dose clinical trials involving approximately 4700 pediatric patients, no patients discontinued therapy because of treatment-related laboratory abnormalities.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Nelfinavir</h3><p class="First">Co-administration of nelfinavir at steady-state with a single oral dose of azithromycin resulted in increased azithromycin serum concentrations. Although a dose adjustment of azithromycin is not recommended when administered in combination with nelfinavir, close monitoring for known adverse reactions of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted. <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span></p><h3>Warfarin</h3><p class="First">Spontaneous postmarketing reports suggest that concomitant administration of azithromycin may potentiate the effects of oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, although the prothrombin time was not affected in the dedicated drug interaction study with azithromycin and warfarin. Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving azithromycin and oral anticoagulants concomitantly.</p><h3>Potential Drug-Drug Interaction with Macrolides</h3><p class="First">Interactions with digoxin, colchicine or phenytoin have not been reported in clinical trials with azithromycin. No specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate potential drug-drug interaction. However, drug interactions have been observed with other macrolide products. Until further data are developed regarding drug interactions when digoxin or phenytoin are used with azithromycin careful monitoring of patients is advised.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available data from published literature and postmarketing experience over several decades with azithromycin use in pregnant women have not identified any drug-associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Developmental toxicity studies with azithromycin in rats, mice, and rabbits showed no drug-induced fetal malformations at doses up to 4, 2, and 2 times, respectively, an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area. Decreased viability and delayed development were observed in the offspring of pregnant rats administered azithromycin from day 6 of pregnancy through weaning at a dose equivalent to 4 times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Available data from published observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades do not suggest an increased risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with azithromycin use in pregnant women. Limitations of these data include the lack of randomization and inability to control for confounders such as underlying maternal disease and maternal use of concomitant medications.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Azithromycin administered during the period of organogenesis did not cause fetal malformations in rats and mice at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (moderately maternally toxic). Based on body surface area, this dose is approximately 4 (rats) and 2 (mice) times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg. In rabbits administered azithromycin at oral doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg/day during organogenesis, reduced maternal body weight and food consumption were observed in all groups; no evidence of fetotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed at these doses, the highest of which is estimated to be 2 times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area.</p><p>In a pre-and postnatal development study, azithromycin was administered orally to pregnant rats from day 6 of pregnancy until weaning at doses of 50 or 200 mg/kg/day. Maternal toxicity (reduced food consumption and body weight gain; increased stress at parturition) was observed at the higher dose. Effects in the offspring were noted at 200 mg/kg/day during the postnatal development period (decreased viability, delayed developmental landmarks). These effects were not observed in a pre-and postnatal rat study when up to 200 mg/kg/day of azithromycin was given orally beginning on day 15 of pregnancy until weaning.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Azithromycin is present in human milk <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Non-serious adverse reactions have been reported in breastfed infants after maternal administration of azithromycin <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</span>. There are no available data on the effects of azithromycin on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for azithromycin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azithromycin or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Advise women to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea, vomiting, or rash.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>Azithromycin breastmilk concentrations were measured in 20 women after receiving a single 2 g oral dose of azithromycin during labor. Breastmilk samples collected on days 3 and 6 postpartum as well as 2 and 4 weeks postpartum revealed the presence of azithromycin in breastmilk up to 4 weeks after dosing.

Azithromycin has the chemical name (2R,3S,4R,5R,8R,10R,11R,12S,13S,14R)-13-[(2,6-dideoxy-3-C-methyl-3-O-methyl-α-L-ribo-hexopyranosyl)oxy]-2-ethyl-3,4,10-trihydroxy-3,5,6,8,10,12,14-heptamethyl-11-[[3,4,6-trideoxy-3-(dimethylamino)-β-D-xylo-hexopyranosyl]oxy]-1-oxa-6-azacyclopentadecan-15-one monohydrate. Azithromycin is derived from erythromycin; however, it differs chemically from erythromycin in that a methyl-substituted nitrogen atom is incorporated into the lactone ring. Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">38</span>H<span class="Sub">72</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">12</span>∙H<span class="Sub">2</span>O, and its molecular weight is 767.00.

After constitution, each 5 mL of suspension contains 200 mg of azithromycin, USP. The dry powder before constitution is off-white to pinkish in color. The suspension after constitution is pink to red in color.</p><h2>Azithromycin Oral Suspension - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug. <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)]</span></p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Based on animal models of infection, the antibacterial activity of azithromycin appears to correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) for certain pathogens (<span class="Italics">S. pneumoniae</span> and <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span>). The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with azithromycin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine (1000 mg) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin (500 mg, 1000 mg, and 1500 mg once daily). Co-administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. In comparison to chloroquine alone, the maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) increases in QTcF were 5 (10) ms, 7 (12) ms and 9 (14) ms with the co-administration of 500 mg, 1000 mg and 1500 mg azithromycin, respectively.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Following oral administration of a single 500 mg dose (two 250 mg tablets) to 36 fasted healthy male volunteers, the mean (SD) pharmacokinetic parameters were AUC<span class="Sub">0-72</span>=4.3 (1.2) mcg∙hr/mL; C<span class="Sub">max</span>=0.5 (0.2) mcg/mL; T<span class="Sub">max</span> =2.2 (0.9) hours.

Due to limited serum samples on day 2 (3 day regimen) and days 2 to 4 (5 day regimen), the serum concentration-time profile of each subject was fit to a 3-compartment model and the AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> for the fitted concentration profile was comparable between the 5 day and 3 day regimens.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">3-Day Regimen</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">5-Day Regimen</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetic Parameter [mean (SD)]</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Day 1</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Day 3</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Day 1</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Day 5</span></p><p class="First">C<span class="Sub">max</span> (serum, mcg/mL)</p><p class="First">0.44 (0.22)</p><p class="First">0.54 (0.25)</p><p class="First">0.43 (0.20)</p><p class="First">0.24 (0.06)</p><p class="First">Serum AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> (mcg∙hr/mL)</p><p class="First">17.4 (6.2)*</p><p class="First">14.9 (3.1)*</p><p class="First">Serum T<span class="Sub">½</span></p><p class="First">71.8 hr</p><p class="First">68.9 hr</p><p class="First">*Total AUC for the entire 3-day and 5 day regimens.</p><p class="First">The absolute bioavailability of azithromycin 250 mg capsules is 38%.</p><p>In a two-way crossover study in which 12 healthy subjects received a single 500 mg dose of azithromycin (two 250 mg tablets) with or without a high fat meal, food was shown to increase C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 23% but had no effect on AUC.</p><p>When Azithromycin Oral Suspension was administered with food to 28 adult healthy male subjects, C<span class="Sub">max</span> increased by 56% and AUC was unchanged.</p><p class="First">The serum protein binding of azithromycin is variable in the concentration range approximating human exposure, decreasing from 51% at 0.02 mcg/mL to 7% at 2 mcg/mL.</p><p>The antibacterial activity of azithromycin is pH related and appears to be reduced with decreasing pH, However, the extensive distribution of drug to tissues may be relevant to clinical activity.</p><p>Azithromycin has been shown to penetrate into human tissues, including skin, lung, tonsil, and cervix. Extensive tissue distribution was confirmed by examination of additional tissues and fluids (bone, ejaculum, prostate, ovary, uterus, salpinx, stomach, liver, and gallbladder).

The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly as unchanged drug, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></span></p><p>Azithromycin acts by binding to the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis and impeding the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Resistance</span></span></p><p>Azithromycin demonstrates cross resistance with erythromycin.

Azithromycin has shown no mutagenic potential in standard laboratory tests: mouse lymphoma assay, human lymphocyte clastogenic assay, and mouse bone marrow clastogenic assay. In fertility studies conducted in male and female rats, oral administration of azithromycin for 64 to 66 days (males) or 15 days (females) prior to and during cohabitation resulted in decreased pregnancy rate at 20 and 30 mg/kg/day when both males and females were treated with azithromycin. This minimal effect on pregnancy rate (approximately 12% reduction compared to concurrent controls) did not become more pronounced when the dose was increased from 20 to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.4 to 0.6 times the adult daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area) and it was not observed when only one animal in the mated pair was treated. There were no effects on any other reproductive parameters, and there were no effects on fertility at 10 mg/kg/day. The relevance of these findings to patients being treated with azithromycin at the doses and durations recommended in the prescribing information is uncertain.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Phospholipidosis (intracellular phospholipid accumulation) has been observed in some tissues of mice, rats, and dogs given multiple doses of azithromycin. It has been demonstrated in numerous organ systems (e.g., eye, dorsal root ganglia, liver, gallbladder, kidney, spleen, and/or pancreas) in dogs and rats treated with azithromycin at doses which, expressed on the basis of body surface area, are similar to or less than the highest recommended adult human dose. This effect has been shown to be reversible after cessation of azithromycin treatment. Based on the pharmacokinetic data, phospholipidosis has been seen in the rat (50 mg/kg/day dose) at the observed maximal plasma concentration of 1.3 mcg/mL (1.6 times the observed C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 0.821 mcg/mL at the adult dose of 2 g). Similarly, it has been shown in the dog (10 mg/kg/day dose) at the observed maximal serum concentration of 1 mcg/mL (1.2 times the observed C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 0.821 mcg/mL at the adult dose of 2 g). Phospholipidosis was also observed in neonatal rats dosed for 18 days at 30 mg/kg/day, which is less than the pediatric dose of 60 mg/kg based on the surface area. It was not observed in neonatal rats treated for 10 days at 40 mg/kg/day with mean maximal serum concentrations of 1.86 mcg/mL, approximately 1.5 times the C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 1.27 mcg/mL at the pediatric dose. Phospholipidosis has been observed in neonatal dogs (10 mg/kg/day) at maximum mean whole blood concentrations of 3.54 mcg/mL, approximately 3 times the pediatric dose C<span class="Sub">max</span>. The significance of these findings for animals and for humans is unknown.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Adult Patients</h3><p class="First">In a randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB), azithromycin (500 mg once daily for 3 days) was compared with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days).

Storage: Store dry powder below 30°C (86°F). Store constituted suspension between 5° to 30°C (41° to 86°F) and discard when full dosing is completed.</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">General Patient Counseling</p><p>Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).</p><p>Azithromycin for oral suspension can be taken with or without food.</p><p>Patients should also be cautioned not to take aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids and azithromycin simultaneously.</p><p>The patient should be directed to discontinue azithromycin immediately and contact a physician if any signs of an allergic reaction occur.</p><p>Direct parents or caregivers to contact their physician if vomiting and irritability with feeding occurs in the infant.</p><p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including azithromycin for oral suspension should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When azithromycin for oral suspension is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of the therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by azithromycin for oral suspension or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><p><span class="Bold">See FDA-approved Patient Labeling</span></p><p>Distributed by:<br/>
