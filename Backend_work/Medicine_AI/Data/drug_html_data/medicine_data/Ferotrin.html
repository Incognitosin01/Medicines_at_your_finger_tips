</ul><h2>Ferotrin Description</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">EACH CAPSULE CONTAINS:</span></p><p>Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid).....75 mg.</p><p>Folic Acid.....500 mcg.</p><p>Vitamin B-12 (Cyanocobalamin).....15 mcg.</p><p>Iron (Ferrous Fumarate).....110 mg.</p><p>Liver Stomach Concentrate (containing Intrinsic Factor).....240 mg.</p><p>Inactive Ingredients: D&amp;C Red #28, Dicalcium Phospate, FD&amp;C Blue #1, FD&amp;C Green # 3, FD&amp;C Red # 40, Gelatin, Magnesium Stearate, Pharmaceutical Glaze, and Titanium Dioxide.</p><h2>Ferotrin - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vitamin B-12 with Intrinsic Factor</span> - When secretion of intrinsic factor in gastric juice</p><p>is inadequate or absent (e.g., in Addisonian pernicious anemia or after</p><p>gastrectomy), vitamin B-12 in physiologic doses is absorbed poorly, if at all. The</p><p>resulting deficiency of vitamin B-12 leads to the clinical manifestations of</p><p>pernicious anemia. Similar megaloblastic anemias may develop in fish tapeworm</p><p>(Diphyllobothrium latum) infection or after a surgically created small-bowel blind</p><p>loop; in these situations, treatment requires freeing the host of the parasites or</p><p>bacteria that appear to compete for the available vitamin B-12. Strict</p><p>vegetarianism and malabsorption syndromes may also lead to vitamin B-12</p><p>deficiency. In the latter case, parenteral therapy, or oral therapy with so-called</p><p>massive doses of vitamin B-12, may be necessary for adequate treatment of the</p><p>patient.</p><p>Potency of intrinsic factor concentrates is determined physiologically, ie., by their</p><p>use in patients with pernicious anemia. The liver-stomach concentrate with</p><p>intrinsic factor and the vitamin B-12 contained in two Ferotrin Capsules provide 1</p><p>1/2 times the minimum amount of therapeutic agent, which, when given daily in an</p><p>uncomplicated case of pernicious anemia, will produce a satisfactory reticulocyte</p><p>response and relief of anemia and symptoms.</p><p>Concentrates of intrinsic factor derived from hog gastric, pyloric and duodenal</p><p>mucosa have been used successfully in patients who lack intrinsic factor. For</p><p>example, Fouts et al maintained patients with pernicious anemia in clinical</p><p>remission with oral therapy (liver extracts or intrinsic factor concentrate with vitamin</p><p>B-12) for as long as 29 years.</p><p>After total gastrectomy, Ficarra found multifactor preparations taken orally to be</p><p>"just as effective in maintaining blood levels as any medication that has to be</p><p>administered parenterally." His study was based on 24 patients who had survived</p><p>for five years after total gastrectomy for cancer and who had been taking two</p><p>Ferotrin Capsules daily.</p><p><span class="Bold">Folic Acid</span> - Folic acid deficiency is the immediate cause of most, if not all, cases</p><p>of nutritional megaloblastic anemia and of the megaloblastic anemias of pregnancy</p><p>and infancy; usually, it is also at least partially responsible for the megaloblastic</p><p>anemias of malabsorption syndromes, e.g., tropical and nontropical sprue.</p><p>It is apparent that in vitamin B-12 deficiency (e.g., pernicious anemia), lack of this</p><p>vitamin results in impaired utilization of folic acid. There are other evidences of the</p><p>close folic acid-vitamin B-12 interrelationship: (1) B-12 influences the storage,</p><p>absorption, and utilization of folic acid, and (2) as a deficiency of B-12 progresses,</p><p>the requirement for folic acid increases. However, folic acid does not change the</p><p>requirement for vitamin B-12.</p><p><span class="Bold">Iron</span> - A very common anemia is that due to iron deficiency. In most cases, the</p><p>response to iron salts is prompt, safe, and predictable. Within limits, the response</p><p>is quicker and more certain to large doses of iron than to small doses. Each</p><p>Ferotrin Capsule furnishes 110 mg. of elemental iron (as ferrous fumarate) to</p><p>provide a maximum response.</p><p><span class="Bold">Ascorbic Acid</span> - Vitamin C plays a role in anemia therapy. It augments the</p><p>conversion of folic acid to its active form, folinic acid. In addition, ascorbic acid</p><p>promotes the reduction of ferric iron in food to the more readily absorbed ferrous</p><p>form. Severe and prolonged vitamin C deficiency is associated with an anemia that</p><p>is usually hypochromic but occasionally megaloblastic in type.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Ferotrin</h2><p class="First">This capsule (hematinic concentrate with intrinsic factor) is a multifactor preparation</p><p>effective in the treatment of anemias that respond to oral hematinics, including</p><p>pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias and also iron deficiency</p><p>anemia. Therapeutic quantities of hematopoietic factors that are known to be</p><p>important are present in the recommended daily dose.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Hemochromatosis and hemosiderosis are contraindications to iron therapy.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a</span></p><p><span class="Bold">leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under six. Keep this</span></p><p><span class="Bold">product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose,</span></p><p><span class="Bold">call a doctor or Poison Control Center immediately.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that</p><p>hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. Anemia</p><p>is a manifestation that requires appropriate investigation to determine its cause or causes. Folic</p><p>acid alone is unwarranted in the treatment of pure vitamin B12 deficiency states, such as</p><p>pernicious anemia.</p><p>Folic acid may obscure pernicious anemia in that the blood picture may revert to normal</p><p>while neurological manifestations remain progressive.</p><p>As with all preparations containing intrinsic factor, resistance may develop in some cases of</p><p>pernicious anemia to the potentiation of absorption of physiologic doses of vitamin B-12. If</p><p>resistance occurs, parenteral therapy or oral therapy with so-called massive doses of vitamin</p><p>B-12 may be necessary for adequate treatment of the patient. No single regimen fits all</p><p>cases, and the status of the patient observed in follow-up is the final criterion for adequacy of</p><p>therapy. Periodic clinical and laboratory studies are considered essential and are</p><p>recommended.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><h3>Interactions</h3><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C</span>: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted</p><p>with this product. It is also not known whether this product can cause fetal harm when</p><p>administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. This product should</p><p>be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because</p><p>many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when this product is</p><p>administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 10 have not been</p><p>established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies on this product have not been performed in sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Rarely, iron in therapeutic doses produces gastrointestinal reactions, such as diarrhea or</p><p>constipation. Reducing the dose and administering it with meals will minimize these effects in</p><p>the iron-sensitive patient.</p><p>In extremely rare instances, skin rash suggesting allergy has been noted following the oral</p><p>administration of liver-stomach material. Allergic sensitization has been reported following</p><p>both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><h3>Abuse</h3><h3>Dependence</h3><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Symptoms:</span> Those of iron intoxication, which may include pallor and cyanosis, vomiting,</p><p>hematemesis, diarrhea, melena, shock, drowsiness, and coma.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment:</span> For specific therapy, exchange transfusion and chelating agents. For general</p><p>management, gastric and rectal lavage with sodium bicarbonate solution or milk,</p><p>administration of intravenous fluids and electrolytes, and use of oxygen.</p><h2>Ferotrin Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">One capsule twice a day.
