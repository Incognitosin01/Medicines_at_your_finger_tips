Each softgel is purple in color, opaque and imprinted with "343" on one side.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">EACH SOFTGEL CONTAINS:</span></p><h3>OTHER INGREDIENTS:</h3><p class="First">soybean oil, yellow bee's wax, lecithin, natural orange cream flavoring, gelatin, glycerine, purified water, carmine, titanium dioxide, ethyl vanillin, FD&amp;C#40, and FD&amp;C Blue #1.</p><h2>INDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Prenaissance Plus is a multivitamin/mineral prescription drug indicated for use in improving the nutritional status of women prior to conception, throughout pregnancy, and in the postnatal period for both lactating and nonlactating mothers.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.</p><h2>WARNING:</h2><p class="First">Ingestion of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids (such as DHA) per day has been shown to have potential antithrombotic effects, including an increased bleeding time and International Normalized Ratio (INR). Administration of omega-3 fatty acids should be avoided in patients taking anticoagulants and in those known to have an inherited or acquired predisposition to bleeding.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING:</span> Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is deficient. Folic acid in doses above 1.0 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations progress.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.</p><h2>CAUTION:</h2><p class="First">Exercise caution to ensure that the prescribed dosage of DHA does not exceed 1 gram (1000 mg) daily.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First">Usual adult dose is 1 (one) softgel daily or as directed by a physician.</p><h2>NOTICE:</h2><p class="First">Contact the moisture can discolor or erode the capsule.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED:</h2><p class="First">Prenaissance Plus is supplied in child-resistant bottles of 30 softgels (NDC# 42192-343-30).</p><p>Store at 15° - 30°C (59° - 86°F) [See USP].</p><p><span class="Bold">KEEP THIS AND ALL MEDICATIONS OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.</span></p><p class="First">All prescription substitutions and/or recommendations using this product shall be made subject to state and federal statutes as applicable. <span class="Bold">Please note: this is not an Orange Book product and has not been subjected to FDA therapeutic equivalency or other equivalency testing.
