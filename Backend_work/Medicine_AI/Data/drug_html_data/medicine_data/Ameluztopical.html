Skin cells treated with this medicine will die and slough off after being exposed to a special light treatment.</p><p>Ameluz is used to treat actinic keratosis (warty overgrowths of skin) on the face and scalp.  Ameluz is used together with a special light treatment, also called photodynamic therapy.</p><p>Ameluz may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Avoid exposure to sunlight or bright indoor light for up to 48 hours after this medicine is applied to your skin or scalp</b>.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with Ameluz if you are allergic to it.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

<p>The treated skin will be covered with a dressing to block out light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 3 hours, the dressing will be removed and light treatment will be applied to the lesions.</p>

<li>
<p>You must return to your doctor's office within 14 to 18 hours afterward to receive light treatment.</p>

</ul><p>You must return to your doctor's office within 14 to 18 hours afterward to receive light treatment.</p><p>Once the solution has been applied, keep the treated skin dry.</p><p>Do not wash the skin while waiting for your light treatment.</p><p>The photodynamic light has a low intensity and will not heat your skin. However, you may feel tingling, stinging, prickling, or burning where Ameluz was applied. This discomfort is usually temporary.</p><p>For up to 48 hours, you will need to protect your skin from bright light. <b>Sunscreen will not be effective enough to protect you while this medicine is on your skin or scalp</b>. Avoid exposure to both sunlight and bright indoor light. Wear protective clothing and a wide-brimmed hat when you are outdoors. If you feel stinging or burning of the treated skin, reduce your exposure to light.</p><p>You may have some redness, swelling, and scaling of your lesions and the surrounding skin. These symptoms should go away completely within 4 weeks.</p><p>Call your doctor if you have severe skin discomfort, or if you have new or worsening skin problems.</p><p>If your actinic keratosis lesions do not clear up completely, you may need a second treatment. Levulan Kerastick and light treatment can be repeated after 8 weeks. Ameluz and light treatment can be repeated after 3 months.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you cannot return for your light treatment within the recommended 14 to 18 hours after <b>Levulan Kerastick</b> was applied. The timing of this medicine and light treatment is extremely important to the success of your treatment.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since  Ameluz is applied by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving  Ameluz?</h2><p><b>Avoid exposure to sunlight or bright indoor light for up to 48 hours</b>. Wear a hat and clothing that covers your skin.
