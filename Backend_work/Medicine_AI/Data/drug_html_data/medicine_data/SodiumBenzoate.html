IV dosing is usually required for acute episodes; if IV administration is necessary, see the Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate monograph for information about a commercially available parenteral product.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Sodium benzoate is not commercially available as a ready-to-use product; however, some centers are still using compounded formulations when necessary. IV dosing is usually required for acute episodes; if IV administration is necessary, see the Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate monograph for information about a commercially available parenteral product.</p><p><b>Urea cycle disorders, long-term therapy:</b> Very limited data available: Dosage should be individualized based on patient response; consult metabolic specialist: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Oral: 250 to 500 mg/kg/day in 3 to 4 divided doses given with meals (Häberle 2012; Kliegman 2016, Maestri 1991; Maestri 1996).</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Oral: Administer with meals and abundant fluid (Häberle 2012). Not commercially available; must be compounded using chemical powder; consult metabolic specialist.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Probenecid: May increase the serum concentration of Sodium Benzoate. Specifically, probenecid may inhibit the renal transport of the hippuric acid metabolite of sodium benzoate.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Frequency not defined. Adverse reactions are from multiple indications and dosing.</p><p>Cardiovascular: ECG abnormality (Sushma 1992)</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Anorexia (Wolff 1986), dyspepsia (Sushma 1992), epigastric distress (Sushma 1992), gastritis (Häberle 2012), mucositis (Häberle 2012), nausea (Sushma 1992), vomiting (Sushma 1992; Wolff 1986)</p><p>Endocrine &amp; metabolic: Hypokalemia (Häberle 2012), increased serum sodium (Sushma 1992), metabolic acidosis (Häberle 2012)</p><p>Renal: Renal tubular disease (Wolff 1986)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><i><b>Disease-related concerns:</b></i></p><p>• Acidemia: Use with caution in patients with propionic or methylmalonic acidemia (Kliegman 2016).</p><p>• Reye syndrome: Use with caution in patients with Reye syndrome (Kliegman 2016).</p><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Neonates: Use with caution in neonates with hyperbilirubinemia due to potential displacement of bilirubin from albumin binding sites (Kliegman 2016).</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• Availability: Sodium benzoate is not commercially available as a ready-to-use product; however, some centers are still using compounded formulations when necessary.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Plasma ammonia, plasma amino acid (quantitative) and glutamine concentrations, blood glucose, serum electrolytes, hepatic and renal function tests, blood gases, neurologic status, physical signs/symptoms of hyperammonemia (ie, lethargy, ataxia, confusion, vomiting, seizures, and memory impairment) (Häberle 2012; Lichter-Konecki 2016).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Benzoate can be detected in the umbilical cord and newborn serum following maternal administration of sodium benzoate prior to delivery (Das 2009).</p><p>Information related to the use of sodium benzoate for urea cycle disorders (UCD), including ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, during pregnancy is limited (Häberle 2012; Lamb 2013; Mendez-Figueroa 2010). Pregnancy is a high metabolic state that can trigger hyperamonemic episodes in females with known OTC deficiency as well as asymptomatic female carriers; close monitoring is recommended during pregnancy and for 5 days postpartum (Arn 1990; Häberle 2012; Mendez-Figueroa 2010). Maternal treatment with oral sodium benzoate is recommended if serum ammonia is 1.5 to 2 times normal (Mendez-Figueroa 2010). Administration of sodium benzoate to the mother to prevent adverse events in newborns prenatally diagnosed with a UCD has also been described (Das 2009). In general, females with inherited metabolic disease should achieve adequate metabolic control prior to conception (Häberle 2012; Langendonk 2012).</p><h2>Further information</h2><p class="ddc-disclaimer">Always consult your healthcare provider to ensure the information displayed on this page applies to your personal circumstances.</p><p class="ddc-disclaimer-link">Medical Disclaimer</p></body></html>
