</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Thrombin Human</h2><p class="First">EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> Thrombin, Topical (Human), is indicated as an aid to hemostasis whenever oozing blood and minor bleeding from capillaries and small venules is accessible and control of bleeding by standard surgical techniques (such as suture, ligature or cautery) is ineffective or impractical.</p><p>EVITHROM <span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> Thrombin, Topical (Human), may be used in conjunction with an Absorbable Gelatin Sponge, USP.</p><h2>Thrombin Human Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dose</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For Topical Use Only. DO NOT INJECT.</span></p><p>The amount of EVITHROM <span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> required depends upon the area of tissue to be treated and the method of application. As an approximate guide, volumes up to 10 ml were used in clinical studies where EVITHROM <span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> was used in conjunction with Absorbable Gelatin Sponge, USP.</p><h3>Preparation</h3><ul>
<li>Use aseptic technique when handling vials and syringes.</li>
<li>Remove the flip-off plastic cap from the vial to expose the rubber stopper.</li>
<li>Reconstitute the lyophilized human thrombin powder with 2 ml of sterile Water for Injection, USP using the provided reconstitution device.</li>
<li>Shake gently until the solution is clear.</li>
<li>Reconstituted solution is stable for up to 8 hours at room temperature and should be used within this time period.</li>
</ul><h3>Application Techniques</h3><p class="First">Apply only on the surface of bleeding tissue.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> Use alone</span></p><ul>
<li>Sponge target surface (do not wipe) or suction free of blood before application.</li>
<li>Flood the surface with EVITHROM <span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> using a sterile syringe and small gauge needle.</li>
<li>Avoid sponging after treatment, to ensure that the clot remains securely in place.</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> in conjunction with Absorbable Gelatin Sponge, USP</span></p><ul>
<li>Prepare the desired shape of the Absorbable Gelatin Sponge, USP (see Absorbable Gelatin Sponge, USP circular for additional instructions for use).</li>
<li>Transfer EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> into a sterile container using aseptic techniques.</li>
<li>Immerse gelatin sponge into the EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> solution.</li>
<li>Vigorously knead the sponge with moistened gloved fingers until all air is expelled and it can return to its original size and shape.</li>
<li>Hold the saturated sponge in place with gauze or cotton pledget using moderate pressure until hemostasis is achieved.</li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> is a sterile lyophilized powder for solution 2000 (1600–2400) units of lyophilized human thrombin powder for reconstitution. After reconstituted, the final solution contains 1000 (800–1200) units/ml of human thrombin.</p><p>Potency, expressed in units, is determined using a clotting assay against an internal reference standard for potency that has been calibrated against the World Health Organisation (WHO) Second International Standard for Thrombin, 01/580. Therefore, a unit used herein is equivalent to an International Unit.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><ul>
<li><span class="Bold">Do not use in individuals known to have an anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> or to human blood products.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Do not use for the treatment of severe or brisk arterial bleeding.</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Thrombosis</h3><p class="First">There is a risk of thrombosis if absorbed systemically. Apply topically only.</p><h3>Anaphylactic/Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Anaphylactic reactions may occur in rare cases. No adverse events of this type were reported during the conduct of the clinical trials. Severe hypotensive reactions require immediate intervention using current principles of shock therapy.</p><h3>Transmission of Infectious Agents</h3><p class="First">Because this product is made from human plasma, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, such as viruses, and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. The risk of transmitting an infectious agent has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing for the presence of certain current virus infections and by inactivating and removing certain viruses. Despite these measures, such products can still potentially transmit disease. There is also the possibility that unknown infectious agents may be present in such products.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most common adverse reactions during clinical trial (reported in at least 2% of subjects treated with EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span>) were prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, increased INR, decreased lymphocyte count, prolonged prothrombin time and increased neutrophil count.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug product cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>In a multicenter, prospective, controlled, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial of 305 subjects where EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> (n=153) was compared with bovine thrombin (n=152), occurrence of adverse events was not statistically different between the two groups.</p><p>Overall, adverse events occurred in similar proportions of subjects in the two groups (see Table 1). No clinically significant differences were seen in age (&lt;65 years, &gt;65 years) or gender subgroup analyses of adverse events.</p><p>At least one serious adverse event (SAE) was reported for 26/153 (17%) subjects treated with human thrombin and 17/152 (11%) subjects treated with bovine thrombin. The SAEs reported were associated with post-surgical complications (e.g. wound infection 3/153 for EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> and 2/152 for bovine thrombin) and the medical condition of the subject and were not considered related to study drug. Two subjects (1.3%) in EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> group experienced a treatment emergent severe adverse event: respiratory arrest and post-procedural hematoma (in one subject) and extradural hematoma. Three subjects in the bovine thrombin group experienced a treatment emergent severe adverse event: hyperhidrosis, pyrexia and post-procedural hematoma.</p><p>No deaths were reported during the study period.</p><p>Viral serology was not monitored during the trial with EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span>. However, no adverse events indicative of infection with transfusion-transmissible agents were reported.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Immunogenicity</span></p><p>In the clinical study, serum samples were collected at baseline and at 5 weeks post-surgery for evaluation of antibodies to bovine thrombin, bovine Factor V/Va, human thrombin, and human Factor V/Va. Samples were collected at both time points for 81.3% of the subjects. The ELISA data were adjudicated by a panel of experts blinded to treatment assignment. After reviewing all data, the panel used an algorithm for assigning outcomes for each antigen: seroconversion negative or seroconversion positive.</p><p>The protocol did not specify any comparative analysis for immunogenicity data, only descriptive statistics. The adjudicated results show that 3.3% of the subjects treated with EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> (frozen formulation) developed antibodies to any of the four antigens, compared to 12.7% of the subjects developing antibodies in the control group (bovine thrombin). 7.9% of the subjects treated with bovine thrombin (control group) developed antibodies to bovine thrombin and 9.5% of these subjects developed antibodies to bovine Factor V/Va. A few control subjects had antibodies that cross-reacted with human thrombin, but none had antibodies that cross-reacted with human Factor V/Va. None of the patients treated with EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> developed detectable antibodies to human thrombin or to human Factor V/Va.</p><p>The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent upon the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. The observed incidence of a positive signal in an assay may be influenced by several factors including timing of sampling, sample handling, concomitant medications, or underlying disease. Therefore, direct comparison of incidence of antibody development to human thrombin, bovine thrombin, human Factor V/Va or bovine Factor V/Va following administration of EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> with incidence of antibody development following administration of other products may be misleading and the clinical significance of these findings is unknown.</p><h3>Post Marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">No adverse reactions have been identified from spontaneous post-marketing reports.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span>. It is also not known whether EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><p>Evaluation of the reproduction and development toxicity has been limited to the evaluation of embryo-fetal development of TnBP and Triton X-100 formulated in saline in rat and rabbit (see <span class="Italics">Section 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</span> for more information) <span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">The safety of EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> for use during labor and delivery has not been established.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">The safety of EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> for use during breast-feeding has not been established. Use only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 155 patients undergoing liver surgery who were treated in adequate and well-controlled studies of EVICEL <span class="Sup">®</span> Fibrin Sealant (Human), in which EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> is a component, eight were pediatric patients. Of these, five were less than 2 years old and three were between 2 and 12 years old. Use of EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> in pediatric patients is supported by these data and by extrapolation of findings for safety and efficacy in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Sixty three (63) subjects over 65 years of age received EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> in the clinical trial. No differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between the elderly and younger patients. Greater susceptibility of older patients to adverse reactions cannot be ruled out.</p><h2>Thrombin Human Description</h2><p class="First">EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> is a sterile lyophilized powder of purified human thrombin (1600–2400 units) of white to slightly yellowish color. When reconstituted, EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> solution, pH 6.8–7.2, is clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to slightly yellowish. Other inactive ingredients are Calcium chloride, Human albumin, Mannitol, Sodium acetate.</p><p>EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> is made from pooled Human Source obtained from US licensed plasma collection centers. Individual plasma units obtained for production of EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> are tested by licensed serological tests for HBsAg, HIV 1 &amp; 2 Ab and HCV Ab. Additionally, the plasma units are tested by licensed Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) for HIV-1, HCV, HBV, HAV and parvovirus B19. All tests for HIV, HCV, HBV and HAV must be negative (non-reactive). However, since the effectiveness of the HBV and HAV NAT methods in detecting low levels of viral material is still under investigation, the significance of a negative result for these viruses is unknown. The level of parvovirus B19 contamination is not permitted to exceed 10,000 copies/ml. This limit is applied to restrict the viral load of parvovirus B19 in the starting plasma pool. In addition to the screening of plasma units, each manufacturing pool is tested for HBsAg, HIV-1 &amp; 2 Ab, HCV NAT and for parvovirus B19 by NAT. Manufacturing pool testing, however, is of lower sensitivity than individual unit testing.</p><p>EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> is manufactured by chromatographic purification of prothrombin from cryo-poor plasma followed by activation with calcium chloride. The manufacturing process includes two targeted steps for inactivation or removal of viruses. The first of these is treatment with a solvent/detergent (S/D) mixture (1% tri-n-butyl phosphate, 1% Triton X-100) for 6 hours at 26°C to inactivate lipid enveloped viruses. The S/D reagents are removed by cation exchange chromatography. Mannitol and human albumin are used to stabilize the solution, which undergoes nanofiltration for removal of both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. After nanofiltration, the solution is formulated with calcium chloride, sterile filtered and aseptically filled and frozen.</p><p>The effectiveness of the S/D treatment and nanofiltration procedures for reducing virus content has been assessed using a series of viruses with a range of physico-chemical characteristics. The results of the validation studies are summarized in Table 2.</p><h2>Thrombin Human - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> requires no intermediate physiological agent because it clots the fibrinogen of the blood directly. Failure to clot blood occurs in the rare case where the primary clotting defect is the absence of fibrinogen itself. The speed with which thrombin clots blood is dependent upon the concentration of both thrombin and fibrinogen.</p><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Thrombin (coagulation Factor IIa) is a highly specific protease that transforms plasma fibrinogen into fibrin which, in the presence of Factor XIII in the patient's plasma, is cross-linked to form a stable clot. When applied to a surgical wound where bleeding is present, thrombin activates fibrinogen in the patient's plasma to form fibrin, which results in clot formation and hemostasis. The fibrin clot is stabilized by cross-linking occurring as a result of activation of the patient's endogenous Factor XIII, which requires the presence of calcium.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> due to the human origin of thrombin.</p><p>Studies were performed in bacteria to determine mutagenicity of human thrombin alone, and solvent/detergent residues [tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP) and Triton X-100], used in the virus inactivation manufacturing step. These studies were negative for both thrombin and for TnBP or Triton X-100 at all concentrations tested. All concentrations of the combination of TnBP and Triton X-100 also tested negative in assays performed to determine mammalian cell mutagenicity, chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei induction.</p><p>The effect of EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> on fertility has not been evaluated. Reproductive studies were performed in rats with the combination of solvent detergent impurities, TnBP and Triton X-100 at doses up to approximately 600-fold human dose of TnBP (900 μg/kg/day) and 3000-fold human dose of Triton X-100 (4500 μg/kg/day) resulted in increased post-implantation loss and an increased number of late resorptions. Other studies performed with combinations of TnBP (300-fold human dose, 450 μg/kg/day) and Triton X-100 (1500-fold human dose, 2250 μg/kg/day) resulted in increased resorption rates, decreased fetal body weights, and an increased number of runts. No embryo-fetal adverse effects were observed at doses up to 300 μg/kg/day TnBP and 1500 μg/kg/day Triton X-100, 200-fold and 1000-fold the human dose, respectively.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">EVICEL <span class="Sup">®</span> Fibrin Sealant (Human), which includes EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> as one of the active components, was classified as non-irritant in the Primary Cutaneous Irritation Test and slightly irritant in the Ocular Irritation test.</p><p>Neurotoxicity studies performed with EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> or with EVICEL <span class="Sup">®</span> confirmed that intracerebral application of thrombin was not associated with any evidence of neurotoxicity.</p><p>No toxicological effects due to solvent/detergent reagents [tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP) and Triton X-100] used in the virus inactivation procedure are expected since the residual levels are less than 5 μg/ml.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> was compared with bovine thrombin in a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded clinical trial of 305 subjects at 22 centers in the US. Subjects undergoing elective cardiovascular, neurologic (spinal) or general surgical procedures were randomized (stratified by surgical specialty) when there was oozing or bleeding of mild intensity that could not be controlled by other surgical techniques and the surgeon determined that a topical hemostatic agent was necessary. Bovine thrombin and EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> were applied with SURGIFOAM <span class="Sup">®</span> Absorbable Gelatin Sponge, USP.</p><p>Treatment with EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> was comparable to treatment with bovine thrombin in achieving hemostasis within:</p><ul>
<li>10 minutes of product application and</li>
<li>6 and 3 minutes of product application.</li>
</ul><p>At the 6 minute and 10 minute time points, &gt;90% of subjects from all surgeries in both study groups had achieved hemostasis. The following results were documented for the 3 minute time point as stratified by surgery and study treatment: (1) cardiovascular surgery – human thrombin: 61.7%; bovine thrombin: 63.0%, (2) spinal surgery – human thrombin: 83.6%; bovine thrombin: 80.0%, (3) general surgery – human thrombin: 71.1%; bovine thrombin: 71.7% for an overall ratio of proportions of 1.01.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> is supplied in a single-use 2 ml vial containing 2000 (1600–2400) units of lyophilized human thrombin powder for reconstitution in 2 ml Water for Injection, USP.

</ul><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">Inform patients of the following:</p><ul>
<li>Some viruses such as hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19 are particularly difficult to remove or inactivate. Parvovirus B19 most seriously affects pregnant women or immune-compromised individuals. Symptoms of parvovirus B19 infection include: fever, drowsiness, chills and runny nose followed about two weeks later by a rash and joint pain. Evidence of hepatitis A may include several days to weeks of poor appetite, fatigue and low-grade fever followed by nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Dark urine and a yellowed complexion are also common symptoms. Consult your physician if such symptoms appear.</li>
<li>If absorbed systemically EVITHROM <span class="Sup">®</span> could potentially cause blood clotting disorders. Consult your physician if leg tenderness or swelling, chest pain, or shortness of breath appears.</li>
