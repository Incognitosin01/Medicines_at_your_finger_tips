Hydroquinone occurs as fine, white needles. The drug is freely soluble in water and in alcohol. Chemically, hydroquinone is designated as p-dihydroxybenzene; the empirical formula is C6H6O2; molecular weight is 110.11 g per mol.</p><p>The chemical structure is in the diagram.</p><h2>Obagi-C Rx System - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Topical application of hydroquinone produces a reversible depigmentation of the skin by inhibition of the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine to 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and suppression of other melanocyte metabolic processes. Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light will cause repigmentation of the bleached areas, which may be prevented by the use of sunscreen agents contained in the Obagi-C® Rx System Sun Shield Matte Broad Spectrum SPF 50.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Obagi-C Rx System</h2><p class="First">The gradual bleaching of hyperpigmented skin conditions such as chloasma, melasma, freckles, senile lentigines, and other unwanted areas of melanin hyperpigmentation.</p><h2>Obagi-C Rx System Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">A thin application should be applied once or twice daily or as directed by a physician. If no improvement is seen after three (3) months of treatment, use of this product should be discontinued. Sun exposure should be limited by using a sunscreen agent or protective clothing to cover bleached skin when using and after using this product in order to prevent darkening from reoccurring.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">• Hydroquinone is a skin-bleaching agent, which may produce unwanted cosmetic effects if not used as directed. The physician should be familiar with the contents of this insert before prescribing or dispensing this product.</p><p>• Test for skin sensitivity before using by applying a small amount to an unbroken patch of skin and check within 24 hours. Minor redness is not a contraindication, but where there is itching or vesicle formation or excessive inflammatory response, the product should be discontinued and a physician consulted. Close patient supervision is recommended.</p><p>• Avoid contact with eyes, nose, mouth, and lips. In case of accidental contact, the patient should rinse thoroughly with water and contact a physician.</p><p>• Sunscreen use is an essential aspect of hydroquinone therapy because even minimal sunlight exposure sustains melanocytic activity.</p><p><span class="Bold">The Obagi-C</span>® <span class="Bold">Rx System C-Therapy Night Cream contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(See WARNINGS<span class="Bold">.</span>)</span></p><p>Treatment should be limited to relatively small areas of the body at one time since some patients experience a transient skin reddening and a mild burning sensation, which does not preclude treatment.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C</span></p><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with topical hydroquinone. It is also not known whether hydroquinone can cause fetal harm when used topically on a pregnant woman or affect reproductive capacity. It is not known to what degree, if any, topical hydroquinone is absorbed systemically. Topical hydroquinone should be used on pregnant women only when clearly indicated.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether topical hydroquinone is absorbed or excreted in human milk. Caution is advised when topical hydroquinone is used by a nursing mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Usage</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children, below the age of 12 years, have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">No systemic adverse reactions have been reported. Occasional hypersensitivity (localized contact dermatitis) may occur, in which case the product should be discontinued and physician notified immediately.</p><p><span class="Bold">To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Obagi Medical Products, a division of Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America LLC, at 1-800-321-4576 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">People with prior history of sensitivity or allergic reaction to this product or any of its ingredients should not use it.
