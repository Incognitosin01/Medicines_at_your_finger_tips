Low levels of dopamine in the brain are associated with Parkinson's disease.</p><p>Pramipexole is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease (stiffness, tremors, muscle spasms, and poor muscle control). Pramipexole is also used to treat restless legs syndrome (RLS).</p><p>Only immediate-release pramipexole (Mirapex) is approved to treat either Parkinson symptoms or RLS. Extended-release pramipexole (Mirapex ER) is approved only to treat Parkinson symptoms.</p><p>Parkinson's and RLS are two separate disorders. Having one of these conditions will not cause you to have the other condition.</p><p>Pramipexole may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package.
