</ul><p class="First">When diluted as directed, the solution is clear and colorless.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p>Suprep Bowel Prep Kit is contraindicated in the following conditions:</p><ul>
<li>Gastrointestinal obstruction or ileus  <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6)]</span></li>
<li>Bowel perforation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precaution ( 5.6)]</span></li>
<li>Toxic colitis or toxic megacolon</li>
<li>Gastric retention</li>
<li>Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in Suprep Bowel Prep Kit</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking Suprep Bowel Prep Kit, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN).</p><p>Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment. Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with Suprep Bowel Prep Kit. Use Suprep Bowel Prep Kit with caution in patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions ( 7.1)]</span> .</p><p>Suprep Bowel Prep Kit can cause temporary elevations in uric acid <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]</span> . Uric acid fluctuations in patients with gout may precipitate an acute flare. The potential for uric acid elevation should be considered before administering Suprep Bowel Prep Kit to patients with gout or other disorders of uric acid metabolism.</p><h3>Cardiac Arrhythmias</h3><p class="First">There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing Suprep Bowel Prep Kit for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.</p><p>Use caution when prescribing Suprep Bowel Prep Kit for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions ( 7.1)]</span> .</p><h3>Use in Patients with Risk of Renal Injury</h3><p class="First">Use Suprep Bowel Prep Kit with caution in patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions ( 7.1)]</span> . These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration with SUPREP Bowl Prep Kit and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6)]</span> .</p><h3>Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis</h3><p class="First">Osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and Suprep Bowel Prep Kit may increase these risks <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions ( 7.3)]</span> . Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p><h3>Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease</h3><p class="First">If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering Suprep Bowel Prep Kit  <span class="Italics">[see Contrandications ( 4)]</span> ﻿.</p><p>Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.</p><h3>Aspiration</h3><p class="First">Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit solution. Observe these patients during administration of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit solution. Use with caution in these patients.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following important adverse reactions for bowel preparations are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul>

<span class="Bold">Pediatrics 12 Years to 16 Years of Age</span></p><p>The safety of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit was evaluated in a single dose-ranging clinical trial of 89 pediatric patients aged 12 years to 16 years <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies ( 14)]</span> . In 26 pediatric patients who received Suprep Bowel Prep Kit (two 4.5-ounce doses), the most common adverse reactions (&gt; 10%) were nausea, abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, and vomiting.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drugs That May Increase Risks of Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Use caution when prescribing Suprep Bowel Prep Kit to patients taking medications that increase the risk of fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and prolonged QT in the setting of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4)].</span></p><h3>Potential for Reduced Drug Absorption</h3><p class="First">Suprep Bowel Prep Kit can reduce the absorption of other co-administered drugs <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1)]</span> .</p><ul>
<li>Administer oral medications at least one hour before starting each dose of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit.</li>
<li>Administer tetracycline and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, iron, digoxin, chlorpromazine, and penicillamine at least 2 hours before and not less than 6 hours after administration of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit to avoid chelation with magnesium.</li>
</ul><h3>Stimulant Laxatives</h3><p class="First">Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and Suprep Bowel Prep Kit may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis. Avoid use of stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate) while taking SUPRPEP Bowel Prep Kit <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5)]</span> .</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
There are no available data on Suprep Bowel Prep Kit use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate (Suprep Bowel Prep Kit).</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major bi rth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
There are no data available data on the presence of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Suprep Bowel Prep Kit and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Suprep Bowel Prep Kit or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit (two 4.5-ounce doses) have been established for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Use of SUPPREP Bowel Prep Kit in this age group is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled trial of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit in adults and a single, dose-ranging, controlled trial in 89 pediatric patients 12 years to 16 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies ( 14)]</span> . In the pediatric trial, Suprep Bowel Prep Kit (two 6-ounce doses) did not demonstrate additional treatment benefit and more patients reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions compared to Suprep Bowel Prep Kit (two 4.5-ounce doses). Therefore, Suprep Bowel Prep Kit (two 6-ounce doses) is not recommended for pediatric patients 12 years of age and older <span class="Italics">[see Dosage </span><span class="Italics">and Administration ( 2.3)]</span> . The safety profile of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit (two 4.5-ounce doses) in this pediatric population was similar to that seen in adults <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]</span> .</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 375 patients who received Suprep Bowel Prep Kit in clinical trials, 94 (25%) were 65 years of age or older, and 25 (7%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit, administered as the recommended split-dose (2-day) regimen, were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients. Geriatric patients reported more vomiting when Suprep Bowel Prep Kit was given as a one-day preparation (not a recommended regimen). Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and may be more susceptible to adverse reactions resulting from fluid and electrolyte abnormalities <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]</span> .</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Use Suprep Bowel Prep Kit with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function. These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after use of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)]</span> .</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdosage of more than the recommended dose of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit may lead to severe electrolyte disturbances, as well as dehydration and hypovolemia, with signs and symptoms of these disturbances. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1, 5.2, 5.3)</span> <span class="Italics">]</span>.

The osmotic effect of unabsorbed sulfate anions and the associated cations causes water to be retained within the gastrointestinal tract.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">No formal pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with Suprep Bowel Prep Kit.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption and Elimination</span></p><p>After administration of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit in six healthy subjects, the time at which serum sulfate reached its highest point (Tmax) was approximately 17 hours after the first dose or approximately 5 hours after the second dose, and then declined with a half-life of 8.5 hours.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Fecal excretion was the primary route of sulfate elimination.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit was studied in patients (N=6) with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment, mean AUC was 54% higher and mean Cmax was 44% higher, than healthy subjects.</p><p>The mean sulfate concentrations in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate renal impairment returned to their respective baselines by Day 6 after dose initiation. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours after the first dose was approximately 16% lower in patients with moderate renal impairment than in healthy subjects. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit was studied in patients (N=6) with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grades A and B). Systemic exposure of serum sulfate (AUC and Cmax) was similar between healthy subjects and patients with hepatic impairment. The mean sulfate concentrations in healthy subjects and in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment returned<br/>
to their respective baselines by Day 6 after dose initiation. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours after the first dose was similar between patients with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">The sulfate salts of sodium, potassium, and magnesium contained in Suprep Bowel Prep Kit were administered orally (gavage) to rats and dogs up to 28 days up to a maximum daily dose of 5 grams/kg/day (approximately 0.9 and 3 times for rats and dogs, respectively, the recommended human dose of 44 grams/day or 0.89 grams/kg based on the body surface area). In rats, the sulfate salts caused diarrhea and electrolyte and metabolic changes, including hypochloremia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, lower serum osmolality, and high serum bicarbonate. Significant renal changes included increased fractional sodium excretion, increased urinary sodium and potassium excretion, and alkaline urine in both males and  females. In addition, creatinine clearance was significantly decreased in females at the highest dose. No microscopic renal changes were seen. In dogs, the sulfate salts caused emesis, excessive salivation, excessive drinking of water, and abnormal excreta (soft and/or mucoid feces and/or diarrhea) and increased urine pH and sodium excretion.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The colon cleansing efficacy of Suprep Bowel Prep Kit was evaluated in a randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study in adult patients scheduled to have a colonoscopy. There were 363 adult patients included in the efficacy analysis. Patients ranged in age from 20 to 84 years (mean age 55 years) and 54% were female. Race distribution was 86% Caucasian, 9% African-American, and 5% other.</p><p>Patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation regimens: Suprep Bowel Prep Kit or a marketed polyethylene glycol (PEG) plus electrolytes bowel preparation. In the Study Suprep Bowel Prep Kit was administered as a split-dose (two-day) regimen. The PEG bowel prep was also given as a split-dose preparation according to its labeled instructions. Patients receiving Suprep Bowel Prep Kit were limited to a light breakfast followed by clear liquids on the day prior to the day of colonoscopy; patients receiving the PEG bowel prep were allowed to have a normal breakfast and a light lunch, followed by clear liquids.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing as assessed by the colonoscopists, who were not informed about the type of preparation received, as shown in Table 3. In the study, no clinically or statistically significant differences were seen between the group treated with Suprep Bowel Prep Kit and the group treated with the PEG bowel prep.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">1</span> Responders were patients whose colon preparations were graded excellent (no more than small bits of adherent feces/fluid) or good (small amounts of feces or fluid not interfering with the exam) by the colonoscopist.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">2</span> Does not equal difference in tabled responder rates due to rounding effects.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">2%</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">2</span></span></p><p>(-2%, 5%)</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients 12 Years to 16 Years of Age</span></p><p>Suprep Bowel Prep Kit was evaluated for colon cleansing in a randomized, single-blind, multicenter, doseranging, active-controlled study in 89 pediatric patients 12 years to 16 years of age. The majority of patients were female (57%), white (78%), and of non-Hispanic or non-Latino ethnicity (91%). The mean age was 14 years.
