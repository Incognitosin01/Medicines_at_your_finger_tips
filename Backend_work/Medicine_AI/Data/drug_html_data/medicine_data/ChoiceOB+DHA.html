Each tablet contains:</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">OTHER INGREDIENTS (softgel):</span> bovine gelatin, glycerin USP and water.</p><p>DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid contained in oil derived from microalgea.</p><p><span class="Bold">OTHER INGREDIENTS (tablet):</span> cherry flavor, citric acid, crossacarmelose sodium, fructose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, silicon dioxide, sorbitol, stevia and strawberry flavor.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS:</span> Choice - OB + DHA is indicated to provide vitamin, mineral and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation prior to conception, throughout pregnancy and during the postnatal period for the lactating and non-lactating mother, including those individuals with known allergies to fish. Choice - OB + DHA does not contain fish, fish oils, fish proteins or fish byproducts.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS:</span> Folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid) is contraindicated in patients with untreated and uncomplicated pernicious anemia, and in those with anaphylactic sensitivity to folic acid. Iron therapy is contraindicated in patients with hemochromatosis and patients with iron storage disease or the potential for iron storage disease due to chronic hemolytic anemia (e.g., inherited anomalies of hemoglobin structure or synthesis and/or red cell enzyme deficiencies, etc.), pyridoxine responsive anemia or cirrhosis of the liver. Cyanocobalamin is contraindicated in patients with sensitivity to cobalt or to cyanocobalamin (vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>). Resistance to treatment may be due to depressed hematopoiesis, alcoholism, the presence of anti-metabolic drugs and to deficiencies of vitamins. Prolonged use of iron salts may produce iron storage disease.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING:</span> Pernicious anemia should be ruled out before starting treatment. While folic acid corrects the blood picture of pernicious anemia, it does not ameliorate the attendant neurologic involvement.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING:</span> Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> Folic acid, especially in doses over 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia associated with vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. Folic acid may lower the serum concentration of phenytoin resulting in increased seizure frequency. Consumption of greater than 3 grams per day of omega-3 fatty acids such as DHA exceeding 2 grams per day is not recommended.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS:</span> Patients should be informed to disclose all medicines, vitamins and supplements used and to take the prescribed dose.
