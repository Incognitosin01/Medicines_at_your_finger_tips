ACTH is a hormone that is normally produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to release the hormones cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones help your body respond to stress and also support many systems of the body including circulation, metabolism, immunity, and the nervous system.</p><p>Cosyntropin is used as part of a medical test called an ACTH stimulation test. This test can help your doctor diagnose adrenal gland disorders such as Addison's disease, Cushing syndrome, or hypopituitarism (failure of the pituitary gland to produce hormones correctly).</p><p>Cosyntropin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before you receive cosyntropin, tell your doctor about all your medical conditions or allergies, and all the medicines you are using.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with cosyntropin if you are allergic to it.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>Before you receive cosyntropin, your blood will be drawn to measure your "baseline" level of certain hormones.</p><p>Your blood will be drawn again 30 to 60 minutes after cosyntropin was injected, to measure your hormone levels and compare them to the baseline levels. This will help your doctor determine if your pituitary and adrenal functions are normal.</p><p>You may need additional medical tests to help your doctor diagnose your condition and determine how best to treat it.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Because you will receive cosyntropin in a clinical setting, you are not likely to miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since  cosyntropin is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving cosyntropin?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Cosyntropin side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Tell your caregivers right away if you have redness, swelling, or hives where the medicine was injected.</p><p>Common side effects may include:</p><ul>
