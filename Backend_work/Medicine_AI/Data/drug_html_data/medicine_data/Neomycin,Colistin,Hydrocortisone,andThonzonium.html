However, because of similarities in chemical structure and/or pharmacologic actions, the possibility of cross-sensitivity cannot be ruled out with certainty.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Otic infections:</b> Otic: Instill 5 drops in affected ear(s) 3 or 4 times daily </p><p><b>Note:</b> Duration of use should be limited to 10 days. Use calibrated dropper provided in packaging.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Otic infections:</b> Children ≥1 year and Adolescents: Otic: Instill 4 drops in affected ear(s) 3 or 4 times daily</p><p><b>Note:</b> Duration of use should be limited to 10 days. Use calibrated dropper provided in packaging.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>For otic use only. Shake otic suspension well before using. Thoroughly cleanse external auditory canal and dry with a sterile cotton applicator. Patient should lie down with affected ear upward and medication instilled. This position should be maintained for 5 minutes to facilitate penetration of the drops. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear. Alternatively, a cotton wick may be inserted into the canal and the cotton may be saturated with the suspension; keep wick moist by adding suspension every 4 hours. Replace wick at least once every 24 hours. Otic preparations should not be used when the integrity of the tympanic membrane is in question (AAP [Rosenfeld 2014]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>There are no known significant interactions.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Frequency not defined. </p><p>Dermatologic: Skin irritation</p><p>Hypersensitivity: Local hypersensitivity reaction</p><p>Otic: Ototoxicity (rare)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Adrenal suppression: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids may cause hypercortisolism or suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, particularly in younger children or in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods. HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis.</p><p>• Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may also increase the incidence of secondary infection, mask acute infection (including fungal infections), prolong or exacerbate viral infections, or limit response to vaccines.</p><p>• Kaposi sarcoma: Prolonged treatment with corticosteroids has been associated with the development of Kaposi sarcoma (case reports); if noted, discontinuation of therapy should be considered (Goedert 2012).</p><p>• Neomycin sensitization: Neomycin may cause cutaneous sensitization (primarily skin rash). Symptoms of neomycin sensitization include itching, low-grade reddening with swelling, dry scaling, itching, and failure to heal. Discontinue immediately if sensitization or irritation occurs.</p><p>• Ototoxicity: Neomycin may cause permanent sensorineural hearing loss due to cochlear damage. Risk of ototoxicity is increased in patients with extended use; limit therapy to 10 days. Do not use in any patient with a perforated tympanic membrane.</p><p>• Systemic effects: Topical corticosteroids may be absorbed percutaneously. Absorption of topical corticosteroids may cause manifestations of Cushing syndrome, hyperglycemia, or glycosuria. Absorption is increased by the use of occlusive dressings, application to denuded skin, or application to large surface areas.</p><p><b><i>Special populations: </i></b></p><p>• Pediatric: Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of corticosteroids after topical application and may be more prone to systemic effects. HPA axis suppression, intracranial hypertension, and Cushing syndrome have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Prolonged use may affect growth velocity; growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For otic use only; do not use in the eyes. If infection is not improved after 1 week, preform cultures and susceptibility tests. Avoid contaminating the bottle tip with material from the ear, fingers, or other source.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Neomycin sensitization (eg, low-grade reddening with swelling, dry scaling, itching, failure to heal)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
