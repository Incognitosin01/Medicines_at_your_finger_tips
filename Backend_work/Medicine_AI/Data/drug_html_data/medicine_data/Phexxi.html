</ul><p><strong>Prepare to Use Phexxi</strong><br/>
<br/>
Keep the pre-filled applicator and plunger rod in the foil pouch until you are ready to use Phexxi.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Step 2: Remove the Pre-filled Applicator and Plunger Rod from the Foil Pouch</strong></p><ul>

<li>Important: Do not remove the pink cap until instructed in Step 4.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Step 3: Insert the Plunger Rod</strong></p><ul>
<li>Gently and slowly insert the plunger rod into the pre-filled applicator. Push until you feel the tip of the plunger rod connect to the inside of the pre-filled applicator.</li>
<li>Do not push hard or continue to push after the tip of the plunger rod connects to the inside of the pre-filled applicator. This could cause the gel to go into the pink cap.</li>
<li>Use a new pre-filled applicator if the gel goes into the pink cap.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Step 4: Remove the Pink Cap</strong></p><ul>
<li>After the plunger rod is connected to the pre-filled applicator, remove the pink cap from the pre-filled applicator.</li>

This can be done sitting with your knees apart, lying on your back with your knees bent, or while standing with your feet apart or knees bent.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Step 6: Insert Phexxi Gel</strong></p><ul>
<li>While the pre-filled applicator is inserted in your vagina, use your index finger to push the plunger rod down until it stops. This is to make sure you<br/>
receive the entire dose of Phexxi.</li>
