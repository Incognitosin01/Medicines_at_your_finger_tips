A DVT can occur after certain types of surgery, or in people who are bed-ridden due to a prolonged illness.</p><p>Dalteparin is also used long-term to treat a type of blood clot called venous thromboembolism (VTE) in people with cancer.</p><p>Dalteparin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use  dalteparin if you have active bleeding, or a low level of platelets in your blood after testing positive for a certain antibody while using dalteparin.</p><p>Dalteparin can cause a very serious blood clot around your spinal cord if you undergo a spinal tap or receive spinal anesthesia (epidural), especially if you have a genetic spinal defect, a history of spinal surgery or repeated spinal taps, or if you are using other drugs that can affect blood clotting, including blood thinners or NSAIDs (ibuprofen, Advil, Aleve, and others).
