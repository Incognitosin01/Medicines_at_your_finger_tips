This is called posterior vitreous detachment. sVMA occurs when small areas of the vitreous remain attached to the retina, causing the retina to pull away from its normal location. sVMA can cause distorted vision, decreased vision, or loss of central vision in severe cases.</p><p>Ocriplasmin ophthalmic may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Call your doctor at once if you have eye pain or redness, changes in vision, or if your eyes are more sensitive to light.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><h2>How is ocriplasmin ophthalmic given?</h2><p>Ocriplasmin ophthalmic is given as an injection into your eye.
