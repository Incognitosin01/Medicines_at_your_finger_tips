Hydroquinone occurs as fine, white needles. The drug is freely soluble in water and in alcohol. Chemically, hydroquinone is designated as p-dihydroxybenzene; the empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">6</span>H<span class="Sub">6</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>; molecular weight is 110.11 g/mol. The chemical structure is in diagram to right.</p><h2>Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Topical application of hydroquinone produces a reversible depigmentation of the skin by inhibition of the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine to 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and suppression of other melanocyte metabolic processes. Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light will cause repigmentation of the bleached areas, which may be prevented by the use of sunblocking agents or sunscreen agents contained in the Obagi-C Rx System Sun Shield Matte Broad Spectrum SPF 50.</p><h2>Indications and Usage</h2><p class="First">The gradual bleaching of hyperpigmented skin conditions such as chloasma, melasma, freckles, senile lentigines, and other unwanted areas of melanin hyperpigmentation.</p><h2>Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">A thin application should be applied once or twice daily or as directed by a physician. If no improvement is seen after three (3) months of treatment, use of this product should be discontinued. Sun exposure should be limited by using a sunscreen agent, a sunblocking agent, or protective clothing to cover bleached skin when using and after using this product in order to prevent darkening from reoccuring.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(also see WARNINGS)</span></p><p>Treatment should be limited to relatively small areas of the body at one time since some patients experience a transient skin reddening and a mild burning sensation, which does not preclude treatment.</p><h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with topical hydroquinone. It is also not known whether hydroquinone can cause fetal harm when used topically on a pregnant woman or affect reproductive capacity. It is not known to what degree, if any, topical hydroquinone is absorbed systemically. Topical hydroquinone should be used on pregnant women only when clearly indicated.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether topical hydroquinone is absorbed or excreted in human milk. Caution is advised when topical hydroquinone is used by a nursing mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Usage</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 years have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">No systemic adverse reactions have been reported. Occasional hypersensitivity (localized contact dermatitis) may occur, in which case the product should be discontinued and physician notified immediately.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">People with prior history of sensitivity or allergic reaction to this product or any of its ingredients should not use it. The safety of topical hydroquinone use during pregnancy or in children (12 years and under) has not been established.</p><h2>How Supplied</h2><p class="First">Store at controlled room temperature: 15°C-25°C (59°F-77°F).
