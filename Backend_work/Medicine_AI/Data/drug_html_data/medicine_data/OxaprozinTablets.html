</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Oxaprozin Tablets</h2><p class="First">Oxaprozin Tablets are indicated:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>For relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis</li>
<li>For relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis</li>
<li>For relief of the signs and symptoms of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</li>
</ul><h2>Oxaprozin Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Dosing Instructions</h3><p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Oxaprozin Tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use Oxaprozin Tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5)]</span>.</p><h3>Osteoarthritis</h3><p class="First">For OA, the dosage is 1200 mg (two 600 mg tablets) given orally once a day <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Dosage and</span> <span class="Italics">Administration (2.5)</span>]</span>.</p><h3>Rheumatoid Arthritis</h3><p class="First">For RA, the dosage is 1200 mg (two 600 mg tablets) given orally once a day <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Dosage and</span> <span class="Italics">Administration (2.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis</h3><p class="First">For JRA, in patients 6 to 16 years of age, the recommended dosage given orally once per day should be based on body weight of the patient as given in Table 1 <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1.          Recommended Daily Dose of Oxaprozin Tablets by Body Weight in Pediatric Patients</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Body Weight Range (kg)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose (mg)</span></p><p class="First">22 to 31</p><p class="First">600</p><p class="First">32 to 54</p><p class="First">900</p><p class="First">≥55</p><p class="First">1200</p><h3>Individualization of Dosage</h3><p class="First">After observing the response to initial therapy with Oxaprozin Tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient’s needs. In osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the dosage should be individualized to the lowest effective dose of Oxaprozin Tablets to minimize adverse effects. The maximum recommended total daily dose of Oxaprozin Tablets in adults is 1800 mg (26 mg/kg, whichever is <span class="Italics">lower</span>) in divided doses. In children, doses greater than 1200 mg have not been studied.</p><p>Patients with low body weight should initiate therapy with 600 mg once daily. Patients with severe renal impairment or on dialysis should also initiate therapy with 600 mg once daily. If there is insufficient relief of symptoms in such patients, the dose may be cautiously increased to 1200 mg, but only with close monitoring <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>In adults, in cases where a quick onset of action is important, the pharmacokinetics of Oxaprozin Tablets allows therapy to be started with a one-time loading dose of 1200 mg to 1800 mg (not to exceed 26 mg/kg). Doses larger than 1200 mg/day on a chronic basis should be reserved for patients who weigh more than 50 kg, have normal renal and hepatic function, are at low risk of peptic ulcer, and whose severity of disease justifies maximal therapy. Physicians should ensure that patients are tolerating doses in the 600 mg/day to 1200 mg/day range without gastroenterologic, renal, hepatic, or dermatologic adverse effects before advancing to the larger doses. Most patients will tolerate once-a-day dosing with Oxaprozin Tablets, although divided doses may be tried in patients unable to tolerate single doses.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Oxaprozin Tablets USP, 600 mg are supplied as white, capsule-shaped, beveled edged, biconvex, film-coated tablets, debossed with "AA59" on one side and scored on the other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Oxaprozin is contraindicated in the following patients:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions) to oxaprozin or any components of the drug product <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.9)].</span></li>
<li>History of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, sometimes fatal, anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics"> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> (5.7, 5.8)</span><span class="Italics">].</span></li>
<li>In the setting of CABG surgery <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span></span> <span class="Italics">(5.1)</span><span class="Italics">].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p><p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as oxaprozin, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> (5.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</span></p><p>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Post-MI Patients</span></p><p>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</p><p>Avoid the use of oxaprozin in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If oxaprozin is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. </p><h3>Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</span></p><p>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-times increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</p><p><span class="Bold">Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated Patients:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.</li>
<li>Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.</li>
<li>Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.</li>
<li>Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.</li>
<li>If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue oxaprozin until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.</li>
<li>In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</li>
</ul><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.</p><p>Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including oxaprozin.</p><p>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash), discontinue oxaprozin immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. </p><p>Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><h3>Heart Failure and Edema</h3><p class="First">The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</p><p>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of oxaprozin may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>Avoid the use of oxaprozin in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If oxaprozin is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Toxicity</span></p><p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.</p><p>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of oxaprozin in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of oxaprozin may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.</p><p>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating oxaprozin. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of oxaprozin <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span> Avoid the use of oxaprozin in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If oxaprozin is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Oxaprozin has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to oxaprozin and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span>.</p><p>Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, oxaprozin is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. When oxaprozin is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of oxaprozin at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Oxaprozin is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">Oxaprozin may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with oxaprozin has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.</p><p>NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span> <span class="Italics">(7)</span>]</span>.</p><h3>Masking of Inflammation and Fever</h3><p class="First">The pharmacological activity of oxaprozin in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><h3>Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Photosensitivity</h3><p class="First">Oxaprozin has been associated with rash and/or mild photosensitivity in dermatologic testing. An increased incidence of rash on sun-exposed skin was seen in some patients in the clinical trials.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Adverse reaction data were derived from patients who received oxaprozin in multidose, controlled, and open-label clinical trials. Rates for events from clinical trial experience are based on 2253 patients who took 1200 mg to 1800 mg oxaprozin per day in clinical trials. Of these, 1721 patients were treated for at least 1 month, 971 patients for at least 3 months, and 366 patients for more than 1 year.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Incidence Greater than 1%</span>:</span></span> In clinical trials of oxaprozin or in patients taking other NSAIDs, the following adverse reactions occurred at an incidence greater than 1%.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular system:</span></span> edema.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">D</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">i</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">g</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">e</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">st</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">i</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">v</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">e system:</span></span> abdominal pain/distress, anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, gastrointestinal ulcers (gastric/duodenal), gross bleeding/perforation, heartburn, liver enzyme elevations, nausea, vomiting.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hematologic system:</span></span> anemia, increased bleeding time.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nervous system:</span></span> CNS inhibition (depression, sedation, somnolence, or confusion), disturbance of sleep, dizziness, headache.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Skin and appendages:</span></span> pruritus, rash.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Special senses:</span></span> tinnitus.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Urogenital system:</span></span> abnormal renal function, dysuria or frequency.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Incidence Greater than 1%</span></span><span class="Bold">:</span> The following adverse reactions were reported in clinical trials or in patients taking other NSAIDs.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Body as a whole</span></span><span class="Bold">:</span> appetite changes, death, drug hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, fever, infection, sepsis<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular system</span></span><span class="Bold">:</span> arrhythmia, blood pressure changes, congestive heart failure, hypertension, hypotension, myocardial infarction, palpitations, tachycardia, syncope, vasculitis.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Digestive system</span></span><span class="Bold">:</span> alteration in taste, dry mouth, eructation, esophagitis, gastritis, glossitis, hematemesis, jaundice, liver function abnormalities including  liver failure, stomatitis, hemorrhoidal or rectal bleeding<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hematologic system</span></span><span class="Bold">:</span> aplastic anemia, ecchymoses, eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, lymphadenopathy, melena, purpura, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolic system</span></span><span class="Bold">:</span> hyperglycemia, weight changes.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nervous system</span></span><span class="Bold">:</span> anxiety, asthenia, coma, convulsions, dream abnormalities, drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, malaise, meningitis, nervousness, paresthesia, tremors, vertigo, weakness.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Respiratory system</span></span><span class="Bold">:</span> asthma, dyspnea, pulmonary infections, pneumonia, sinusitis, symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory depression.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Skin</span></span><span class="Bold">:</span> alopecia, angioedema, urticaria, photosensitivity, sweat.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Special senses</span></span><span class="Bold">:</span> blurred vision, conjunctivitis, hearing decrease.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Urogenital</span></span><span class="Bold">:</span> cystitis, hematuria, increase in menstrual flow, oliguria/ polyuria, proteinuria, renal insufficiency, decreased menstrual flow.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of oxaprozin.

Avoid use of NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester).</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of oxaprozin in pregnant women.</p><p>Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2% to 4% for major malformations, and 15% to 20% for pregnancy loss. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of oxaprozin to pregnant rabbits at doses 0.1-times the maximum daily human dose (based on body surface area) resulted in evidence of teratogenicity; however, oral administration of oxaprozin to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose revealed no evidence of teratogenicity or embryotoxicity. In rat reproduction studies in which oxaprozin was administered through late gestation failure to deliver and a reduction in live birth index was observed at doses equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as oxaprozin, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Labor or Delivery</span></p><p>There are no studies on the effects of oxaprozin during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including oxaprozin, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal data</span></p><p>Teratology studies with oxaprozin were performed in mice, rats, and rabbits in pregnant animals administered oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day, 200 mg/kg/day, and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis. In rabbits, malformations were observed at doses greater than or equal to 7.5 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin (0.1 times the maximum recommended human daily dose [MRHD] of 1800 mg based on body surface area). However, in mice and rats, no drug-related developmental abnormalities or embryo-fetal toxicity were observed at doses up to 50 and 200 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin, respectively (0.1 times and 1.1 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 1800 mg based on a body surface area comparison, respectively).</p><p>In fertility/reproductive studies in rats, 200 mg/kg/day oxaprozin was orally administered to female rats for 14 days prior to mating through lactation day (LD) 2, or from gestation day (GD) 15 through LD 2 and the females were mated with males treated with 200 mg/kg/day oxaprozin for 60 days prior to mating. Oxaprozin administration resulted in failure to deliver and a reduction in live birth index at 200 mg/kg/day (1.1-times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 1800 mg based on a body surface area comparison).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Lactation studies have not been conducted with oxaprozin. It is not known whether oxaprozin is excreted in human milk. Oxaprozin should be administered to lactating women only if clearly indicated. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for oxaprozin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the oxaprozin or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Females</span></p><p>Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. <span class="Italics"><br/></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Males</span></p><p>Testicular degeneration was observed in beagle dogs treated with 37.5 mg/kg/day (0.7-times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area) of oxaprozin for 42 days or 6 months <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of oxaprozin in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years of age have not been established. The effectiveness of oxaprozin for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) in pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, and is based on an extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy of oxaprozin in adults with rheumatoid arthritis and the similarity in the course of the disease and the drug’s mechanism of effect between these two patient populations. Use of oxaprozin in JRA patients 6 to 16 years of age is also supported by the following pediatric studies.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic profile and tolerability of oxaprozin were assessed in JRA patients relative to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients in a 14 day multiple dose pharmacokinetic study. Apparent clearance of unbound oxaprozin in JRA patients was reduced compared to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, but this reduction could be accounted for by differences in body weight <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. No pharmacokinetic data are available for pediatric patients under 6 years. Adverse events were reported by approximately 45% of JRA patients versus an approximate 30% incidence of adverse events in the adult rheumatoid arthritis patient cohort. Most of the adverse events were related to the gastrointestinal tract and were mild to moderate.</p><p>In a 3 month open label study, 10 to 20 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin were administered to 59 JRA patients. Adverse events were reported by 58% of JRA patients. Most of those reported were generally mild to moderate, tolerated by the patients, and did not interfere with continuing treatment. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most frequently reported adverse effects and occurred at a higher incidence than those historically seen in controlled studies in adults. Fifty-two patients completed 3 months of treatment with a mean daily dose of 20 mg/kg. Of 30 patients who continued treatment (19 to 48 week range total treatment duration), nine (30%) experienced rash on sun-exposed areas of the skin and 5 of those discontinued treatment. Controlled clinical trials with oxaprozin in pediatric patients have not been conducted. </p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.13)]</span>.</p><p>No adjustment of the dose of oxaprozin is necessary in the elderly, although many elderly may need to receive a reduced dose because of low body weight or disorders associated with aging <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Of the total number of subjects evaluated in four placebo controlled clinical studies of oxaprozin, 39% were 65 and over, and 11% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Although selected elderly patients in controlled clinical trials tolerated oxaprozin as well as younger patients, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly.</p><p>Oxaprozin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to oxaprozin may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>. </p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6)]</span>.</p><p>Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</p><p>For additional information about overdosage treatment contact a poison control center (1-800-222­-1222).</p><h2>Oxaprozin Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Oxaprozin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, available as tablets of 600 mg for oral administration. The chemical name is 4,5-diphenyl-2-oxazole-propionic acid. The molecular weight is 293. Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">15</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span>, and it has the following chemical structure.</p><p> </p><p>Oxaprozin is a white to off-white powder with a slight odor and a melting point of 162°C to 163°C. It is slightly soluble in alcohol and insoluble in water, with an octanol/water partition coefficient of 4.8 at physiologic pH (7.4). The pKa in water is 4.3.</p><p>Oxaprozin oral tablets, USP contain 600 mg of oxaprozin, USP.</p><p>The inactive ingredients in Oxaprozin Tablets, USP are hypromellose, magnesium stearate, methylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, polacrilin potassium, polyethylene glycol, pregelatinized starch and titanium dioxide.</p><h2>Oxaprozin Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Oxaprozin has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.</p><p>The mechanism of action of oxaprozin, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</p><p>Oxaprozin is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Oxaprozin concentrations reached during therapy have produced <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because oxaprozin is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. </p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General Pharmacokinetic Characteristics</span></p><p>In dose proportionality studies utilizing 600 mg, 1200 mg and 1800 mg doses, the pharmacokinetics of oxaprozin in healthy subjects demonstrated nonlinear kinetics of both the total and unbound drug in opposite directions, i.e. dose exposure related increase in the clearance of total drug and decrease in the clearance of the unbound drug. Decreased clearance of the unbound drug was related predominantly to a decrease in the volume of distribution of the unbound drug and not an increase in the elimination half-life. This phenomenon is considered to have minimal impact on drug accumulation upon multiple dosing. The pharmacokinetic parameters of oxaprozin in healthy subjects receiving a single dose or multiple once-daily doses of 1200 mg are presented in Table 3.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3.

Oxaprozin is 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. At therapeutic drug concentrations, the plasma protein binding of oxaprozin is saturable, resulting in a higher proportion of the free drug as the total drug concentration is increased. With increases in single doses or following multiple once-daily dosing, the apparent volume of distribution and clearance of total drug increased, while that of unbound drug decreased due to the effects of nonlinear protein binding.</p><p>Oxaprozin penetrates into synovial tissues of rheumatoid arthritis patients with oxaprozin concentrations 2-fold and 3-fold greater than in plasma and synovial fluid, respectively.

At these doses there was a trend (over all trials) for oxaprozin to be more effective and cause fewer gastrointestinal side effects than aspirin.</p><p>Oxaprozin was given as a once-a-day dose of 1200 mg in most of the clinical trials, but larger doses (up to 26 mg/kg or 1800 mg/day) were used in selected patients. In some patients, oxaprozin may be better tolerated in divided doses. Due to its long half-life, several days of oxaprozin therapy were needed for the drug to reach its full effect <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>. </p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Oxaprozin Tablets USP, <span class="Bold">600 mg</span> are supplied as white, capsule-shaped, beveled edged, biconvex, film-coated tablets, debossed with “AA59” on one side and scored on the other side.</p><p>They are available as follows:</p><p>Bottle of 100 Tablets:                        NDC 69238-1120-1<br/>
