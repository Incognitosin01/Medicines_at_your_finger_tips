Tacrine will not cure Alzheimer's disease, and it will not stop the disease from getting worse. However, tacrine can improve thinking ability in some patients with Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>In Alzheimer's disease, many chemical changes take place in the brain. One of the earliest and biggest changes is that there is less of a chemical messenger called acetylcholine (ACh). ACh helps the brain to work properly. Tacrine slows the breakdown of ACh, so it can build up and have a greater effect. However, as Alzheimer's disease gets worse, there will be less and less ACh, so tacrine may not work as well.</p><p>Tacrine may cause liver problems. While taking tacrine, you must have blood tests regularly to see if the medicine is affecting your liver.</p><p>Tacrine was available only with your doctor's prescription. Tacrine (Cognex®) was withdrawn from the US market in May 2012.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using tacrine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
