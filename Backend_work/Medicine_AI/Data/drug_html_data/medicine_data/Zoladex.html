Goserelin overstimulates the body's own production of certain hormones, which causes that production to shut down temporarily.</p><p>Zoladex implants are used to treat symptoms of prostate cancer in men.</p><p>The Zoladex implant is used in women to treat breast cancer or endometriosis. Zoladex is also used in women to prepare the lining of the uterus for endometrial ablation (a surgery to correct abnormal uterine bleeding).</p><p>Zoladex is sometimes used in combination with another cancer drug called flutamide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Goserelin can harm an unborn baby or cause birth defects. Unless you are being treated for advanced breast cancer, you should not use Zoladex during pregnancy. Use effective non-hormonal (barrier) birth control during treatment and for at least 12 weeks after treatment ends. Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant during treatment. You should not breast-feed while you are using Zoladex.</p><p>You should not use Zoladex if you are allergic to goserelin or to similar hormone medications such as leuprolide (Lupron, Eligard, Viadur), nafarelin (Synarel), or ganirelix (Antagon).</p><p>Before you receive Zoladex, tell your doctor if you have osteoporosis, diabetes, urination problems, a condition affecting your spine, a history of heart attack or stroke, risk factors for coronary artery disease (such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, or being overweight), or if you have abnormal bleeding that your doctor has not checked.</p><p>Zoladex can decrease bone mineral density, which may increase your risk of developing osteoporosis. This risk may be greater if you smoke, drink alcohol frequently, have a family history of osteoporosis, or use certain drugs such as seizure medications or steroids. Talk to your doctor about your individual risk of bone loss.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have a serious side effect while using Zoladex, such as severe numbness or tingling in your legs or feet, muscle weakness, problems with balance or coordination, loss of bladder or bowel control, urinating less than usual, pain or burning when you urinate, blood in your urine or stools, easy bruising, increased thirst or urination, fruity breath odor, trouble breathing, sudden numbness or weakness, sudden severe headache, confusion, problems with vision or speech, or chest pain spreading to the arm or shoulder</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with Zoladex implants if you are allergic to goserelin, or to similar hormone medications such as histrelin, leuprolide, nafarelin, or ganirelix.</p><p>This medicine can harm an unborn baby, but goserelin is sometimes used in pregnant women with advanced breast cancer. <b>Unless you are being treated for advanced breast cancer, you should not use Zoladex during pregnancy.</b> You may need to have a negative pregnancy test before starting this treatment.</p><p>If you have not gone through menopause, you should use a nonhormonal form of birth control (condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, contraceptive sponge) to prevent pregnancy while the Zoladex implant is in place.</p><p><b>Keep using birth control for at least 12 weeks after the implant was removed.</b> Even though the Zoladex implant can stop ovulation and menstrual periods, you could still become pregnant.</p><p>To make sure Zoladex is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Talk to your doctor about your individual risk.</p><p>You should not breastfeed while the implant is in place.</p><h2>How is Zoladex given?</h2><p>Zoladex is given in a tiny implant inserted through a needle into the skin of your stomach, once every 28 days. You will receive the implant in a clinic or doctor's office.</p><p>Your dosing schedule may be different if you are also receiving chemotherapy. Follow your doctor's instructions. It is very important to receive your Zoladex implant injections on time each month.</p><p>You are not likely to be able to feel the implant through your skin, and it should not cause pain or discomfort. The implant will dissolve in your body over time.</p><p>While your hormone levels are adjusting, you may notice new or worsening symptoms of your condition during the first few weeks of treatment. <b>Tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve after several weeks.</b></p><p>If you are a premenopausal woman, you should stop having menstrual periods while the Zoladex implant is in place. <b>Call your doctor if you still have regular periods.</b> Missing a dose can cause breakthrough bleeding. After you stop using Zoladex, you should begin having regular periods within 12 weeks.</p><p>Your blood sugar may need to be checked while using Zoladex, even if you are not diabetic.</p><p>Goserelin can cause unusual results with certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using Zoladex.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Prostate Cancer:</b></p><p>For the palliative treatment of advanced carcinoma of the prostate:<br/>
