All GI incidences were categorized as “mild” and no patients discontinued due to adverse events. Allergic reactions have not been reported following the use of oral sodium polysulthionate.</p><p>Sulfur, by itself, is not toxic to our bodies. However, some people are allergic to relatives of sulfur such as sulfites and sulfa drugs. Certain sulfites can trigger asthma and other allergic reactions in people who are sensitive. Tell your health care provider if you think you may be allergic to sulfur-containing substances.</p><p>Folic acid, when administered in daily doses above 0.1mg, may obscure the detection of B12 deficiency (specifically, the administration of folic acid may reverse the hematological manifestations of B12 deficiency, including pernicious anemia, while not addressing the neurological manifestations). Folate therapy alone is inadequate for the treatment of a B12 deficiency.</p><p><span class="Bold">INTERACTIONS WITH DRUGS:</span><br/>

No decrease in effectiveness of drugs has been reported with the use of Sodium Polysulthionate and Folic Acid.<br/>
Hydrogen sulfide may induce cytochrome P450 2B67 and 2E18, therefore it may decrease the half-life of medications metabolized by these enzymes. Careful monitoring of concomitant medications metabolized by these enzymes is recommended.</p><p><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS:</span><br/>
Mild gastrointestinal (GI) issues such as flatulence and nausea were observed in sodium polysulthionate patients.

The highest level of sodium polysulthionate consumption has been 1,600MG per day in clinical studies although anecdotal reports of 3,000mg per day have used without adverse events.</p><h2>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First">The adult dose of SODIUM POLYSULTHIONATE, FOLIC ACID is 1-2 capsules twice a day, or 400–800mg sodium polysulthionate and 1-2 mg folic acid twice per day (BID) or as prescribed by a medical practictioner.

SODIUM POLYSULTHIONATE, FOLIC ACID is a dietary management / prescription (Rx)† nutritional product to be used only under licensed medical supervision and direction. Your licensed medical practitioner may choose to prescribe SODIUM POLYSULTHIONATE, FOLIC ACID along with other medications.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">Sodium polysulthionate: consists of a biologically active sulfur based nutrients in a proprietary matrix of alpha sulfur, sodium sulfate, and sodium thiosulfate derived from food sources. In a study of health controls and heart failure patients, oral sodium polysulthionate increased hydrogens sulfide and nitric oxide levels (p&lt;0.05).</p><p>Folate: folate is essential for the production of certain coenzymes in many metabolic systems such as purine and pyrimidine synthesis. Through one-carbon metabolism folate plays an essential role in homocysteine metabolism. Homocysteine metabolizes in the body to produce hydrogen sulfied, which is a strong antioxidant and vasorelaxation factor. At an elevated level, homocysteine inactivates proteins by homocysteinylation including its endogenous metabolizing enzyme, cystathionine gamma-lyase. Thus, there is a reduced production of endogenous hydrogen sulfide during hyperhomocysteinemia. Folate along with methylcobolamin is an essential co-factor in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine.</p><h2>How is Sodium Polysulthionate and Folic Acid Supplied</h2><p class="First">SODIUM POLYSULTHIONATE, FOLIC ACID is a is a dietary management / folate prescription (Rx)† nutritional product</p><p>SODIUM POLYSULTHIONATE, FOLIC ACID Bottle contains 60 capsules Product Code # 69499-904-60*<br/>
