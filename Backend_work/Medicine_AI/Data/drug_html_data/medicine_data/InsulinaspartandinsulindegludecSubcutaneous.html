</ul><p>Pharmacologic Class: Insulin, Ultra Rapid Acting</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for insulin aspart and insulin degludec</h2><p>Insulin aspart is a fast-acting type of insulin. Insulin degludec is a long-acting type of insulin that works slowly, over about 24 hours. Insulin is one of many hormones that help the body turn the food we eat into energy. This is done by using the glucose (sugar) in the blood as quick energy. Also, insulin helps us store energy that we can use later. When you have diabetes mellitus, your body cannot make enough insulin or does not use insulin properly. This causes you to have too much sugar in your blood. Like other types of insulin, insulin aspart and insulin degludec combination is used to keep your blood sugar level close to normal.</p><p>Insulin aspart and insulin degludec is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using insulin aspart and insulin degludec</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

For insulin aspart and insulin degludec, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to insulin aspart and insulin degludec or any other medicines.

Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 1 year of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of insulin aspart and insulin degludec combination in the elderly.
