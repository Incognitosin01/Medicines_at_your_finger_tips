</ul><h2>WARNIGNS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of Colprep Kit. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking Colprep Kit, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment.</p><p>Patients with electrolyte abnormalities should have them corrected before treatment with Colprep Kit. In addition, use caution when prescribing Colprep Kit for patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment. <span class="Italics">[See Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span></p><p>Colprep Kit can cause temporary elevations in uric acid. <span class="Italics">[See Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Uric acid fluctuations in patients with gout may precipitate an acute flare. The potential for uric acid elevation should be considered before administering Colprep Kit to patients with gout or other disorders of uric acid metabolism.</p><h3>Cardiac Arrhythmias</h3><p class="First">There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing Colprep Kit for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.</p><p>Use caution when prescribing Colprep Kit for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Use caution when prescribing Colprep Kit for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration, and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients.</p><h3>Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis</h3><p class="First">Administration of osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and Colprep Kit may increase these risks. The potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation should be considered when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p><h3>Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease</h3><p class="First">If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering Colprep Kit.<br/>
Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.</p><h3>Aspiration</h3><p class="First">Use with caution in patients with impaired gag reflex and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration. Such patients should be observed during administration of Colprep Kit.</p><h3>Not for Direct Ingestion</h3><p class="First">Each bottle must be reconstituted followed by dilution with water to a final volume of 16 ounces and ingestion of 32 ounces of additional water as recommended is important to patient tolerance. Direct ingestion of the undiluted solution may increase the risk of nausea, vomiting, dehydration, and electrolyte disturbances.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.<br/>
The safety of Colprep Kit has been established from adequate and well-controlled trials of another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. Below is a display of the adverse reactions of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) in these adequate and well-controlled studies.<br/>
In a multicenter, controlled clinical trial comparing another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) with a bowel prep containing polyethylene glycol and electrolytes (PEG + E) that were administered in a split-dose (2-day) regimen, the most common adverse reactions after administration of another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) were overall discomfort, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and headache; See Table 1, below.<br/>
Less common adverse reactions occurring were atrioventricular (AV) block (1 case) and creatine kinase (CK) increase. In this study, patients receiving another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) were limited to a light breakfast followed by clear liquids; patients receiving the PEG + E bowel prep were allowed to have a normal breakfast and a light lunch, followed by clear liquids.</p><p></p><p>Table 2 shows the percentages of patients who developed new abnormalities of important electrolytes and uric acid after completing the bowel preparation with either another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g)or PEG+E administered as a split-dose (2-day) regimen.</p><p></p><p>There were also 408 patients who participated in a study in which another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) or PEG+E were administered in an evening-only (1-day) regimen. Higher rates of overall discomfort, abdominal distention, and nausea were observed with the evening-only (1- day) regimen compared to the split-dose (2-day) regimen for both preparations. Patients treated with another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) had increased rates of vomiting with the evening-only (1- day) regimen. An evening-only (1-day) dosing regimen was associated with higher rates of abnormal values for some electrolytes when compared to the split-dose (2-day) regimen for both preparations. For another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g), the evening only (1-day) regimen was associated with higher rates of total bilirubin (high), BUN (high), creatinine (high), osmolality (high), potassium (high) and uric acid (high) than the split dose (2-day) regimen. Administration of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) in an evening-only (1-day) dosing regimen is not recommended.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drugs That May Increase Risks Due to Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Use caution when prescribing Colprep Kit for patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and prolonged QT in the setting of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Consider additional patient evaluations as appropriate <span class="Italics">[See Warnings (5)]</span> in patients taking these concomitant medications.</p><h3>Potential for Altered Drug Absorption</h3><p class="First">Oral medication administered within one hour of the start of each Colprep Kit dose may be flushed from the gastrointestinal tract, and the medication may not be absorbed properly.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Colprep Kit. It is also not known whether Colprep Kit can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Colprep Kit should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Colprep Kit is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Colprep Kit have not been established in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 375 patients who received another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) in clinical trials, 94 (25%) were 65 years of age or older, and 25 (7%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) administered as a split-dose (2-day) regimen were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients. Geriatric patients reported more vomiting when sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) was given as a one- day preparation.</p><h2>Colprep Description</h2><p class="First">Colprep Kit (sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate) for oral solution is an osmotic laxative that includes two 200 mL bottles and one 20-ounce mixing container. Each bottle contains 22.7 g of white to off-white granular powder including sodium sulfate 17.5 g, potassium sulfate 3.13 g, and magnesium sulfate 1.6 g and the following inactive ingredients: citric acid anhydrous, sucralose, and lemon flavor.</p><p></p><h2>Colprep - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Sulfate salts provide sulfate anions, which are poorly absorbed. The osmotic effect of unabsorbed sulfate anions and the associated cations causes water to be retained within the gastrointestinal tract.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The osmotic effect of the unabsorbed ions, when ingested with a large volume of water, produces a copious watery diarrhea.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></span><br/>
After administration of another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) in six healthy subjects, the time at which serum sulfate reached its highest point (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) was approximately 17 hours after the first half dose or approximately 5 hours after the second dose.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></span><br/>
Serum sulfate concentrations declined with a half-life of 8.5 hours. The mean sulfate levels returned to baseline level by Day 6 after dose initiation. Fecal excretion was the primary route of sulfate elimination in healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Hepatic and Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The disposition of sulfate after administration of another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) was studied in patients (N=6) with mild-moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grades A and B) and in patients (N=6) with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min). The renal impairment group had the highest serum sulfate AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>, followed by the hepatic impairment group, and then by healthy subjects. The mean sulfate levels of all three groups returned to their respective baseline levels by Day 6 after dose initiation.</p><p>The systemic exposure of serum sulfate (AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) was similar between healthy subjects and patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours, starting after the first half dose, was similar between hepatically impaired patients and healthy subjects.</p><p>In patients with moderate renal impairment, mean AUC and Cmax were 54% and 44% higher than those in healthy subjects, respectively. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours, starting after the first half dose, was approximately 16% lower in moderate renal impairment patients than in healthy subjects.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Colprep Kit. Studies to evaluate the possible impairment of fertility or mutagenic potential of Colprep Kit have not been performed.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">The sulfate salts of sodium, potassium, and magnesium contained in BC Powder for Oral Solution Kit were administered orally (gavage) to rats and dogs up to 28 days up to a maximum daily dose of 5 g/kg/day (approximately 0.9 and 3 times for rats and dogs, respectively, the recommended human dose of 44 g/day or 0.89 g/kg based on the body surface area). In rats, the sulfate salts caused diarrhea and electrolyte and metabolic changes, including hypochloremia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, lower serum osmolality, and high serum bicarbonate. Significant renal changes included increased fractional sodium excretion, increased urinary sodium and potassium excretion, and alkaline urine in both males and females. In addition, creatinine clearance was significantly decreased in females at the highest dose. No microscopic renal changes were seen. In dogs, the sulfate salts caused emesis, excessive salivation, excessive drinking of water, and abnormal excreta (soft and/or mucoid feces and/or diarrhea) and increased urine pH and sodium excretion.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of Colprep Kit has been established based on an adequate, controlled study of another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g). Below is a display of the results of this adequate and well-controlled study.</p><p>The colon cleansing efficacy of another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) was evaluated in a randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study. In this study, 363 adult patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Patients ranged in age from 20 to 84 years (mean age 55 years) and 54% were female. Race distribution was 86% Caucasian, 9% African- American, and 5% other.</p><p>Patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation regimens: another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) or a marketed polyethylene glycol (PEG) bowel prep. In the Study, another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) was administered according to a split-dose preparation regimen <span class="Italics">[See Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>. The PEG bowel prep was also given as a split-dose preparation according to its labeled instructions. Patients receiving another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) were limited to a light breakfast followed by clear liquids on the day prior to the day of colonoscopy; patients receiving the PEG bowel prep were allowed to have a normal breakfast and a light lunch, followed by clear liquids.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing as assessed by the colonoscopists, who were not informed about the type of preparation received. In the study, no clinically or statistically significant differences were seen between the group treated with another oral formulation of sodium sulfate (17.5 g), potassium sulfate (3.13 g), and magnesium sulfate (1.6 g) and the group treated with the PEG bowel prep.
