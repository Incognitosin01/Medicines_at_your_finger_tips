Babies born dependent on opioids may need medical treatment for several weeks.</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using morphine. This medicine can pass into breast milk and cause drowsiness, breathing problems, or death in a nursing baby. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><p>Morphine injection is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is morphine injection given?</h2><p>Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Never use morphine in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if you feel an increased urge to use more of this medicine.</p><p>Morphine is injected into a muscle, or given as an infusion into a vein. Morphine injection is sometimes given with an infusion pump that controls your dosing.</p><p>Morphine is sometimes injected into the space around the spinal cord, or directly into the fluid around the brain and spinal cord. A healthcare provider will give this type of injection in a hospital.</p><p><b>Never share opioid medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it.
