Rubraca is sometimes used for these conditions only if your cancer has a specific genetic marker (an abnormal "BRCA" gene). Your doctor will test you for this gene.</p><p>Rubraca is also used to treat prostate cancer with an abnormal BRCA gene. It is given for this condition when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body and surgery or other cancer treatments did not work or have stopped working.</p><p>Rubraca was approved for prostate cancer by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on an "accelerated" basis. In clinical studies, some people responded to this medicine, but further studies are needed.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Rubraca can cause leukemia or serious bone marrow problems. You may get an infection or bleed more easily. Call your doctor if you have unusual bruising or bleeding, blood in your urine or stools, shortness of breath, or signs of infection (fever, feeling weak or tired, weight loss).</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Using Rubraca may increase your risk of developing serious bone marrow problems or other types of cancer, such as leukemia.
