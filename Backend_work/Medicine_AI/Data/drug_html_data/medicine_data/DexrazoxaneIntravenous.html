This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For dexrazoxane, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to dexrazoxane or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of dexrazoxane injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of dexrazoxane injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving dexrazoxane injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving dexrazoxane, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using dexrazoxane with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>
<li>Dimethyl Sulfoxide</li>
<li>Doxorubicin</li>
<li>Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of dexrazoxane. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Blood disorder or bleeding problem (eg, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)—May make this condition worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Kidney disease—The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Liver disease—Use is not recommended in patients with this condition.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of dexrazoxane</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you dexrazoxane. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. It must also be given slowly, so the needle will have to stay in place for at least 1 hour.</p><p>Dexrazoxane must be injected right away and within 6 hours after tissue damage caused by the leakage of certain cancer medicines for 3 days.</p><p>Dexrazoxane should come with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>If you are using an ice pack or any other cooling procedure at the affected area, you may have to remove it at least 15 minutes before receiving dexrazoxane.</p><h3>Missed dose</h3><p>Dexrazoxane needs to be given on a fixed schedule. If you miss a dose or forget to use your medicine, call your doctor or pharmacist for instructions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using dexrazoxane</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that dexrazoxane is working properly. Blood tests are needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Receiving dexrazoxane while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. It may also cause birth defects if the father is receiving it when his sexual partner becomes pregnant. Female patients should use an effective form of birth control during treatment with dexrazoxane and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Male patients who have female partners should use effective birth control during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving dexrazoxane, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>If you plan to have children, talk with your doctor before using dexrazoxane. Some men receiving dexrazoxane have become infertile (unable to have children).</p><p>Dexrazoxane can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects, such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>Dexrazoxane may cause a serious allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis and angioedema. These can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after receiving dexrazoxane.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Dexrazoxane side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
