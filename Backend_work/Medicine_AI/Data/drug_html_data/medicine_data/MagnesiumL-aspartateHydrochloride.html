Management: Consider using a non-magnesium-containing antacid or phosphate-binding product in patients also receiving alfacalcidol.  If magnesium-containing products must be used with alfacalcidol, serum magnesium concentrations should be monitored closely.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Alpha-Lipoic Acid: Magnesium Salts may decrease the absorption of Alpha-Lipoic Acid. Alpha-Lipoic Acid may decrease the absorption of Magnesium Salts.  Management: Separate administration of alpha-lipoic acid from that of any magnesium-containing compounds by several hours. If alpha-lipoic acid is given 30 minutes before breakfast, then administer oral magnesium-containing products at lunch or dinner.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Baloxavir Marboxil: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of Baloxavir Marboxil. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Bictegravir: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of Bictegravir.  Management: Administer bictegravir under fasting conditions at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after polyvalent cation containing products. Coadministration of bictegravir with or 2 hours after most polyvalent cation products is not recommended.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Bisphosphonate Derivatives: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of Bisphosphonate Derivatives.  Management: Avoid administration of oral medications containing polyvalent cations within: 2 hours before or after tiludronate/clodronate/etidronate; 60 minutes after oral ibandronate; or 30 minutes after alendronate/risedronate.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Calcitriol (Systemic): May increase the serum concentration of Magnesium Salts. Management: Consider using a non-magnesium-containing antacid or phosphate-binding product in patients also receiving calcitriol. If magnesium-containing products must be used with calcitriol, serum magnesium concentrations should be monitored closely.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Calcium Channel Blockers: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Magnesium Salts. Magnesium Salts may enhance the hypotensive effect of Calcium Channel Blockers.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Deferiprone: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of Deferiprone.  Management: Separate administration of deferiprone and oral medications or supplements that contain polyvalent cations by at least 4 hours.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Dolutegravir: Magnesium Salts may decrease the serum concentration of Dolutegravir.  Management: Administer dolutegravir at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after oral magnesium salts. Administer the dolutegravir/rilpivirine combination product at least 4 hours before or 6 hours after oral magnesium salts.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Doxercalciferol: May enhance the hypermagnesemic effect of Magnesium Salts. Management: Consider using a non-magnesium-containing antacid or phosphate-binding product in patients also receiving doxercalciferol. If magnesium-containing products must be used with doxercalciferol, serum magnesium concentrations should be monitored closely.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Eltrombopag: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of Eltrombopag.  Management: Administer eltrombopag at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after oral administration of any polyvalent cation containing product.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Elvitegravir: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of Elvitegravir.

Management: Administer gabapentin at least 2 hours after use of a magnesium-containing antacid. Monitor patients closely for evidence of reduced response to gabapentin therapy. Monitor for CNS depression if high dose IV/epidural magnesium sulfate is used.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Levothyroxine: Magnesium Salts may decrease the serum concentration of Levothyroxine.  Management: Separate administration of oral levothyroxine and oral magnesium salts by at least 4 hours.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Multivitamins/Fluoride (with ADE): Magnesium Salts may decrease the serum concentration of Multivitamins/Fluoride (with ADE). Specifically, magnesium salts may decrease fluoride absorption.  Management: To avoid this potential interaction separate the administration of magnesium salts from administration of a fluoride-containing product by at least 1 hour.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents: Magnesium Salts may enhance the neuromuscular-blocking effect of Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>PenicillAMINE: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of PenicillAMINE.  Management: Separate the administration of penicillamine and oral polyvalent cation containing products by at least 1 hour.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Phosphate Supplements: Magnesium Salts may decrease the serum concentration of Phosphate Supplements.  Management: Administer oral phosphate supplements as far apart from the administration of an oral magnesium salt as possible to minimize the significance of this interaction.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Quinolones: Magnesium Salts may decrease the serum concentration of Quinolones.  Management: Administer oral quinolones several hours before (4 h for moxi/pe/spar/enox-, 2 h for others) or after (8 h for moxi-, 6 h for cipro/dela-, 4 h for lome/pe/enox-, 3 h for gemi-, and 2 h for levo-, nor-, or ofloxacin or nalidixic acid) oral magnesium salts.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Raltegravir: Magnesium Salts may decrease the serum concentration of Raltegravir.  Management: Avoid the use of oral / enteral magnesium salts with raltegravir. No dose separation schedule has been established that adequately reduces the magnitude of interaction.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Tetracyclines: Magnesium Salts may decrease the absorption of Tetracyclines. Only applicable to oral preparations of each agent.  Management: Avoid coadministration of oral magnesium salts and oral tetracyclines. If coadministration cannot be avoided, administer oral magnesium at least 2 hours before, or 4 hours after, oral tetracyclines. Monitor for decreased tetracycline therapeutic effects.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Trientine: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of Trientine.  Management: Avoid concomitant administration of trientine and oral products that contain polyvalent cations. If oral iron supplements are required, separate the administration by 2 hours.
