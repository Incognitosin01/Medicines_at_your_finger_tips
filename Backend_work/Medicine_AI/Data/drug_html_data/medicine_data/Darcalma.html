Indicated for the relief of local symptoms, such as inflammation, hypermotility, and pain, which accompany lower urinary tract infections. Indicated for the relief of urinary tract symptoms caused by diagnostic procedures.</p><h2>Darcalma Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">FOR ORAL USE ONLY</p><p>Adults: One tablet 4 times per day by mouth, followed by liberal fluid intake.<br/>
Older Children: Dosage must be individualized by physician.<br/>
Not recommended for use in children younger than six years.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Darcalma is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to any of its ingredients. Risk benefits should be carefully considered when the following medical problems exist: achalasia of esophagus, atony of colon, diseases of cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal hemorrhage; glaucoma; hemolytic anemia from pyruvate kinase and G6PD deficiencies, infected urolithiasis, myasthenia gravis, paralytic ileus, severe ulcerative colitis, toxic megacolon; acute urinary retention may be precipitated in obstructive uropathy (such as bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy).</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><p class="First">Do not exceed recommended dosage. This drug may make you dizzy or drowsy or cause blurred vision; use caution while driving, using machinery, or doing any activity that requires alertness or clear vision. Limit alcohol consumption. Cross sensitivity and/or related problems – patients intolerant of belladonna alkaloids or salicylates may be intolerant of this medication also. Delay in gastric emptying could complicate the management of gastric ulcers. There have been no studies to establish the safety of prolonged use of this product in humans. No known long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Cardiovascular: rapid heartbeat, flushing<br/>
Central Nervous System: blurred vision, dizziness, drowsiness<br/>
Genitourinary: difficulty micturition, acute urinary retention<br/>
Gastrointestinal: dry mouth, nausea and vomiting<br/>
Respiratory: shortness of breath or trouble breathing<br/>
<br/>
Serious allergic reactions to this drug are rare. Seek immediate medical attention if you notice symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including itching, rash, severe dizziness, swelling or trouble breathing.<br/>
<br/>
This medication can cause urine and sometimes stools to turn blue-green. This effect is harmless and will subside after medication is stopped.<br/>
<br/>
Call your doctor or physician for medical advice about side effects. The following number does not provide medical advice, but in the U.S. you may report suspected side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">This drug should not be used with the following medications because very serious interactions may occur: live influenza virus vaccine, pramlintide. Because of this product's effect on gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying, it may decrease the absorption of other oral medications during concurrent use such as: urinary alkalizers; thiazide diuretics (may cause the urine to become alkaline reducing the effectiveness of Methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde); antimuscarinics (concurrent use may intensify antimuscarinic effects of Hyoscyamine Sulfate because of secondary antimuscarinic activities of these medications); antacids/antidiarrheals (may reduce absorption of Hyoscyamine Sulfate, concurrent use with antacids may cause urine to become alkaline, reducing effectiveness of Methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde). Doses of these medications should be spaced 1 hour apart from doses of Hyoscyamine Sulfate; antimyasthenics (concurrent use with Hyoscyamine Sulfate may further reduce intestinal motility); ketoconazole (patients should be advised to take this combination at least 2 hours after ketoconazole); monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use may intensify antimuscarinic side effects), opioid (narcotic analgesics may result in increased risk of severe constipation); sulfonamides (these drugs may precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine, increasing the danger of crystalluria). This is not a complete list of all drug interactions. Tell your doctor or pharmacist of all prescription medications prior to use.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><p class="First">A dependence on the use of Darcalma has not been reported nor expected based on the pharmacology of the ingredients contained in Darcalma.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">By exceeding the recommended dosage of Darcalma, symptomology related to the overdose of its individual active ingredients may be expected as follows:<br/></p><p>Hyoscyamine Sulfate: Symptoms associated with overdosage of Darcalma will most probably be manifested in the symptoms related to overdosage of alkaloid Hyoscyamine Sulfate. Such symptoms as dryness of mucous membranes; dilation of pupils, hot, dry, flushed skin; hyperpyrexia; tachycardia; palpitations; elevated blood pressure; coma; circulatory collapse and death from respiratory failure can occur due to overdosage of these alkaloids.</p><h2>How is Darcalma Supplied</h2><p class="First">Darcalma is available as a blue tablet, imprinted "RE 287": bottles of 100 tablets, NDC 68032-287-10.
