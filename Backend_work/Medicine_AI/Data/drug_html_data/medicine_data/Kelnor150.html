Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations in the genital tract, including changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which may reduce the likelihood of implantation) may also contribute to contraceptive effectiveness.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Kelnor 1/50</h2><p class="First">Kelnor 1/50 is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy in women who elect to use oral contraceptives as a method of contraception. Oral contraceptive products such as Kelnor 1/50, which contain 50 mcg of estrogen, should not be used unless medically indicated.</p><p>Oral contraceptives are highly effective. <span class="Bold">Table 1</span> lists the typical accidental pregnancy rates for users of combination oral contraceptives and other methods of contraception. The efficacy of these contraceptive methods, except sterilization and progestogen implants and injections, depends upon the reliability with which they are used.

</ul><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from oral contraceptive use. This risk increases with age and with heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives should be strongly advised not to smoke.</span></p><p class="First">The use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risk of several serious conditions including venous and arterial thromboembolism, thrombotic and hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, liver tumors or other liver lesions, and gallbladder disease. The risk of morbidity and mortality increases significantly in the presence of other risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Practitioners prescribing oral contraceptives should be familiar with the following information relating to these and other risks.</p><p>The information contained herein is principally based on studies carried out in patients who used oral contraceptives with formulations containing higher amounts of estrogens and progestogens than those in common use today. The effect of long-term use of the oral contraceptives with lesser amounts of both estrogens and progestogens remains to be determined.</p><p>Throughout this labeling, epidemiological studies reported are of two types: retrospective case-control studies and prospective cohort studies. Case-control studies provide an estimate of the relative risk of a disease, which is defined as the <span class="Italics">ratio</span> of the incidence of a disease among oral contraceptive users to that among nonusers. The relative risk (or odds ratio) does not provide information about the actual clinical occurrence of a disease. Cohort studies provide a measure of both the relative risk and the attributable risk. The latter is the <span class="Italics">difference</span> in the incidence of disease between oral contraceptive users and nonusers. The attributable risk does provide information about the actual occurrence or incidence of a disease in the subject population. For further information, the reader is referred to a text on epidemiological methods.</p><h3>1. Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems</h3><p class="First">An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been associated with oral contraceptive use.<span class="Sup">2-21</span> This increased risk is primarily in smokers or in women with other underlying risk factors for coronary artery disease such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. The relative risk for myocardial infarction in current oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be 2 to 6. The risk is very low under the age of 30. However, there is the possibility of a risk of cardiovascular disease even in very young women who take oral contraceptives.</p><p>Smoking in combination with oral contraceptive use has been reported to contribute substantially to the risk of myocardial infarction in women in their mid-thirties or older, with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases.<span class="Sup">22</span> Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown to increase substantially in smokers, especially in those 35 years of age and older among women who use oral contraceptives (see <span class="Bold">Figure 1</span>, <span class="Bold">Table 2</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1. Circulatory disease mortality rates per 100,000 woman-years by age, smoking status, and oral contraceptive use.<span class="Sup">14</span></span></p><p>Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, hypercholesterolemia, age, cigarette smoking, and obesity. In particular, some progestogens decrease HDL cholesterol<span class="Sup">23-31</span> and cause glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism.<span class="Sup">32</span> Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure among some users (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>, <span class="Bold">No. 10</span>). Similar effects on risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease.</p><p class="First">An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of oral contraceptives is well established.<span class="Sup">17, 33-51</span> Case-control studies have estimated the relative risk to be 3 for the first episode of superficial venous thrombosis, 4 to 11 for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and 1.5 to 6 for women with predisposing conditions for venous thromboembolic disease.<span class="Sup">34-37, 45, 46</span> Cohort studies have shown the relative risk to be somewhat lower, about 3 for new cases (subjects with no past history of venous thrombosis or varicose veins) and about 4.5 for new cases requiring hospitalization.<span class="Sup">42, 47, 48</span> The risk of venous thromboembolic disease associated with oral contraceptives is not related to duration of use.</p><p>A two- to seven-fold increase in relative risk of postoperative thromboembolic complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives.<span class="Sup">38, 39</span> The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is about twice that of women without such medical conditions.<span class="Sup">43</span> If feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to and for 2 weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, and also during and following prolonged immobilization. Since the immediate postpartum period is also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than 4 to 6 weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breastfeed.</p><p class="First">Both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes) have been reported to be increased with oral contraceptive use,<span class="Sup">14, 17, 18, 34, 42, 46, 52-59</span> although, in general, the risk was greatest among older (over 35 years), hypertensive women who also smoked. Hypertension was reported to be a risk factor for both users and nonusers, for both types of strokes, while smoking increased the risk for hemorrhagic strokes.</p><p>In one large study,<span class="Sup">52</span> the relative risk for thrombotic stroke was reported as 9.5 times greater in users than in nonusers. It ranged from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension.<span class="Sup">54</span> The relative risk for hemorrhagic stroke was reported to be 1.2 for nonsmokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.9 to 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 6.1 to 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users, and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension. The risk is also greater in older women and among smokers.</p><p class="First">A positive association has been reported between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease.<span class="Sup">41, 43, 53, 59-64</span> A decline in serum high density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestogens.<span class="Sup">23-31</span> A decline in serum high density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease.<span class="Sup">65</span> Because estrogens increase HDL-cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on the balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogens used in the contraceptives. The amount of both steroids should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.</p><p>Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen-progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one that contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptives should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content that produces satisfactory results in the individual.</p><p>Products containing 50 mcg estrogen should be used only when medically indicated.</p><p class="First">There are three studies that have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for users of oral contraceptives. In a study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persisted for at least 9 years for women 40 to 49 years old who had used oral contraceptives for 5 or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups.<span class="Sup">16</span> Another American study reported former use of oral contraceptives was significantly associated with increased risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage.<span class="Sup">57</span> In another study, in Great Britain, the risk of developing non-rheumatic heart disease plus hypertension, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis, and transient ischemic attacks persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although the excess risk was small.<span class="Sup">14, 18, 66</span> It should be noted that these studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 mcg or more of estrogens.</p><h3>2. Estimates of Mortality From Contraceptive Use</h3><p class="First">One study<span class="Sup">67</span> gathered data from a variety of sources that have estimated the mortality rates associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (<span class="Bold">Table 2</span>). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that, with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 or older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with childbirth. The observation of a possible increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970’s, but not reported until 1983.<span class="Sup">67</span> However, current clinical practice involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations combined with careful restriction of oral contraceptive use to women who do not have the various risk factors listed in this labeling.</p><p>Because of these changes in practice and, also, because of some limited new data that suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the use of oral contraceptives may now be less than previously observed,<span class="Sup">48, 152</span> the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the topic in 1989. The Committee concluded that, although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy nonsmoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures that may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception.</p><p>Therefore, the Committee recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy nonsmoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks. Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take the lowest possible dose formulation that is effective.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Table 2: Annual number of birth-related or method-related deaths associated with control of fertility per 100,000 nonsterile women, by fertility control method according to age.<span class="Sup">67</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Age</span></p><p class="First">Method of Control</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">15 to 19</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">20 to 24</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">25 to 29</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">30 to 34</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">35 to 39</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">40 to 44</span></p><p class="First">No fertility control methods*</p><p class="First">7.0</p><p class="First">7.4</p><p class="First">9.1</p><p class="First">14.8</p><p class="First">25.7</p><p class="First">28.2</p><p class="First">Oral contraceptives</p><p class="First">nonsmoker†</p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">0.9</p><p class="First">1.9</p><p class="First">13.8</p><p class="First">31.6</p><p class="First">smoker†</p><p class="First">2.2</p><p class="First">3.4</p><p class="First">6.6</p><p class="First">13.5</p><p class="First">51.1</p><p class="First">117.2</p><p class="First">IUD†</p><p class="First">0.8</p><p class="First">0.8</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">Condom*</p><p class="First">1.1</p><p class="First">1.6</p><p class="First">0.7</p><p class="First">0.2</p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Diaphragm/Spermicide*</p><p class="First">1.9</p><p class="First">1.2</p><p class="First">1.2</p><p class="First">1.3</p><p class="First">2.2</p><p class="First">2.8</p><p class="First">Periodic abstinence*</p><p class="First">2.5</p><p class="First">1.6</p><p class="First">1.6</p><p class="First">1.7</p><p class="First">2.9</p><p class="First">3.6</p><p>Adapted from Ory.<span class="Sup">67</span></p><h3>3. Carcinoma of the Breast and Reproductive Organs</h3><p class="First">Numerous epidemiological studies have been performed on the incidence of breast, endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancer in women using oral contraceptives. While there are conflicting reports, many studies suggest that the use of oral contraceptives is not associated with an overall increase in the risk of developing breast cancer.<span class="Sup">17, 40, 68-78</span> Other studies, however, have reported an increased risk overall,<span class="Sup">153-155</span> or in certain subgroups. In these studies, increased risk has been associated with long duration of use, use beginning at a young age, use before the first term pregnancy, use by those who had an early menarche, those who had a positive family history of breast cancer, or in nulliparas.<span class="Sup">79-102, 151, 156-162</span> These risks have been surveyed in two books<span class="Sup">163-164</span> and in review articles.<span class="Sup">85, 99, 153, 165-167</span></p><p>Some studies suggested that oral contraceptive use was associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, dysplasia, erosion, carcinoma, or micro-glandular dysplasia in some populations of women.<span class="Sup">17, 50, 103-115</span> However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</p><p>In spite of many studies of the relationship between oral contraceptive use and breast and cervical cancers, a cause and effect relationship has not been established.</p><h3>4. Hepatic Neoplasia</h3><p class="First">Benign hepatic adenomas and other hepatic lesions have been associated with oral contraceptive use,<span class="Sup">116-121</span> although the incidence of such benign tumors is rare in the United States. Indirect calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3 cases per 100,000 for users, a risk that increases after 4 or more years of use.<span class="Sup">120</span> Rupture of benign, hepatic adenomas or other lesions may cause death through intraabdominal hemorrhage. Therefore, such lesions should be considered in women presenting with abdominal pain and tenderness, abdominal mass, or shock. About one quarter of the cases presented because of abdominal masses; up to one half had signs and symptoms of acute intraperitoneal hemorrhage.<span class="Sup">121</span> Diagnosis may prove difficult.</p><p>Studies from the U.S.,<span class="Sup">122, 150</span> Great Britain,<span class="Sup">123, 124</span> and Italy<span class="Sup">125</span> have shown an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt;8 years; relative risk of 7 to 20) oral contraceptive users. However, these cancers are rare in the United States, and the attributable risk (the excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral contraceptive users approaches less than 1 per 1,000,000 users.</p><h3>5. Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment</h3><p class="First">During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as COCs. Discontinue Kelnor prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Kelnor can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the combination drug regimen.</p><h3>6. Ocular Lesions</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of retinal thrombosis and other ocular lesions associated with the use of oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives should be discontinued if there is unexplained, gradual or sudden, partial or complete loss of vision; onset of proptosis or diplopia; papilledema; or any evidence of retinal vascular lesions. Appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures should be undertaken immediately.</p><h3>7. Oral Contraceptive Use Before or During Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy.<span class="Sup">126, 129</span> The majority of recent studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly insofar as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned,<span class="Sup">126-129</span> when the pill is taken inadvertently during early pregnancy.</p><p>The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy. Oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion. It is recommended that for any patient who has missed two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing oral contraceptive use. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and further use of oral contraceptives should be withheld until pregnancy has been ruled out. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.</p><h3>8. Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">Earlier studies reported an increased lifetime relative risk of gallbladder surgery in users of oral contraceptives and estrogens.<span class="Sup">40, 42, 53, 70</span> More recent studies, however, have shown that the relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among oral contraceptive users may be minimal.<span class="Sup">130-132</span> The recent findings of minimal risk may be related to the use of oral contraceptive formulations containing lower doses of estrogens and progestogens.</p><h3>9. Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</h3><p class="First">Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause a decrease in glucose tolerance in a significant percentage of users.<span class="Sup">32</span> This effect has been shown to be directly related to estrogen dose.<span class="Sup">133</span> Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, the effect varying with different progestational agents.<span class="Sup">32, 134</span> However, in the nondiabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose. Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully observed while taking oral contraceptives.</p><p>Some women may have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill. As discussed earlier (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>, <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">1a</span></span> and <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">1d</span></span>), changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive users.<span class="Sup">23-31, 135, 136</span></p><h3>10. Elevated Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives<span class="Sup">50, 53, 137-139</span> and this increase is more likely in older oral contraceptive users<span class="Sup">137</span> and with extended duration of use.<span class="Sup">53</span> Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners<span class="Sup">138</span> and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestogens.</p><p>Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related disease, or renal disease<span class="Sup">139</span> should be encouraged to use another method of contraception. If such women elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely and if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should be discontinued. For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives,<span class="Sup">137</span> and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension among ever- and never-users.<span class="Sup">140</span></p><h3>11. Headache</h3><p class="First">The onset or exacerbation of migraine or the development of headache of a new pattern that is recurrent, persistent, or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.</p><h3>12. Bleeding Irregularities</h3><p class="First">Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. Nonhormonal causes should be considered and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If a pathologic basis has been excluded, time alone or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>1. Physical Examination and Follow-Up</h3><p class="First">It is good medical practice for all women to have annual history and physical examinations, including women using oral contraceptives. The physical examination, however, may be deferred until after initiation of oral contraceptives if requested by the woman and judged appropriate by the clinician. The physical examination should include special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen, and pelvic organs, including cervical cytology, and relevant laboratory tests. In case of undiagnosed, persistent, or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care.</p><h3>2. Lipid Disorders</h3><p class="First">Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult.</p><h3>3. Liver Function</h3><p class="First">If jaundice develops in any woman receiving oral contraceptives, they should be discontinued. Steroids may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function and should be administered with caution in such patients. Cholestatic jaundice has been reported after combined treatment with oral contraceptives and troleandomycin. Hepatotoxicity following a combination of oral contraceptives and cyclosporine has also been reported.</p><h3>4. Fluid Retention</h3><p class="First">Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions that might be aggravated by fluid retention, such as convulsive disorders, migraine syndrome, asthma, or cardiac, hepatic, or renal dysfunction.</p><h3>5. Emotional Disorders</h3><p class="First">Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.</p><h3>6. Contact Lenses</h3><p class="First">Contact lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance should be assessed by an ophthalmologist.</p><h3>7. Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Reduced efficacy and increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding and menstrual irregularities have been associated with concomitant use of rifampin. A similar association, though less marked, has been suggested for barbiturates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin sodium, and possibly with griseofulvin, ampicillin, and tetracyclines. Administration of troglitazone concomitantly with a combination oral contraceptive (estrogen and progestin) reduced the plasma concentrations of both hormones by approximately 30%. This could result in loss of contraceptive efficacy.</p><p><span class="Italics">Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy – Liver Enzyme Elevation</span></p><p>Do not co-administer Kelnor with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations (see WARNINGS, Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment).</p><h3>8. Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">Certain endocrine and liver function tests and blood components may be affected by oral contraceptives:</p><h3>9. Carcinogenesis</h3><p class="First">See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.</p><h3>10. Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category X</span></p><p>(See <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span> and <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.)</p><h3>11. Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids have been identified in the milk of nursing mothers<span class="Sup">141-143</span> and a few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including jaundice and breast enlargement. In addition, oral contraceptives given in the postpartum period may interfere with lactation by decreasing the quantity and quality of breast milk. If possible, the nursing mother should be advised not to use oral contraceptives, but to use other forms of contraception until she has completely weaned her child.</p><h3>12. Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of Kelnor has been established in women of reproductive age. Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 16 and for users 16 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated.</p><h3>13. Venereal Diseases</h3><p class="First">Oral contraceptives are of no value in the prevention or treatment of venereal disease. The prevalence of cervical <span class="Italics">Chlamydia trachomatis</span> and <span class="Italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span> in oral contraceptive users is increased several-fold.<span class="Sup">144, 145</span> It should not be assumed that oral contraceptives afford protection against pelvic inflammatory disease from chlamydia.<span class="Sup">144</span> Patients should be counseled that this product does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.</p><h3>14. General</h3><p class="First">a. The pathologist should be advised of oral contraceptive therapy when relevant specimens are submitted.</p><p>b. Treatment with oral contraceptives may mask the onset of the climacteric. (See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> regarding risks in this age group.)</p><h2>INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT</h2><p class="First">See patient labeling printed below.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">An increased risk of the following serious adverse reactions has been associated with the use of oral contraceptives (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>):</p><ul class="Disk">

</ul><h2>Kelnor 1/50 Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, oral contraceptives must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals of 24 hours.</p><p>IMPORTANT: If the Sunday start schedule is selected, the patient should be instructed to use an additional method of protection until after the first week of administration <span class="Italics">in the initial cycle.</span></p><p>The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of use should be considered.</p><p><span class="Bold">Kelnor 1/50 (28 Day Regimen) (ethynodiol diacetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets)</span></p><h3>Dosage Schedule</h3><p class="First">The Kelnor 1/50 28 day regimen tablet dispenser contains 21 pink colored active tablets arranged in three numbered rows of 7 tablets each, followed by a fourth row of 7 white placebo tablets.</p><p>Days of the week are printed above the tablets, starting with Sunday on the left.</p><h3>28-Day Schedule</h3><p class="First">For a DAY 1 START, count the first day of menstrual flow as Day 1 and the first tablet (pink) is then taken on Day 1. For a SUNDAY START when menstrual flow begins on or before Sunday, the first tablet (pink) is taken on that day. With either a DAY 1 START or SUNDAY START, 1 tablet (pink) is taken each day at the same time for 21 days. Then the white tablets are taken for 7 days, whether bleeding has stopped or not. After all 28 tablets have been taken, whether bleeding has stopped or not, the same dosage schedule is repeated beginning on the following day.</p><h3>Special Notes</h3><p class="First">If spotting (bleeding insufficient to require a pad), breakthrough bleeding (heavier bleeding similar to a menstrual flow), or nausea occurs the patient should continue taking her tablets as directed. The incidence of spotting, breakthrough bleeding or nausea is minimal, most frequently occurring in the first cycle. Ordinarily spotting or breakthrough bleeding will stop within a week. Usually the patient will begin to cycle regularly within two to three courses of tablet-taking. In the event of spotting or breakthrough bleeding organic causes should be borne in mind. (See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>, <span class="Bold">No. 12</span>.)</p><p class="First">Withdrawal flow will normally occur 2 or 3 days after the last active tablet is taken. Failure of withdrawal bleeding ordinarily does not mean that the patient is pregnant, providing the dosage schedule has been correctly followed. (See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>, <span class="Bold">No. 7</span>.)</p><p>If the patient has <span class="Italics">not</span> adhered to the prescribed dosage regimen, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered after the first missed period, and oral contraceptives should be withheld until pregnancy has been ruled out.</p><p>If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing the contraceptive regimen.</p><p>The first intermenstrual interval after discontinuing the tablets is usually prolonged; consequently, a patient for whom a 28-day cycle is usual might not begin to menstruate for 35 days or longer. Ovulation in such prolonged cycles will occur correspondingly later in the cycle. Post-treatment cycles after the first one, however, are usually typical for the individual woman prior to taking tablets. (See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>, <span class="Bold">No. 12</span>.)</p><p class="First">If a woman misses taking one active tablet, the missed tablet should be taken as soon as it is remembered. In addition, the next tablet should be taken at the usual time. If two consecutive active tablets are missed in week 1 or week 2 of the dispenser, the dosage should be doubled for the next 2 days. The regular schedule should then be resumed, but an additional method of protection must be used as backup for the next 7 days if she has sex during that time or she may become pregnant.</p><p>If two consecutive active tablets are missed in week 3 of the dispenser or three consecutive active tablets are missed during any of the first 3 weeks of the dispenser, direct the patient to do one of the following: Day 1 Starters should discard the rest of the dispenser and begin a new dispenser that same day; Sunday Starters should continue to take 1 tablet daily until Sunday, discard the rest of the dispenser and begin a new dispenser that same day. The patient may not have a period this month; however, if she has missed two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out. An additional method of protection must be used as a backup for the next 7 days after the tablets are missed if she has sex during that time or she may become pregnant.</p><p>While there is little likelihood of ovulation if only one active tablet is missed, the possibility of spotting or breakthrough bleeding is increased and should be expected if two or more successive active tablets are missed. However, the possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day that scheduled active tablets are missed.</p><p>If one or more placebo tablets of Kelnor 1/50 are missed, the Kelnor 1/50 schedule should be resumed on the eighth day after the last pink colored tablet was taken. Omission of placebo tablets in the 28 tablet courses does not increase the possibility of conception provided that this schedule is followed.</p><h2>How is Kelnor 1/50 Supplied</h2><p class="First">Kelnor<span class="Sup">®</span> 1/50 (28 Day Regimen) (ethynodiol diacetate and ethinyl estradiol USP): Each pink Kelnor 1/50 tablet is round in shape, unscored, debossed with WATSON 384 and contains 1 mg of ethynodiol diacetate, USP and 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol, USP.</p><p>Kelnor 1/50 is packaged in cartons of six (NDC 0093-8073-16) tablet dispensers.

It does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious adverse effects on the heart and blood vessels from oral contraceptive use. This risk increases with age and with heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives are strongly advised not to smoke.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">In the detailed leaflet, "What You Should Know About Oral Contraceptives," which you have received, the risks and benefits of oral contraceptives are discussed in much more detail. That leaflet also provides information on other forms of contraception. <span class="Bold">Please take time to read it carefully for it may have been recently revised.</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">If you have any questions or problems regarding this information, contact your doctor.</span></p><p>Oral contraceptives, also known as “birth control pills” or “the pill,” are taken to prevent pregnancy and, when taken correctly, have a failure rate of about 1% per year when used without missing any pills. The typical failure rate of large numbers of pill users is less than 3% per year when women who miss pills are included. However, forgetting to take pills considerably increases the chances of pregnancy.</p><p>For most women, oral contraceptives are free of serious or unpleasant side effects. However, oral contraceptive use is associated with certain serious diseases or conditions that can cause severe disability or death, though rarely. There are some women who are at high risk of developing certain serious diseases that can be life-threatening or may cause temporary or permanent disability. The risks associated with taking oral contraceptives increase significantly if you:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>smoke, or</li>
<li>have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or are overweight, or</li>
<li>have or have had clotting disorders, heart attack, stroke, angina pectoris (chest pains on exertion), cancer of the breast or sex organs, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes), or malignant (cancerous) or benign (noncancerous) liver tumors.</li>
</ul><p>Women should not use oral contraceptives if they suspect they are pregnant or if they have unexplained vaginal bleeding.</p><p>Most side effects of the pill are not serious. The most common effects are nausea, vomiting, bleeding between menstrual periods, weight gain, breast tenderness, and difficulty wearing contact lenses. These side effects, especially nausea and vomiting, may subside within the first three months of use.</p><p>Proper use of oral contraceptives requires that they be taken under your doctor's continuing supervision, because they can be associated with serious side effects. The serious side effects of the pill occur very infrequently, especially if you are in good health and are young. However, you should know that the following medical conditions have been associated with or made worse by the pill, and that certain of the risks may persist after use of the pill has been discontinued:</p><p>The symptoms associated with these serious side effects are discussed in the detailed leaflet given to you with your supply of pills. Notify your doctor or healthcare provider if you notice any unusual physical disturbances while taking the pill. In addition, you should be aware that drugs such as antiepileptics, antibiotics (especially rifampin), as well as certain other drugs, may decrease oral contraceptive effectiveness.</p><p>There is a conflict among studies regarding breast cancer and oral contraceptive use. Some studies have reported an increase in the risk of developing breast cancer, particularly at a younger age. This increased risk appears to be related to duration of use. The majority of studies have found no overall increase in the risk of developing breast cancer. Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives. There is insufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that pills may cause such cancers.</p><p>Taking the pill may provide some important non-contraceptive benefits. These include less painful menstruation, less menstrual blood loss and anemia, less risk of fibroids, pelvic infections, and noncancerous breast disease, and less risk of cancer of the ovary and of the lining of the uterus (womb).</p><p>Be sure to discuss any medical condition you may have with your healthcare provider. He or she will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will also examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the healthcare provider believes that it is a good medical practice to postpone it. You should be re-examined at least once a year while taking oral contraceptives. The detailed patient information leaflet gives you further information that you should read and discuss with your healthcare provider.</p><p><span class="Bold">DETAILED PATIENT LABELING</span></p><p><span class="Bold">This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy.

Although the oral contraceptives have important advantages over other methods of contraception, they have certain risks that no other method has. Only you and your physician can decide whether the advantages are worth these risks. This leaflet will tell you about the most important risks. It will explain how you can help your doctor prescribe the pill as safely as possible by telling him/her about yourself and being alert for the earliest signs of trouble. And it will tell you how to use the pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. THERE IS MORE DETAILED INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THE LEAFLET PREPARED FOR DOCTORS. Your pharmacist can show you a copy; you may need your doctor's help in understanding parts of it.</p><p>This leaflet is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your healthcare provider. You should discuss the information provided in this leaflet with him or her, both when you first start taking the pill and during your revisits. You should also follow your healthcare provider's advice with regard to regular check-ups while you are on the pill.</p><p>If you do not have any of the conditions listed below and are thinking about using oral contraceptives, to help you decide, you need information about the advantages and risks of oral contraceptives and of other contraceptive methods as well. This leaflet describes the advantages and risks of oral contraceptives. Except for sterilization, the intrauterine device (IUD), and abortion, which have their own specific risks, the only risks of other methods are those due to pregnancy should the method fail. Your doctor can answer questions you may have with respect to other methods of contraception, and further questions you may have on oral contraceptives after reading this leaflet.</p><p><span class="Bold">WHAT ARE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES?</span></p><p>The most common type of oral contraceptive, often simply called “the pill,” is a combination of estrogen and progestogen, the two kinds of female hormones. The amount of estrogen and progestogen can vary, but the amount of estrogen is more important because both the effectiveness and some of the dangers of the pill have been related to the amount of estrogen. The pill works principally by preventing release of an egg from the ovary during the cycle in which the pills are taken.</p><p><span class="Bold">EFFECTIVENESS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES</span></p><p>The pill is one of the most effective methods of birth control. When they are taken correctly, without missing any pills, the chance of becoming pregnant is less than 1% (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use) when used perfectly, without missing any pills. Typical failure rates are actually about 3% per year. The chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill during a menstrual cycle.</p><p>In comparison, typical failure rates for other methods of birth control during the first year of use are as follows:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">% of women experiencing an</span></p><p><span class="Bold">unintended pregnancy</span></p><p><span class="Bold">within the first year of use</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">% of women</span></p><p><span class="Bold">continuing use</span></p><p><span class="Bold">at one year</span>*<span class="Bold"> </span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Method</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(1)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Typical Use</span>†</p><p><span class="Bold">(2)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Perfect Use</span>‡</p><p><span class="Bold">(3)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(4)</span></p><p class="First">Chance§</p><p class="First">85</p><p class="First">85</p><p class="First">Spermicides¶</p><p class="First">26</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">40</p><p class="First">Periodic abstinence</p><p class="First">25</p><p class="First">63</p><p class="First">Calendar</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">Ovulation method</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">Sympto-thermal#</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">Post-ovulation</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">Withdrawal</p><p class="First">19</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">CapÞ</p><p class="First">Parous women</p><p class="First">40</p><p class="First">26</p><p class="First">42</p><p class="First">Nulliparous women</p><p class="First">20</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">56</p><p class="First">Sponge</p><p class="First">Parous women</p><p class="First">40</p><p class="First">20</p><p class="First">42</p><p class="First">Nulliparous women</p><p class="First">20</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">56</p><p class="First">DiaphragmÞ</p><p class="First">20</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">56</p><p class="First">Condomß</p><p class="First">Female (Reality<span class="Sup">®</span>)</p><p class="First">21</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">56</p><p class="First">Male</p><p class="First">14</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">61</p><p class="First">Pill</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">71</p><p class="First">Progestin only</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">Combined</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First">IUD</p><p class="First">Progesterone T</p><p class="First">2.0</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">81</p><p class="First">Copper T 380A</p><p class="First">0.8</p><p class="First">0.6</p><p class="First">78</p><p class="First">LNg 20</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First">81</p><p class="First">Injection (Depo-Provera<span class="Sup">®</span>)</p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">70</p><p class="First">Implant (Norplant<span class="Sup">®</span> and Norplant-2<span class="Sup">®</span>)</p><p class="First">0.05</p><p class="First">0.05</p><p class="First">88</p><p class="First">Female sterilization</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">100</p><p class="First">Male sterilization</p><p class="First">0.15</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First">100</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Emergency Contraceptive Pills:</span> Treatment initiated within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse reduces the risk of pregnancy by at least 75%.à </p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Lactational Amenorrhea Method:</span> LAM is a highly effective, <span class="Italics">temporary</span> method of contraception.è</p><p class="First">Source: Trussell J, Contraceptive efficacy.

It can be seen in the table that for women aged 15 to 39, the risk of death was highest with pregnancy (7 to 26 deaths per 100,000 women, depending on age). Among pill users who do not smoke, the risk of death was always lower than that associated with pregnancy for any age group, although over the age of 40, the risk increases to 32 deaths per 100,000 women, compared to 28 associated with pregnancy at that age. However, for pill users who smoke and are over the age of 35, the estimated number of deaths exceeds those for other methods of birth control. If a woman is over the age of 40 and smokes, her estimated risk of death is four times higher (117/100,000 women) than the estimated risk associated with pregnancy (28/100,000) in that age group.</p><p>The suggestion that women over 40 who don't smoke should not take oral contraceptives is based on information from older high-dose pills and on less selective use of pills than is practiced today. An Advisory Committee of the FDA discussed this issue in 1989 and recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy, nonsmoking women over 40 years of age may outweigh the possible risks. However, all women, especially older women, are cautioned to use the lowest dose pill that is effective.</p><p><span class="Bold">WARNING SIGNALS</span></p><p>If any of these adverse effects occur while you are taking oral contraceptives, call your doctor immediately:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Sharp chest pain, coughing up blood, or sudden shortness of breath (indicating a possible blood clot in the lung).</li>
<li>Pain in the calf (indicating a possible blood clot in the leg).</li>
<li>Crushing chest pain or heaviness in the chest (indicating a possible heart attack).</li>
<li>Sudden severe headache or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, disturbances of vision or speech, or numbness in an arm or leg (indicating a possible stroke).</li>
<li>Sudden partial or complete loss of vision (indicating a possible blood clot in the blood vessels of the eye).</li>
<li>Breast lumps (indicating possible breast cancer or fibrocystic disease of the breast). Ask your doctor or healthcare provider to show you how to examine your own breasts.</li>
<li>Severe pain or tenderness or a mass in the stomach area (indicating a possible ruptured liver tumor)</li>
<li>Difficulty in sleeping, weakness, lack of energy, fatigue, or change in mood (possibly indicating severe depression).</li>

In case of overdosage, contact your healthcare provider, pharmacist, or Poison Control Center.</p><p><span class="Bold">OTHER INFORMATION</span></p><p>Your healthcare provider will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will also examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the healthcare provider believes that it is a good medical practice to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year. Certain health problems or conditions in your medical or family history may require that your healthcare provider see you more frequently while you are taking the pill. Be sure to keep all appointments with your healthcare provider because this is a time to determine if there are early signs of side effects of oral contraceptive use.</p><p>Do not use the drug for any condition other than the one for which it was prescribed. This drug has been prescribed specifically for you; do not give it to others who may want birth control pills.</p><p>This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy.

They are:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Menstrual cycles may become more regular</li>
<li>Blood flow during menstruation may be lighter and less iron may be lost. Therefore, anemia due to iron deficiency is less likely to occur</li>

<li>Ectopic (tubal) pregnancy may occur less frequently</li>
<li>Noncancerous cysts or lumps in the breast may occur less frequently</li>
<li>Acute pelvic inflammatory disease may occur less frequently</li>
<li>Fibroids of the uterus (womb) may occur less frequently</li>
