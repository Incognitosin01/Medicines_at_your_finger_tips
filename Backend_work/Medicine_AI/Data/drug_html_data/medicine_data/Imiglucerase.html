It is used as an enzyme replacement in people with Type I Gaucher disease.</p><p>Gaucher disease is a genetic condition in which the body lacks the enzyme needed to break down certain fatty materials (lipids). Lipids can build up in the body, causing symptoms such as easy bruising or bleeding, weakness, anemia, bone or joint pain, enlarged liver or spleen, or weakened bones that are easily fractured.</p><p>Imiglucerase may improve the condition of the liver, spleen, bones, and blood cells in people with Type I Gaucher disease.
