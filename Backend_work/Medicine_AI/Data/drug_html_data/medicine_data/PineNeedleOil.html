Et Zucc., Pinus sylvestris L.<br/><b>Common Name(s):</b> Pine needle oil</p><h2>Clinical Overview</h2><h3>Use</h3><p>Medical literature documents antibacterial, antioxidant, antifungal, and wound-healing pharmacological activities for pine needle oil. However, clinical studies in support of these recommendations are limited.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>Pine needle oil is available commercially in many products. It is marketed for numerous health conditions and for aromatherapy use. Pine needle tea is also marketed as an overall panacea.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Avoid use with hypersensitivity to any of the components of pine needle oil.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Lactation</h3><p>Avoid use due to documented adverse effects.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>None well documented.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>Limited clinical data are available. Tolerability of a topical preparation with pine needle oil as an ingredient was excellent. Adverse effects included hypersensitivity reactions of the skin and mucous membranes as well as cough. Allergic contact dermatitis from various pine needle oil fragrance components has also been documented.</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>Information is lacking.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Pinaceae</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>The Pinaceae family includes more than 250 species mainly distributed in the Northern Hemisphere and in subtropical and tropical portions of Central America and Asia.Ioannou 2014, Kurose 2007, Yu 2004 Many species can grow to 30 m tall or more in height as sturdy trees. The evergreen needles, up to 12 cm in length, contain resin, and the pollen cones are conical and elongate and usually appear in the spring. Soft pines have 1 fibrovascular bundle for structural support, with 5 needles per bundle. However, hard pines have 2 fibrovascular bundles with 2 to 5 needles per bundle.Ioannou 2014</p><h2>History</h2><p>In China and Korea, pine needles are used to promote health and are consumed as food and dietary supplements.Kim 2010, Kurose 2007, Yu 2004 A 2004 economic study documents consumption of pine needles in Korea as 1,000 tons per year. Pine-based commercial products are found in beverages, candy, tea, and wine.Yu 2004 In China and Korea, pine needles are used as herbal medicine and in tea for their nutritional and pharmaceutical effects.Ka 2005, Zeng 2012 In China, Japan, India, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Lapland, pine needle extract is used to treat various skin ailments, including burns.Clark 2014 Pine needle oils are commercially used as ingredients in several types of soaps, perfumes, and deodorants.Ka 2005, Kurose 2007</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Chemical analysis of pine needles from 46 pine species revealed more than 190 constituents. Nearly every sample contained monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes. The monoterpene hydrocarbons alpha- and beta-pinene and the sesquiterpene germacrene D are the dominant constituents.Ioannou 2014, Kurose 2007 A mixture of piperidine alkaloids from spruce needles (Picea abies) have confirmed teratogenic activity.Tawara 1993</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>Limited clinical studies are available. However, the literature documents antibacterial,Feng 2010, Kamin 2007, Krauze-Baranowska 2002, Zeng 2011, Zeng 2012 antioxidant,Ka 2005, Park 2011 antifungal,Feng 2010, Kamin 2007, Krauze-Baranowska 2002, Zeng 2011, Zeng 2012 and wound-healingClark 2014 activities for pine needle oil.</p><h3>Antibacterial and antifungal activity</h3><p>Although gentamicin was more effective, pine needle oil showed inhibitory activity against the bacteria Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus cereus, as well as the fungi Aspergillus niger, Penicillium citrinum, Rhizopus oryzae, and Aspergillus flavus.Zeng 2012 Another study documented similar antibacterial activity for food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria as well as for Micrococcus luteus and Proteus vulgaris.Feng 2010 Antifungal activity is also documented against Fusarium culmorum, Fursarium solani, and Fusarium poae.Krauze-Baranowska 2002 Pine needle oil in combination with ascorbic acid inhibited tissue browning and reduced microbial growth on fresh-cut apple slices.Zeng 2011</p><p>Pinimenthol ointment contains eucalyptus, pine needle oil, and menthol. A postmarketing observational study of 3,060 patients suffering from upper respiratory tract infections concluded that treatment with Pinimenthol ointment was well tolerated. Two other main outcome measures were incidence of adverse drug reactions and adverse events, with 10 patients reporting hypersensitivity reactions of the skin and 6 reporting cough.Kamin 2007</p><h3>Other uses</h3><p>In vitro data studies found antioxidant activity for pine needle oil against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated brain neuroblastoma cellsKa 2005 and 1,1-dihenyl-1-picryhydrazl radical scavenging activity.Park 2011</p><p>In vitro studies showed that alpha-pinene in pine needle oil inhibited BEL-7402 cells by blocking cell growth in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, down-regulating Cdc25C mRNA and protein expression, and reducing cycle dependence on kinase 1(CDK1) activity.Chen 2014</p><p>Pine needle oil supplementation significantly reduced body weight gain and visceral fat mass in rats treated with a high-fat diet. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, and leptin levels in plasma were also reduced. Histological findings also documented reduced fatty liver tissue or steatosis.Jeon 2006, Jeon 2013</p><p>Pine needle oil reduced dermal ear inflammation and a second-degree scald paw burn in a mouse. The oil counteracted the tactile pain (by blocking pain transmission or activation of calcium channels by adenosine triphosphate) and soft tissue injury caused by the burn.Clark 2014</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Pine needle oil is available commercially in many products and marketed for numerous health conditions and for aromatherapy use.</p><p>Pine needle tea is also marketed as an overall panacea. More than 29 flavor compounds have been identified in pine needle tea,Kim 2000 including alpha-pinene, isoamyl alcohol, trans-caryophyllene, terpinene-4-ol, alpha-terpineol, and delta-cadinene.</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use due to documented adverse effects.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>Data are lacking concerning specific drug interactions.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Limited clinical data are available. Tolerability of a topical preparation with pine needle oil as an ingredient was excellent. Adverse effects included hypersensitivity reactions of the skin and mucous membranes as well as cough.Kamin 2007 Allergic contact dermatitis from various pine needle oil fragrance components has also been documented.Nardelli 2009</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Avoid use with hypersensitivity to any of the components of pine needle oil.</p><p>Alkaloids from pine and spruce needles have confirmed teratogenic activity in pregnant range cows.Tawara 1993, Virjamo 2014</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
