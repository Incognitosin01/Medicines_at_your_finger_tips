An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic.</p><p>Nucynta is used to treat moderate to severe pain.</p><p>Nucynta ER is an extended-release form of tapentadol and is used for around-the-clock treatment of pain that is not controlled by other medicines. This form of tapentadol is not for use on an as-needed basis for pain.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Do not use Nucynta if you have used a MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days. A dangerous drug interaction could occur. MAO inhibitors include isocarboxazid, linezolid, methylene blue injection, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, or tranylcypromine.</p><p>You should not use Nucynta if you have severe breathing problems, or a bowel obstruction called paralytic ileus.</p><p>Tapentadol can slow or stop your breathing, especially when you start using this medicine or whenever your dose is changed. Never take Nucynta in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Do not crush, break, or open an extended-release tablet. Swallow it whole to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal dose.</p><p>Tapentadol may be habit-forming, even at regular doses. <b>Take this medicine exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Never share the medicine with another person. MISUSE OF NARCOTIC PAIN MEDICATION CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b></p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant. <b>Tapentadol may cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in a newborn if the mother has taken this medicine during pregnancy.</b></p><p>Fatal side effects can occur if you use Nucynta with alcohol, or with other drugs that cause drowsiness or slow your breathing.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Nucynta if you are allergic to tapentadol, or if you have:</p><ul>

Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Never use this medicine in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if you feel an increased urge to take more of this medicine.</p><p><b>Never share opioid medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it.

Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine.</p><p>Never crush or break a Nucynta pill to inhale the powder or mix it into a liquid to inject the drug into your vein.
