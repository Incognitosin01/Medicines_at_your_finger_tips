If combined, monitor for increased substrate effects.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Dabrafenib: May decrease the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inducers). Management: Seek alternatives to concomitant therapy when possible.  If concomitant therapy cannot be avoided, monitor for reduced clinical effects of the CYP3A4 substrate.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Deferasirox: May decrease the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inducers).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Duvelisib: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Enzalutamide: May decrease the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inducers).

Consider discontinuing if allergic reactions occur.</p><p>• Retinal vascular thrombosis: May cause retinal vascular thrombosis; discontinue pending examination if migraine, loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, or other visual disturbances occur; discontinue permanently if papilledema or retinal vascular lesions are observed on examination.</p><p>• Thromboembolism: Discontinue if arterial thrombosis, DVT, or thromboembolic events occur. Use is contraindicated with current or history of thrombosis or thromboembolic disorders.</p><p><b><i>Disease related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Carbohydrate intolerance: May have adverse effects on glucose tolerance; use caution in women with prediabetes and diabetes.</p><p>• Depression: Use with caution in patients with depression; discontinue if depression occurs.</p><p>• Diseases exacerbated by fluid retention: Use with caution in patients with diseases that may be exacerbated by fluid retention, including asthma, epilepsy, preeclampsia, cardiac or renal dysfunction.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Specific studies have not been conducted; elimination may be decreased. Use is contraindicated with hepatic impairment.</p><p>• Hypertension: Monitor women who develop hypertension during therapy; consider risk versus benefit of continuation. Use is contraindicated with uncontrolled hypertension.</p><p>• Jaundice: Monitor women who develop jaundice during therapy; consider risk versus benefit of continuation. Use is contraindicated in women with cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity ("gasping syndrome") in neonates; the "gasping syndrome" consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggest that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p>• Castor oil: Some formulations contain castor oil. Discontinue if allergic reactions (eg urticaria, pruritus, angioedema) occur.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Preterm birth: The effectiveness of hydroxyprogesterone is based on improvement in the proportion of women who delivered at less than 37 weeks of gestation. Clinical benefits related to improved neonatal mortality or morbidity following maternal use have not been demonstrated. Not intended to stop active preterm labor.</p><p>• Appropriate use: Uterine adenocarcinoma: While the intramuscular solution is approved for the treatment of stage III or IV adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus, chemotherapy may be preferable to progestin therapy in the management of advanced disease. Based on a systematic review, response to hormonal therapy is inversely proportional to tumor grade (Decruze 2007).</p><p>• Laboratory changes: Use may change the results of some laboratory tests (eg, coagulation factors, tests of hepatic or thyroid function).</p><p>• Product selection: Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is available in multiple dosage forms. The Makena brand and the generic product (generic for Delautin) have different indications (Makena pregnancy indications; the generic product has non-pregnancy indications); products are not interchangeable.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Glucose (in patients with prediabetes or diabetes); blood pressure; signs/symptoms of depression, fluid retention, jaundice, and/or thromboembolic disorders.</p><p>Non-pregnancy uses: Papanicolaou smear, pelvic organ and breast exam prior to therapy</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Adverse events were not observed in human studies following second or third trimester exposure; use not studied during first trimester.</p><p>Following use of Makena, maternal serum concentrations of hydroxyprogesterone caproate are widely variable and may be decreased in women with increased BMI. Hydroxyprogesterone is metabolized by the placenta and reaches the fetal circulation. In one study, the cord:maternal concentration ratio averaged 0.2. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate was detected in cord blood when delivery occurred ≥44 days after the last injection (Caritis 2012; Hemauer 2008).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It delays a baby's birth when it is too early.</p><p>• It is used to treat some uterine cancers.</p><p>• It is used to treat abnormal period (menstrual) cycles.</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
