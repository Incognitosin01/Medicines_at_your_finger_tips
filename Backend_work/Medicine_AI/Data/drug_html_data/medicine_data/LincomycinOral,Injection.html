Therefore, lincomycin therapy should be reserved for serious infections where less toxic antimicrobial agents are inappropriate. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate supportive therapy, such as fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>
