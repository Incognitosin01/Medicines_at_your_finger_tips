If coadministration cannot be avoided, selpercatinib should be administered 2 hours before or 2 hours after antacids.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Selumetinib: May enhance the antiplatelet effect of Agents with Antiplatelet Properties.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Serotonin/Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors: May enhance the antiplatelet effect of Aspirin.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Sincalide: Drugs that Affect Gallbladder Function may diminish the therapeutic effect of Sincalide.  Management: Consider discontinuing drugs that may affect gallbladder motility prior to the use of sincalide to stimulate gallbladder contraction.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Sotalol: Antacids may decrease the serum concentration of Sotalol.  Management: Avoid simultaneous administration of sotalol and antacids. Administer antacids 2 hours after sotalol.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Spironolactone: Aspirin may diminish the therapeutic effect of Spironolactone. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Sucroferric Oxyhydroxide: May decrease the serum concentration of Aspirin. Management: Administer aspirin at least 1 hour before administration of sucroferric oxyhydroxide.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Sulfinpyrazone: Salicylates may decrease the serum concentration of Sulfinpyrazone. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Sulpiride: Antacids may decrease the serum concentration of Sulpiride.  Management: Separate administration of antacids and sulpiride by at least 2 hours in order to minimize the impact of antacids on sulpiride absorption.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Talniflumate: Aspirin may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Talniflumate.  Management: When possible, consider alternatives to this combination.  Concurrent use is generally not recommended.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Tetracyclines: Antacids may decrease the absorption of Tetracyclines.  Management: Separate administration of antacids and oral tetracycline derivatives by several hours when possible to minimize the extent of this potential interaction. Monitor for decreased therapeuctic effects of tetracyclines.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Thiopental: Aspirin may decrease the protein binding of Thiopental. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Thrombolytic Agents: Agents with Antiplatelet Properties may enhance the anticoagulant effect of Thrombolytic Agents. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Thrombolytic Agents: Salicylates may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Thrombolytic Agents. An increased risk of bleeding may occur. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Ticagrelor: Aspirin may enhance the antiplatelet effect of Ticagrelor. Aspirin may diminish the therapeutic effect of Ticagrelor. More specifically, the benefits of ticagrelor relative to clopidogrel may be diminished in adult patients receiving daily aspirin doses greater than 100-150 mg daily.  Management: Avoid daily aspirin doses greater than 100 mg in adults receiving ticagrelor.  Canadian recommendations are to avoid adult daily aspirin doses greater than 150 mg.  Daily low-dose aspirin (U.S.: 75-100 mg; Canada: 75-150 mg) is recommended.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Tiludronate: Aspirin may decrease the serum concentration of Tiludronate. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Tipranavir: May enhance the antiplatelet effect of Agents with Antiplatelet Properties.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Tricyclic Antidepressants (Tertiary Amine): May enhance the antiplatelet effect of Aspirin.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Urokinase: Agents with Antiplatelet Properties may enhance the anticoagulant effect of Urokinase. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Valproate Products: Salicylates may increase the serum concentration of Valproate Products. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Varicella Virus-Containing Vaccines: Salicylates may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Varicella Virus-Containing Vaccines. Specifically, the risk for Reye's syndrome may increase. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Velpatasvir: Antacids may decrease the serum concentration of Velpatasvir.  Management: Separate administration of velpatasvir and antacids by at least 4 hours.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Vitamin E (Systemic): May enhance the antiplatelet effect of Agents with Antiplatelet Properties.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Vitamin K Antagonists (eg, warfarin): Salicylates may enhance the anticoagulant effect of Vitamin K Antagonists.  Management: Avoid as needed use of salicylates in patients taking vitamin K antagonists. Aspirin (80 to 325 mg/day) may be used with warfarin for prevention of cardiovascular events. If coadministering salicylates and vitamin K antagonists, monitor for bledding.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Zanubrutinib: May enhance the antiplatelet effect of Agents with Antiplatelet Properties.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>See aspirin and sodium bicarbonate monographs.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• GI bleeding: Aspirin may cause severe stomach bleeding; risk factors include patients ≥60 years; history of stomach ulcers or bleeding problems; coadministration with anticoagulants or steroids; coadministration with other NSAIDs; ≥3 alcoholic drinks every day during therapy; and prolonged use or administration of more than the recommended dose.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Aspirin may cause a severe allergic reaction, including hives, skin reddening, facial swelling, rash, asthma, blisters, and/or shock.
