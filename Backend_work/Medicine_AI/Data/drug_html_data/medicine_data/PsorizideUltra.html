These drug ingredients are listed in the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS).<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p>Inactive ingredients: Lactose and Magnesium Stearate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pharmacological class:</span> Homeopathic drug</p><p><span class="Bold">Dosage form:</span> Oral 300 mg scored tablet. May be swallowed whole, chewed or dissolved in the mouth and swallowed.</p><h2>Psorizide Ultra - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The active ingredients in PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> ULTRA are inorganic soluble mineral salts. The exact mechanism of action is unknown; however, it is believed PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> ULTRA addresses a primary genetic biochemical defect.</p><p><span class="Bold">POTASSIUM BROMIDE</span> dissolves and dissociates in the digestive tract into its ionic constituents. Each tablet contains approximately 15 mg bromide (calculated). Ionic bromide is rapidly and completely absorbed from the intestine and distributed almost exclusively in the extracellular fluids.<span class="Sup">7,8</span> Bromide is eliminated by the kidneys and the elimination half-life is 11-12 days. "Once a day" dosing will lead to a steady state concentration in about seven weeks.<span class="Sup">7</span></p><p><span class="Bold">NICKEL SULPHATE</span> dissolves and dissociates in the digestive tract into its ionic constituents. Each tablet contains approximately 1.5 mg of ionic nickel (calculated). According to studies, 15% to 50% of ionic nickel is absorbed on a fasted stomach.<span class="Sup">2</span> Food markedly decreases the rate and extent of nickel absorption. <span class="Sup">3,4</span> Clinical studies show that serum concentrations of nickel are variable among patients after administering the same dosage.<span class="Sup">5</span> Peak serum nickel concentration is reached about two hours after oral administration. "Once a day" dosing leads to steady state serum concentrations in approximately one week. Nickel is in its highly stable divalent cation state and is therefore not expected to be metabolized to any significant degree in the body. Absorbed nickel is primarily excreted in the urine and elimination half-life is about 21 hours.<span class="Sup">3,5</span> Renal clearance is rapid and efficient, and nickel does not accumulate in the body.<span class="Sup">6</span></p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">A variety of controlled clinical studies have been performed using various sources of both nickel and bromide in over 300 subjects. Clinical efficacy and safety have been documented in a significant number of subjects. Published and unpublished reports are available upon request.<span class="Sup">9,22,23</span></p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> ULTRA is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe eczema, atopic dermatitis, seborrhea and seborrheic dermatitis. It has been found to work well with variety of combination therapies. Psoriasis also responds, but generally has a more favorable response to PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte (NDC 61480-255-05.)</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Although there are no known contraindications, patients who are allergic to any PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> ULTRA ingredient should consult a physician prior to taking the medication. (Refer to Section on Hypersensitivity)</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First">Do not use if imprinted seal under bottle cap is missing or broken. Do not use if pregnant or nursing. If allergic to nickel or metal objects such as jewelry or if there is a history of blistering hand eczema, see PRECAUTIONS for hypersensitivity information. Lactose intolerant patients may have gastrointestinal difficulty. This has very rarely been reported at the doses used.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Carefully adjust dosage to weight when treating young children. Do not use in cases of kidney disease. If skin rash appears or if nervous symptoms persist, recur frequently, or are unusual, discontinue use.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Caution should be used when administering to patients with a history of contact sensitivity to nickel (common metal exposure) or if there is a history of vesicular hand eczema (dyshidrosis, pomphylox). Nickel allergy may be confirmed by a positive nickel patch test. Most patients with hand eczema, positive nickel allergy history, or a positive nickel patch test <span class="Bold">do not</span> have any untoward reaction to administration of PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> ULTRA. If there is a history of nickel sensitivity or dyshidrotic hand eczema, begin with a very low dose and slowly increase to a recommended starting dose over a period of 5 weeks as tolerated, thus allowing progressive GI absorption*.</p><p>If new pruritic rashes occur or persist, discontinue PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> ULTRA and treat appropriately. <span class="Bold">Do not use if there is a history of extra-cutaneous hypersensitivity to nickel or bromide.</span></p><h3>Information for patients</h3><p class="First">Patients using PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> ULTRA should receive the following information and instructions:</p><h3>Drug interactions</h3><p class="First">There are no known drug interactions.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility</h3><p class="First">No studies have been done on the carcinogenesis or mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility of PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> ULTRA. No carcinogenesis or mutagenesis has been reported in multiple animal studies for oral administration of soluble nickel and bromide salts (active ingredients) even at very high doses.<span class="Sup">10-16</span></p><p class="First">KBr is not listed as a carcinogen by the NTP, IARC, and OSHA.<span class="Sup">18</span></p><p class="First">Studies on experimental animals have never indicated that nickel, at any dose, is a carcinogen when introduced to the body orally. Furthermore, Nickel sulphate and other highly water soluble nickel salts, have never been known to induce carcinogenesis via any route of introduction including: oral, inhalation, cutaneous, IM, or IP.<span class="Sup">10-12,17</span> No adverse effects were noted on fertility or reproduction in a 3-generational study of albino Wistar rats fed up to 1000 ppm Ni per day, which is equivalent to 50 mg/kg body weight per day Ni.<span class="Sup">17</span></p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> ULTRA. PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> ULTRA should not be given to a pregnant woman.</p><h3>Nursing mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. However, since many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> ULTRA is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric use</h3><p class="First">Carefully adjust dosage to weight when treating young children.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> ULTRA contains low doses of active ingredients. Therefore there are minimal known side effects.<br/>
(see PRECAUTIONS for hypersensitivity information)</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Potassium bromide toxicity</h3><p class="First">Indications of toxicity due to oral overdosage of bromide may include nausea, vomiting, apathy, disturbed coordination, loss of memory, drowsiness, loss of emotional control, agitation, hallucination, tremors, depressed reflexes, stupor, and coma. Acute toxic reactions in humans have been reported at doses as low as 1000 mg.<span class="Sup">21</span> This level is 67 times the dose received in one tablet of PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> ULTRA.</p><h3>Nickel sulphate toxicity</h3><p class="First">The oral rat LD<span class="Sub">50</span> for nickel sulphate hexahydrate is 275 mg/kg.<span class="Sup">19</span> Symptoms of toxicity due to oral overdosage of nickel sulphate may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, giddiness, lassitude, headaches, cough, and shortness of breath.<span class="Sup">20</span> The lowest observed transitory toxic effects from human ingestion of soluble nickel salts is approximately 8 mg nickel/kg body weight.<span class="Sup">20</span> This is 80 times the maximum dose recommended for PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> ULTRA. (See below).</p><h2>Psorizide Ultra Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Absorption of nickel sulphate is variable among individuals. For maximum absorption, tablets should be taken orally at the beginning of the day (or any convenient time after having taken nothing but water for at least 7 hours). Take nothing but water for one hour after taking medication to aid absorption.</p><p><span class="Bold">In the setting of renal impairment, dosage should be adjusted and serum nickel and bromide levels should be followed.</span> Steady state trough level should be drawn <span class="Bold">prior</span> to ingesting the day's dose after one week of dosing or at appropriate intervals. Target trough serum nickel level is 20-40 mcg/L. (Warning: post dose peak levels are unreliable.) Treatment duration depends on the individual. Increase dose as needed on a monthly basis.</p><h3>Maintenance phase</h3><p class="First">In order to maintain symptomatic relief, medication may be continued at the same or reduced initial phase dose level.</p><h2>INACTIVE INGREDIENTS</h2><p class="First">Lactose and magnesium stearate.</p><h2>How is Psorizide Ultra Supplied</h2><p class="First">Scored tablets, off white in color with green speckles, with <span class="Bold">LL and score</span> imprinted on same side, in child-resistant and tamper-resistant bottles of 100. <span class="Bold">NDC 61480-124-05.</span></p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Plymouth Pharmaceuticals Inc. dba LOMA LUX Laboratories; P.O.
