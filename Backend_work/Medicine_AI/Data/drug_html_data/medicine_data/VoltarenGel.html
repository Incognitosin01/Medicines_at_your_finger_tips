Diclofenac works by reducing substances in the body that cause pain and inflammation.</p><p>Voltaren Gel is used to treat joint pain caused by osteoarthritis in the hands, wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, or feet.</p><p>Voltaren Gel may not be effective in treating arthritis pain elsewhere in the body.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Voltaren Gel if you have ever had asthma or a severe allergic reaction caused by aspirin, diclofenac (Cataflam, Voltaren), or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).</p><p>Diclofenac can increase your risk of fatal heart attack or stroke, especially if you use it long term or take high doses, or if you have heart disease. Do not use this medicine just before or after heart bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG).</p><p>Diclofenac may also cause stomach or intestinal bleeding, which can be fatal. These conditions can occur without warning while you are using Voltaren Gel, especially in older adults.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Voltaren Gel can increase your risk of fatal heart attack or stroke, especially if you use it long term or take high doses, or if you have heart disease. Even people without heart disease or risk factors could have a stroke or heart attack while using Voltaren Gel. Do not use this medicine just before or after heart bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG).</p><p>You should not use Voltaren Gel if you are allergic to diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam, Flector, and others), or if you have ever had an asthma attack or severe allergic reaction after taking aspirin or an NSAID.</p><p>To make sure Voltaren Gel is safe for you, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have:</p><ul>

Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2>How should I use Voltaren Gel?</h2><p>Use Voltaren Gel exactly as prescribed by your doctor or as instructed on the packaging. Do not use this medicine in larger amounts or for longer than recommended. Use the lowest dose that is effective in treating your condition.</p><p>Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>Wash your hands after applying Voltaren Gel, unless you are treating the skin on your hands. Wait at least 10 minutes before dressing or wearing gloves. Wait at least 1 hour before you bathe or shower.</p><p>Do not apply to an open skin wound, or on areas of infection, rash, burn, or peeling skin. Do not cover treated skin with a bandage or expose it to heat from a hot tub, heating pad, or sauna. Heat or bandaging can increase the amount of diclofenac you absorb through your skin.</p><p>To treat osteoarthritis pain with Voltaren Gel: This medicine is supplied with dosing cards that show you how much gel to use for a 2-gram dose or a 4-gram dose. Squeeze the gel onto this card along the line for your dose. Use no more gel than will fit on the length of your dosing line. Wipe the card directly onto the treatment area and rub gently into the skin.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.
