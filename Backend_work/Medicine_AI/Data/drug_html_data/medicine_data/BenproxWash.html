The exact mechanism of action of benzoyl peroxide in acne vulgaris is not known. Benzoyl Peroxide is an antibacterial agent with demonstrated activity against Propionibacterium acnes. This action combined with the mild keralytic effect of Benzoyl Peroxide is believed to be responsible for its usefulness in acne. Benzoyl Peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is metabolized to benzoic acid and excreted as benzoate in the urine.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Benprox Wash</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Benprox Wash 5.25%</span> is indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Benprox Wash 5.25%</span> is contraindicated in patients with a history of hyper-sensitivity to any of the ingredients in each product.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> For external use only. If severe irritation develops, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. After reaction clears, treatment may often be resumed with less frequent application. These preparations should not be used in or near the eyes or on mucous membranes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Patient Information and Cautions:</span><br/>
Avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, lips, and mucous membranes. If accidental contact occurs, rinse with water. Contact with any colored material (including hair and fabric) will result in bleaching or discoloration. If excessive irritation develops, discontinue use and consult your physician. When using this product, avoid unnecessary exposure to the sun and use a sunscreen.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span><br/>
Data from several studies employing a strain of mice that is highly susceptible to developing cancer suggest that benzoyl peroxide acts as a tumor promoter. The clinical significance of these findings to humans is unknown. Benzoyl Peroxide has been found to be mutagenic (Ames Test) and there are no published data indicating it impairs fertility.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Pregnancy:</span><br/>
Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Benzoyl Peroxide. It is not known whether Benzoyl Peroxide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Benzoyl Peroxide should be used by a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. There are no available data on the effect of Benzoyl Peroxide on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the unborn child.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Nursing Mothers:</span> It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Benzoyl Peroxide is administered to a nursing woman.<br/>
