Fresh rose hips contain large amounts of vitamin C, but dried rose hips and rose seeds do not contain as much vitamin C. Suplemental vitamin C is therefore often added to rose hip herbal products.</p><p>Rose hips have been used in alternative medicine to treat rheumatoid arthritis, fever, diarrhea, upset stomach, infections, the common cold, and other conditions. However, rose hips have not been proven with research to be effective in treating these conditions.</p><p>It is not certain whether rose hips are effective in treating any medical condition. Medicinal use of this product has not been approved by the FDA. Rose hips should not be used in place of medication prescribed for you by your doctor.</p><p>Rose hips are often sold as an herbal supplement. There are no regulated manufacturing standards in place for many herbal compounds and some marketed supplements have been found to be contaminated with toxic metals or other drugs.
