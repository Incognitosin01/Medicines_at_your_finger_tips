For tigecycline, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to tigecycline or any other medicines.

This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects. If your symptoms do not improve or if they become worse, call your doctor right away.</p><p>Using tigecycline while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Birth control pills may not work while you are using tigecycline. To keep from getting pregnant, use another form of birth control along with your birth control pills.

It may occur 2 months or more after you stop taking tigecycline. Do not take any medicine to treat diarrhea without first checking with your doctor. Diarrhea medicines may make the diarrhea worse or make it last longer. If you have any questions about this or if mild diarrhea continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.</p><p>Tigecycline may cause your skin to be more sensitive to sunlight than it is normally. Exposure to sunlight, even for brief periods of time, may cause a skin rash, itching, redness or other discoloration of the skin, or a severe sunburn. Use a sunscreen when you are outdoors.
