Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Adverse Reactions (6)].</span></p><h3>Enterocolitis and Neutropenic Colitis</h3><p class="First">Enterocolitis and neutropenic colitis (typhlitis) have occurred in patients treated with docetaxel alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, despite the coadministration of G-CSF. Caution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications. Enterocolitis and neutropenic enterocolitis may develop at any time, and could lead to death as early as the first day of symptom onset. Monitor patients closely from onset of any symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity. Inform patients to contact their healthcare provider with new, or worsening symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Monitor patients closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the docetaxel infusion and aggressive therapy. Do not rechallenge patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions with docetaxel <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p>Patients who have previously experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may develop a hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel that may include severe or fatal reactions such as anaphylaxis. Monitor patients with a previous history of hypersensitivity to paclitaxel closely during initiation of docetaxel therapy. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a docetaxel infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of docetaxel <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Fluid Retention</h3><p class="First">Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each docetaxel administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions.</p><p>When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg.</p><p>Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, <span class="Italics">e.g</span>., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s).</p><h3>Second Primary Malignancies</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Second primary malignancies, notably acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), and renal cancer, have been reported in patients treated with docetaxel-containing regimens. These adverse reactions may occur several months or years after docetaxel-containing therapy.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Treatment-related AML or MDS has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. Monitor patients for second primary malignancies <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</span></p><h3>Cutaneous Reactions</h3><p class="First">Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]</span>. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel due to skin toxicity.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with docetaxel treatment. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and monitored closely. Permanent treatment discontinuation should be considered in patients who experience SCARs.</span></p><h3>Neurologic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g. paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]</span>. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965).</p><h3>Eye Disorders</h3><p class="First">Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered.</p><h3>Asthenia</h3><p class="First">Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action, docetaxel can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]</span>. Available data from case reports in the literature and pharmacovigilance with docetaxel use in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform the drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, administration of docetaxel to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicities, including intrauterine mortality, at doses as low as 0.02 and 0.003 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating docetaxel. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of docetaxel. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of docetaxel <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]</span>.</span></p><h3>Alcohol Content</h3><p class="First">Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of docetaxel injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in docetaxel injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. Each administration of docetaxel injection at 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> delivers 2.0 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span> of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m<span class="Sup">2</span>, this would deliver 4.0 grams of ethanol <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)]</span>. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol.</p><h3>Tumor Lysis Syndrome</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported with docetaxel <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. Patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome (e.g., with renal impairment, hyperuricemia, bulky tumor) should be closely monitored prior to initiating docetaxel and periodically during treatment. Correction of dehydration and treatment of high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of treatment.</span><br/></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel are:</p><ul class="Disk">

Docetaxel has the following structural formula:</p><p>Docetaxel is a white to almost-white powder with an empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">43</span>H<span class="Sub">53</span>NO<span class="Sub">14</span>, and a molecular weight of 807.9.

Docetaxel binds to free tubulin and promotes the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules while simultaneously inhibiting their disassembly. This leads to the production of microtubule bundles without normal function and to the stabilization of microtubules, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells. Docetaxel's binding to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments in the bound microtubules, a feature which differs from most spindle poisons currently in clinical use.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel has been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of 20 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> to 115 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> in phase 1 studies. The area under the curve (AUC) was dose proportional following doses of 70 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> to 115 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> with infusion times of 1 to 2 hours. Docetaxel's pharmacokinetic profile is consistent with a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model, with half-lives for the α, β, and γ phases of 4 min, 36 min, and 11.1 hr, respectively. Mean total body clearance was 21 L/h/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The initial rapid decline represents distribution to the peripheral compartments and the late (terminal) phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel from the peripheral compartment. Mean steady state volume of distribution was 113 L. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies showed that docetaxel is about 94% protein bound, mainly to α<span class="Sub">1</span>-acid glycoprotein, albumin, and lipoproteins. In three cancer patients, the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> binding to plasma proteins was found to be approximately 97%. Dexamethasone does not affect the protein binding of docetaxel.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> drug interaction studies revealed that docetaxel is metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme, and its metabolism may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>A study of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-docetaxel was conducted in three cancer patients. Docetaxel was eliminated in both the urine and feces following oxidative metabolism of the <span class="Italics">tert</span>-butyl ester group, but fecal excretion was the main elimination route. Within 7 days, urinary and fecal excretion accounted for approximately 6% and 75% of the administered radioactivity, respectively.

Response rates increased with docetaxel dose: 19.9% for the 60 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> group compared to 22.3% for the 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> and 29.8% for the 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> group; pair-wise comparison between the 60 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> and 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> groups was statistically significant (p=0.037).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Single Arm Studies</span></p><p>Docetaxel at a dose of 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> was studied in six single arm studies involving a total of 309 patients with metastatic breast cancer in whom previous chemotherapy had failed. Among these, 190 patients had anthracycline-resistant breast cancer, defined as progression during an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease, or relapse during an anthracycline-containing adjuvant regimen. In anthracycline-resistant patients, the overall response rate was 37.9% (72/190; 95% CI: 31.0–44.8) and the complete response rate was 2.1%.</p><p>Docetaxel was also studied in three single arm Japanese studies at a dose of 60 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, in 174 patients who had received prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Among 26 patients whose best response to an anthracycline had been progression, the response rate was 34.6% (95% CI: 17.2–55.7), similar to the response rate in single arm studies of 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.</p><h3>Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer</h3><p class="First">A multicenter, open-label, randomized trial (TAX316) evaluated the efficacy and safety of docetaxel for the adjuvant treatment of patients with axillary-node-positive breast cancer and no evidence of distant metastatic disease. After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1–3, 4+), 1491 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (FAC arm). Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour infusion; all other drugs were given as intravenous bolus on day 1. In both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years. Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who received TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC.</p><p>Results from a second interim analysis (median follow-up 55 months) are as follows: In study TAX316, the docetaxel-containing combination regimen TAC showed significantly longer disease-free survival (DFS) than FAC (hazard ratio=0.74; 2-sided 95% CI=0.60, 0.92, stratified log rank p=0.0047). The primary endpoint, disease-free survival, included local and distant recurrences, contralateral breast cancer and deaths from any cause. The overall reduction in risk of relapse was 25.7% for TAC-treated patients. (See Figure 1.)</p><p>At the time of this interim analysis, based on 219 deaths, overall survival was longer for TAC than FAC (hazard ratio=0.69, 2-sided 95% CI=0.53, 0.90). (See Figure 2.)

The primary endpoint of the study was survival. Patients were initially randomized to docetaxel 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or best supportive care, but early toxic deaths at this dose led to a dose reduction to docetaxel 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. A total of 104 patients were randomized in this amended study to either docetaxel 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or best supportive care.</p><p>In a second randomized trial (TAX320), 373 patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, and an ECOG performance status ≤2 were randomized to docetaxel 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, docetaxel 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> and a treatment in which the investigator chose either vinorelbine 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> days 1, 8, and 15 repeated every 3 weeks or ifosfamide 2 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span> days 1–3 repeated every 3 weeks.

Treatment with docetaxel+cisplatin did not result in a statistically significantly superior survival compared to vinorelbine+cisplatin (see table below). The 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio (adjusted for interim analysis and multiple comparisons) shows that the addition of docetaxel to cisplatin results in an outcome ranging from a 6% inferior to a 26% superior survival compared to the addition of vinorelbine to cisplatin. The results of a further statistical analysis showed that at least (the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval) 62% of the known survival effect of vinorelbine when added to cisplatin (about a 2-month increase in median survival; Wozniak et al. JCO, 1998) was maintained. The efficacy data for the docetaxel+cisplatin arm and the comparator arm are summarized in Table 16.</p><p>The second comparison in the same three-arm study, vinorelbine+cisplatin versus docetaxel+carboplatin, did not demonstrate superior survival associated with the docetaxel arm (Kaplan-Meier estimate of median survival was 9.1 months for docetaxel+carboplatin compared to 10.0 months on the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm) and the docetaxel+carboplatin arm did not demonstrate preservation of at least 50% of the survival effect of vinorelbine added to cisplatin. Secondary endpoints evaluated in the trial included objective response and time to progression. There was no statistically significant difference between docetaxel+cisplatin and vinorelbine+cisplatin with respect to objective response and time to progression (see Table 17).</p><h3>Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in combination with prednisone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomized multicenter active control trial.

A total of 445 patients with KPS &gt;70 were treated with either docetaxel (T) (75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> on day 1) in combination with cisplatin (C) (75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> on day 1) and fluorouracil (F) (750 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per day for 5 days) or cisplatin (100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> on day 1) and fluorouracil (1000 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per day for 5 days). The length of a treatment cycle was 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF arm. The demographic characteristics were balanced between the two treatment arms. The median age was 55 years, 71% were male, 71% were Caucasian, 24% were 65 years of age or older, 19% had a prior curative surgery and 12% had palliative surgery. The median number of cycles administered per patient was 6 (with a range of 1–16) for the TCF arm compared to 4 (with a range of 1–12) for the CF arm. Time to progression (TTP) was the primary endpoint and was defined as time from randomization to disease progression or death from any cause within 12 weeks of the last evaluable tumor assessment or within 12 weeks of the first infusion of study drugs for patients with no evaluable tumor assessment after randomization. The hazard ratio (HR) for TTP was 1.47 (CF/TCF, 95% CI: 1.19–1.83) with a significantly longer TTP (p=0.0004) in the TCF arm. Approximately 75% of patients had died at the time of this analysis. Overall survival was significantly longer (p=0.0201) in the TCF arm with a HR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.04–1.61).

At the end of chemotherapy, with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks, patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy (RT) according to institutional guidelines. Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either with a conventional fraction regimen (1.8 Gy–2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to 70 Gy) or with an accelerated/hyperfractionated regimen (twice a day, with a minimum interfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week, for a total dose of 70 to 74 Gy, respectively).

<li><span class="Bold">The chance of death in people who receive docetaxel is higher if you:</span>
<ul class="Circle">
<li>have liver problems</li>
<li>receive high doses of docetaxel</li>
<li>have non-small cell lung cancer and have been treated with chemotherapy medicines that contain platinum</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Docetaxel can affect your blood cells.</span> Your healthcare provider should do routine blood tests during treatment with docetaxel. This will include regular checks of your white blood cell counts. If your white blood cells are too low, your healthcare provider may not treat you with docetaxel until you have enough white blood cells. People with low white blood cell counts can develop life-threatening infections. The earliest sign of infection may be fever. Follow your healthcare provider's instructions for how often to take your temperature during treatment with docetaxel. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have a fever.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Swelling (inflammation) of the small intestine and colon.</span> This can happen at any time during treatment and could lead to death as early as the first day you get symptoms. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop new or worse symptoms of intestinal problems, including stomach (abdominal) pain or tenderness or diarrhea, with or without fever.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Severe allergic reactions</span> are medical emergencies that can happen in people who receive docetaxel and can lead to death. You may be at higher risk of developing a severe allergic reaction to docetaxel if you are allergic to paclitaxel. Your healthcare provider will monitor you closely for allergic reactions during your docetaxel infusion.<br/>
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these signs of a severe allergic reaction:
<ul class="Circle">
<li>trouble breathing</li>
<li>sudden swelling of your face, lips, tongue, throat, or trouble swallowing</li>
<li>hives (raised bumps), rash, or redness all over your body</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Your body may hold too much fluid (severe fluid retention)</span> during treatment with docetaxel. This can be life threatening. To decrease the chance of this happening, you must take another medicine, a corticosteroid, before each docetaxel treatment. You must take the corticosteroid exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. Tell your healthcare provider or nurse before your docetaxel treatment if you forgot to take your corticosteroid dose or do not take it as your healthcare provider tells you. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have swelling in your legs or feet, weight gain or shortness of breath.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Risk of new cancers.</span> An increase in new (second) cancers has happened in people treated with docetaxel together with certain other anticancer treatments. This includes certain blood cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), and kidney cancer.
<ul class="Circle">
<li>Changes in blood counts due to leukemia and other blood disorders may occur years after treatment with docetaxel.</li>
