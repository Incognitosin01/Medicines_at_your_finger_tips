Do not administer intradermally, IV, or SubQ. Shake well prior to use; do not use unless a homogeneous, turbid, white suspension forms. Discard if the suspension is discolored or if there are cracks in the vial or syringe. Do not mix with other vaccines or injections; separate needles and syringes should be used for each injection (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). US law requires that the date of administration, the vaccine manufacturer, lot number of vaccine, Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) edition date and date it was provided, and the administering person's name, title, and address be recorded.</p><p>For patients at risk of hemorrhage following intramuscular injection, the vaccine should be administered intramuscularly if, in the opinion of the physician familiar with the patient's bleeding risk, the vaccine can be administered by this route with reasonable safety. If the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, intramuscular vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered. A fine needle (23 gauge or smaller) can be used for the vaccination and firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. The patient should be instructed concerning the risk of hematoma from the injection. Patients on anticoagulant therapy should be considered to have the same bleeding risks and treated as those with clotting factor disorders (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Kinrix, Quadracel: Store under refrigeration of 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F); do not freeze.

Management: Avoid administration of vaccines (inactivated) during treatment with siponimod and for 1 month after discontinuation due to potential decreased vaccine efficacy.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Venetoclax: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p><b>All serious adverse reactions must be reported to the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) 1-800-822-7967 or online at https://vaers.hhs.gov/esub/index.</b> In Canada, adverse reactions may be reported to local provincial/territorial health agencies or to the Vaccine Safety Section at Public Health Agency of Canada (1-866-844-0018).</p><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified. Adverse events reported within 4 to 7 days of vaccination:</p><p>&gt;10%:</p><p>Cardiovascular: Swelling of injected limb (arm circumference increase: 36% to 68%), swelling of injected limb (extensive, 2%)</p><p>Central nervous system: Malaise (35%), drowsiness (19%), headache (16%)</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Decreased appetite (16%)</p><p>Local: Injection site: Pain at injection site (57% to 77%), erythema at injection site (37% to 59%), swelling (26% to 40%)</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Myalgia (54%)</p><p>Miscellaneous: Fever (6% to 16%)</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Abscess at injection site, anaphylaxis, cerebrovascular accident, convulsions, cyanosis, dehydration, febrile seizures, gastroenteritis, hypernatremia, hypersensitivity reaction, hypotonia, hypotonic/hyporesponsive episode, inflammation at injection site, injection site cellulitis, lethargy, pallor, pruritus, residual mass at injection site, screaming, skin vesicle (injection site), sterile abscess at injection site, syncope</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions: Immediate treatment (including epinephrine 1 mg/mL) for anaphylactoid and/or hypersensitivity reactions should be available during vaccine use (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). Boostrix-Polio and Infanrix-IPV [Canadian products] labeling recommend monitoring for hypersensitivity reactions for 30 minutes after administration.</p><p>• Arthus-type hypersensitivity: Patients with a history of severe local reaction (Arthus-type) following a previous diphtheria toxoid or tetanus toxoid containing vaccine dose should not be given further routine or emergency doses of Td unless ≥10 years since most recent dose, even if using for wound management with wounds that are not clean or minor; these patients generally have high serum antitoxin levels (CDC/ACIP [Liang 2018]).</p><p>• Reactions from previous pertussis vaccination: Carefully consider use in patients with history of any of the following effects from previous administration of a pertussis-containing vaccine: Fever ≥40.5°C (105°F) within 48 hours of unknown cause; seizures with or without fever occurring within 3 days; persistent, inconsolable crying episodes lasting ≥3 hours and occurring within 48 hours; collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) occurring within 48 hours (CDC/ACIP [Liang 2018]). Use is contraindicated in patients who have had encephalopathy within 7 days of a previous pertussis-containing vaccine.</p><p>• Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration: Vaccine administration that is too high on the upper arm may cause shoulder injury (eg, shoulder bursitis or tendinopathy) resulting in shoulder pain and reduced range of motion following injection. Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns: </i></b></p><p>• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever); vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with a history of bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia); bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; if the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM injection can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Guillain-Barré syndrome: Use with caution if Guillain-Barré syndrome occurred within 6 weeks of prior tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine (CDC/ACIP [Liang 2018]).</p><p>• Neurologic disorders: Use with caution in patients with progressive neurologic disease including infantile spasms, uncontrolled seizure, or a progressive encephalopathy, or conditions predisposing to seizures. ACIP guidelines recommend deferring immunization until health status can be assessed and condition stabilized (CDC/ACIP [Liang 2018]).</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Anticoagulant therapy: Use with caution in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy; bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP and the NACI recommend simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist. The use of combination vaccines is generally preferred over separate injections, taking into consideration provider assessment, patient preference, and adverse events. When using combination vaccines, the minimum age for administration is the oldest minimum age for any individual component; the minimum interval between dosing is the greatest minimum interval between any individual components. The ACIP prefers each dose of a specific vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer when possible; however, vaccination should not be deferred because a specific brand name is unavailable (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Special populations: </i></b></p><p>• Adults: Safety and efficacy of Kinrix, Quadracel, and Infanrix IPV [Canadian product] have not been established for use in adults.</p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Consider deferring immunization during periods of severe immunosuppression (eg, patients receiving chemo/radiation therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy [including high-dose corticosteroids]); may have a reduced response to vaccination. In general, household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive all age appropriate vaccines. Inactivated vaccines should be administered ≥2 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression when feasible; inactivated vaccines administered during chemotherapy should be readministered after immune competence is regained (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; IDSA [Rubin 2014].</p><p>• Pediatric: If Kinrix is inadvertently administered to children for an earlier dose in the series, it may be counted as a valid dose, provided the minimum interval requirements were met (CDC 57[39] 2008).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Aluminum: Product may contain aluminum.</p><p>• Latex: Packaging may contain natural latex rubber.</p><p>• Neomycin: Product may contain neomycin.</p><p>• Polymyxin B: Product may contain polymyxin B.</p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Antipyretics: According to the manufacturer, antipyretics may be considered at the time of and for 24 hours following vaccination to patients at high risk for seizures to reduce the possibility of postvaccination fever. However, antipyretics have not been shown to prevent febrile seizures; antipyretics may be used to treat fever or discomfort following vaccination (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). One study reported that routine prophylactic administration of acetaminophen to prevent fever prior to vaccination decreased the immune response of some vaccines; the clinical significance of this reduction in immune response has not been established (Prymula 2009).</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor for syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion. Boostrix-Polio and Infanrix-IPV [Canadian products] labeling recommend monitoring for hypersensitivity reactions for 30 minutes after administration.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Kinrix and Quadracel are not approved for use in patients &gt;7 years of age.</p><p>Adacel-Polio [Canadian product] is approved for use during pregnancy to provide passive immunization against pertussis in infants. Based on available data, adverse maternal or fetal outcomes have not been observed following maternal vaccination (most exposures occurred during the third trimester). Vaccination should be done during third trimester or as recommended by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization guidelines.</p><h2>More about diphtheria toxoid / pertussis, acellular / poliovirus vaccine, inactivated / tetanus toxoid</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
