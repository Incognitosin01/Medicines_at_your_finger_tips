Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><i><b>Concerns related to adverse effects:</b></i></p><p>• CNS effects: CNS symptoms (eg, insomnia, abnormal dreams, hallucinations) have been reported with efavirenz; symptoms usually start during first 1 to 2 days of treatment and generally resolve after 2 to 4 weeks; administration at bedtime may improve tolerability of CNS symptoms. May also cause CNS depression (eg, impaired concentration, dizziness or drowsiness); avoid potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving or operating machinery. Late-onset neurotoxicity, including ataxia and encephalopathy, may occur months to years after initiation of efavirenz therapy. Some of these events have been reported in patients with CYP2B6 genetic polymorphisms (associated with increased efavirenz levels at standard doses). Promptly assess patients with signs and symptoms of serious neurologic adverse effects and consider discontinuation of therapy.</p><p>• Decreased bone mineral density: In clinical trials, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has been associated with decreases in bone mineral density in HIV-1 infected adults and increases in bone metabolism markers. Serum parathyroid hormone and 1,25 vitamin D levels were also higher. Effects on long-term bone health and future fracture risk in adult and pediatric patients, including long-term effects on skeletal growth in pediatric patients and effects of extended duration in younger children, are unknown. Consider monitoring of bone density in adult and pediatric patients with a history of pathologic fractures or with other risk factors for bone loss or osteoporosis. Consider calcium and vitamin D supplementation for all patients; effect of supplementation has not been studied but may be beneficial. Long-term bone health and fracture risk unknown. If abnormalities are suspected, expert assessment is recommended.</p><p>• Fat redistribution: May cause redistribution/accumulation of body fat (eg, central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement [buffalo hump], peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, cushingoid appearance).</p><p>• Hepatotoxicity: Hepatitis, including fulminant hepatitis sometimes fatal or progressing to liver failure requiring transplantation, has been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. Reports have included patients with underlying hepatic disease (including hepatitis B or C), but have also included patients without hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors. Monitor liver function tests at baseline and during treatment in all patients. Discontinue treatment if elevation of serum transaminases is accompanied by signs or symptoms of hepatitis or hepatic decompensation; consider discontinuing treatment in patients with persistent elevations of serum transaminases &gt;5 times ULN.</p><p>• Hypercholesterolemia: Increases in total cholesterol and triglycerides have been reported with efavirenz; screening should be done prior to therapy and periodically throughout treatment.</p><p>• Immune reconstitution syndrome: Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome resulting in the occurrence of an inflammatory response to an indolent or residual opportunistic infection during initial HIV treatment or activation of autoimmune disorders (eg, Graves disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis) later in therapy; further evaluation and treatment may be required.</p><p>• Lactic acidosis/hepatomegaly: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported with use of nucleoside analogs and other antiretrovirals. Female gender and obesity may increase the risk for development. Suspend treatment in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (marked transaminase elevation may/may not accompany hepatomegaly and steatosis).</p><p>• Osteomalacia and renal dysfunction: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may cause osteomalacia with proximal renal tubulopathy. Bone pain, extremity pain, fractures, arthralgias, weakness, and muscle pain have been reported. In patients at risk for renal dysfunction, persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms should be evaluated for hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia.</p><p>• Pancreatitis: Has been reported with lamivudine, particularly in HIV-infected pediatric patients with a history of antiretroviral nucleoside use, history of pancreatitis, or significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment if signs of symptoms of pancreatitis occur.</p><p>• Psychiatric effects: Serious psychiatric symptoms have been associated with efavirenz, including severe depression, suicide attempts and ideation, paranoia, aggression, and mania. Use with caution in patients with a history of mental illness/drug abuse.</p><p>• QT prolongation: QT prolongation has been reported with efavirenz; consider alternative therapy in patients at risk of torsades de pointes or when coadministered with medications with known risk of torsades de pointes.</p><p>• Rash: Rash, ranging from mild to moderate maculopapular skin eruptions to life-threatening cutaneous reactions (eg, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome), may occur with efavirenz. Mild to moderate rashes occur within 2 weeks (median onset: 11 days) and resolve within 1 month in most patients continuing treatment. Treatment may be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy for mild to moderate rashes; discontinue use and consider alternative therapy if severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement, or fever develops. Pediatric patients are more susceptible to development of rash (median time to onset: 28 days); prophylactic antihistamines should be considered.</p><p>• Renal toxicity: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may cause renal toxicity (including acute renal failure and/or Fanconi syndrome); avoid use with concurrent or recent nephrotoxic therapy (including high-dose or multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] use). Acute renal failure has occurred in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal impairment who were on a stable tenofovir disoproxil fumarate regimen to which a high dose or multiple NSAID therapy was added. Consider alternatives to NSAIDs in patients taking tenofovir and at risk for renal impairment. Assess estimated CrCl, serum creatinine, serum phosphorus, urine glucose, and urine protein prior to initiation of therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy. Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend discontinuing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (and substituting with alternative antiretroviral therapy) in HIV-infected patients who develop a decline in GFR (a &gt;25% decrease in GFR from baseline and to a level of &lt;60 mL/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) during use, particularly in presence of proximal tubular dysfunction (eg, euglycemic glycosuria, increased urinary phosphorus excretion and hypophosphatemia, proteinuria [new onset or worsening]) (IDSA [Lucas 2014]).</p><p><i><b>Disease-related concerns:</b></i></p><p>• Chronic hepatitis B: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported following discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV).
