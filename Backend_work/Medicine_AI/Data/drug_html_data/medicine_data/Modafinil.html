Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p><b>Modafinil can make certain birth control less effective.</b> Hormonal contraception (birth control pills, injections, implants, skin patches, and vaginal rings) may not be effective enough to prevent pregnancy during your treatment. Talk with your doctor about the best methods of birth control to use while taking modafinil.</p><p>It is not known whether modafinil passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><p>Modafinil is not approved for use by anyone younger than 17 years old.</p><h2>How should I take modafinil?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not take  modafinil in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Modafinil may be habit-forming. <b>Never share modafinil with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away modafinil is against the law.</p><p>Modafinil is usually taken each morning to prevent daytime sleepiness, or 1 hour before the start of a work shift to treat work-time sleep disorders.</p><p>Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>You may take modafinil with or without food.</p><p>Modafinil is usually given for 12 weeks or less.</p><p>If you are taking modafinil to treat sleepiness caused by obstructive sleep apnea, you may also be treated with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. This machine is an air pump connected to a mask that gently blows pressurized air into your nose while you sleep. The pump does not breathe for you, but the gentle force of air helps keep your airway open to prevent obstruction.</p><p>Do not stop using your CPAP machine during sleep unless your doctor tells you to. The combination of treatment with CPAP and modafinil may be necessary to best treat your condition.</p><p>Modafinil will not cure obstructive sleep apnea or treat its underlying causes. Follow your doctor's instructions about all your other treatments for this disorder.</p><p>Call your doctor if you continue to have excessive sleepiness even while taking modafinil.</p><p>Taking modafinil does not take the place of getting enough sleep.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>Keep track of the amount of medicine used from each new bottle.
