This medication also causes changes in your cervical mucus and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus.</p><p>Loestrin 24 Fe is used as contraception to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>Loestrin 24 Fe may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Do not use Loestrin 24 Fe if you are pregnant or if you have recently had a baby.
