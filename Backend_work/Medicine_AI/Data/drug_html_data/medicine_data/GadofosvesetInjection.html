Avoid use of GBCAs unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced MRI. Screen all patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (eg, age greater than 60 years, hypertension, or diabetes), perform lab testing to estimate the GFR. For patients with the highest NSF risk, do not exceed recommended dose and allow a sufficient time period for elimination prior to readministration .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for gadofosveset</h2><p>Gadofosveset is a contrast agent. It is used in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to help create a clear picture of the blood vessels (arteries). The MRA scan is a special kind of diagnostic procedure. It uses magnets and computers to create images or “pictures” of the blood vessels in certain areas of the body. Gadofosveset is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA).</p><p>Gadofosveset is given by injection before MRA to help diagnose problems in the blood vessels (e.g., blockage of the arteries).</p><p>Gadofosveset is to be used only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using gadofosveset</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For gadofosveset, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to gadofosveset or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of gadofosveset in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of gadofosveset in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving gadofosveset.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of gadofosveset. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Asthma or allergies, history of or</li>
<li>Heart disease, history of or</li>
<li>Heart rhythm problems (e.g., QT prolongation) or</li>
<li>Kidney problems, severe (recent or long-term)—Use with caution. May cause side effects to become worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Diabetes or</li>
<li>Hypertension (high blood pressure)—Use with caution. May increase risk for kidney problems.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of gadofosveset</h2><p>A doctor or other trained health professional will give you gadofosveset. Gadofosveset is given through a needle placed in one of your veins just before you have an MRA scan.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using gadofosveset</h2><p><i>Check with your doctor right away if you have burning or itching of the skin; red or dark patches on the skin; skin swelling, hardening, or tightening; joint stiffness; limited range of motion in the arms and legs; pain that is deep in the hip bone or ribs; or muscle weakness</i>. These may be symptoms of a very serious disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).</p><p>Gadofosveset may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you have cold, clammy skin; confusion; dizziness; lightheadedness; a skin rash; itching; sweating; swelling of the face, tongue, and throat; trouble with breathing; or chest pain after you receive the medicine.</p><p>Gadofosveset can cause changes in the heart rhythm, such as a condition called QT prolongation.
