</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Fluticasone and Salmeterol Diskus</h2><h3>Treatment of Asthma</h3><p class="First">Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS is indicated for the twice-daily treatment of asthma in patients aged 4 years and older. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS should be used for patients not adequately controlled on a long-term asthma control medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or whose disease warrants initiation of treatment with both an ICS and long-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic agonist (LABA).</p><p><span class="Bold">Important Limitation of Use</span></p><p>Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.</p><h3>Maintenance Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</h3><p class="First">Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS inhalation powder 250/50 mcg is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS inhalation powder 250/50 mcg is also indicated to reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS inhalation powder 250/50 mcg twice daily is the only approved dosage for the treatment of COPD because an efficacy advantage of the higher strength Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS inhalation powder 500/50 mcg over Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS inhalation powder 250/50 mcg has not been demonstrated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Important Limitation of Use</span></p><p>Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.</p><h2>Fluticasone and Salmeterol Diskus Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS should be administered as 1 inhalation twice daily by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, the patient should rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.</p><p>More frequent administration or a greater number of inhalations (more than 1 inhalation twice daily) of the prescribed strength of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS is not recommended as some patients are more likely to experience adverse effects with higher doses of salmeterol. Patients using Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS should not use additional LABA for any reason. <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.12).]</span></p><h3>Asthma</h3><p class="First">If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist should be taken for immediate relief.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adult and Adolescent Patients Aged 12 Years and Older</span></p><p>For patients aged 12 years and older, the dosage is 1 inhalation twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart.</p><p>When choosing the starting dosage strength of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, consider the patients’ disease severity, based on their previous asthma therapy, including the ICS dosage, as well as the patients’ current control of asthma symptoms and risk of future exacerbation.</p><p>The maximum recommended dosage is Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS inhalation powder 500/50 mcg twice daily.</p><p>Improvement in asthma control following inhaled administration of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS can occur within 30 minutes of beginning treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 week or longer after starting treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief.</p><p>For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dosage after 2 weeks of therapy, replacing the current strength of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS with a higher strength may provide additional improvement in asthma control.</p><p>If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide adequate improvement in asthma control, the therapeutic regimen should be reevaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g., replacing the current strength of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS with a higher strength, adding additional ICS, initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients Aged 4 to 11 Years</span></p><p>For patients with asthma aged 4 to 11 years who are not controlled on an ICS, the dosage is 1 inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS inhalation powder 100/50 mcg twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart.</p><h3>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage for patients with COPD is 1 inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS inhalation powder 250/50 mcg twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart.</p><p>If shortness of breath occurs in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist should be taken for immediate relief.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Inhalation powder: Inhaler containing a foil blister strip of powder formulation for oral inhalation. The strip contains a combination of fluticasone propionate 100, 250, or 500 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg per blister.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">The use of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS is contraindicated in the following conditions:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Serious Asthma-Related Events – Hospitalizations, Intubations, Death</h3><p class="First">Use of LABA as monotherapy (without ICS) for asthma is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death <span class="Italics">[see Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART)]</span>. Available data from controlled clinical trials also suggest that use of LABA as monotherapy increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. These findings are considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy. When LABA are used in fixed-dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma‑related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone <span class="Italics">(see Serious Asthma-Related Events with Inhaled Corticosteroid/Long-acting Beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic Agonists)</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Serious Asthma-Related Events with Inhaled Corticosteroid/Long-acting Beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic Agonists</span></p><p>Four (4) large, 26-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical safety trials were conducted to evaluate the risk of serious asthma-related events when LABA were used in fixed-dose combination with ICS compared with ICS alone in subjects with asthma. Three (3) trials included adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older: 1 trial compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>, 1 trial compared mometasone furoate/formoterol with mometasone furoate, and 1 trial compared budesonide/formoterol with budesonide. The fourth trial included pediatric subjects aged 4 to 11 years and compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>. The primary safety endpoint for all 4 trials was serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death). A blinded adjudication committee determined whether events were asthma related.</p><p>The 3 adult and adolescent trials were designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.0, and the pediatric trial was designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.7. Each individual trial met its pre-specified objective and demonstrated non-inferiority of ICS/LABA to ICS alone. A meta-analysis of the 3 adult and adolescent trials did not show a significant increase in risk of a serious asthma-related event with ICS/LABA fixed-dose combination compared with ICS alone (Table 1). These trials were not designed to rule out all risk for serious asthma-related events with ICS/LABA compared with ICS.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ICS/LABA</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 17,537)<span class="Sup">a</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ICS</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 17,552)<span class="Sup">a</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ICS/LABA vs. ICS</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Hazard Ratio</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(95% CI)<span class="Sup">b</span></span></p><p class="First">Serious asthma-related event<span class="Sup">c</span></p><p class="First">116</p><p class="First">105</p><p class="First">1.10 (0.85, 1.44)</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">115</p><p class="First">105</p><p>The pediatric safety trial included 6,208 pediatric subjects aged 4 to 11 years who received ICS/LABA (fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder) or ICS (fluticasone propionate inhalation powder). In this trial, 27/3,107 (0.9%) subjects randomized to ICS/LABA and 21/3,101 (0.7%) subjects randomized to ICS experienced a serious asthma-related event. There were no asthma-related deaths or intubations. ICS/LABA did not show a significantly increased risk of a serious asthma-related event compared with ICS based on the pre-specified risk margin (2.7), with an estimated hazard ratio of time to first event of 1.29 (95% CI: 0.73, 2.27).</p><p><span class="Bold">Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART)</span></p><p>A 28-week, placebo-controlled, U.S. trial that compared the safety of salmeterol with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in subjects treated with salmeterol versus 3/13,179 in subjects treated with placebo; relative risk: 4.37 [95% CI: 1.25, 15.34]). Use of background ICS was not required in SMART. The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy.</p><h3>Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes</h3><p class="First">Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of asthma or COPD. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating asthma or COPD. The initiation of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS in this setting is not appropriate.</p><p>Serious acute respiratory events, including fatalities, have been reported when salmeterol, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, has been initiated in patients with significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. In most cases, these have occurred in patients with severe asthma (e.g., patients with a history of corticosteroid dependence, low pulmonary function, intubation, mechanical ventilation, frequent hospitalizations, previous life‑threatening acute asthma exacerbations) and in some patients with acutely deteriorating asthma (e.g., patients with significantly increasing symptoms; increasing need for inhaled, short‑acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists; decreasing response to usual medications; increasing need for systemic corticosteroids; recent emergency room visits; deteriorating lung function). However, these events have occurred in a few patients with less severe asthma as well. It was not possible from these reports to determine whether salmeterol contributed to these events.</p><p>Increasing use of inhaled, short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma. In this situation, the patient requires immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for replacing the current strength of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS with a higher strength, adding additional ICS, or initiating systemic corticosteroids. Patients should not use more than 1 inhalation twice daily of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS.</p><p>Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist.</p><p>When beginning treatment with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs.</p><h3>Excessive Use of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS and Use with Other Long-acting Beta2-agonists</h3><p class="First">Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason.</p><h3>Local Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with <span class="Italics">Candida albicans</span> has occurred in subjects treated with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS continues, but at times therapy with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing following inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.</p><h3>Pneumonia</h3><p class="First">Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbations frequently overlap.</p><p>Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, have been reported in patients with COPD following the inhaled administration of corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS. In 2 replicate 1-year trials in 1,579 subjects with COPD, there was a higher incidence of pneumonia reported in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS 250/50 mcg (7%) than in those receiving salmeterol 50 mcg (3%). The incidence of pneumonia in the subjects treated with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS was higher in subjects older than 65 years (9%) compared with the incidence in subjects younger than 65 years (4%). <span class="Italics">[See Adverse Reactions (6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.5).]</span></p><p>In a 3-year trial in 6,184 subjects with COPD, there was a higher incidence of pneumonia reported in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS 500/50 mcg compared with placebo (16% with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS 500/50 mcg, 14% with fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, 11% with salmeterol 50 mcg, and 9% with placebo). Similar to what was seen in the 1-year trials with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS 250/50 mcg, the incidence of pneumonia was higher in subjects older than 65 years (18% with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS 500/50 mcg versus 10% with placebo) compared with subjects younger than 65 years (14% with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS 500/50 mcg versus 8% with placebo). <span class="Italics">[See Adverse Reactions (6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.5).]</span></p><h3>Immunosuppression</h3><p class="First">Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</p><p>ICS should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.</p><h3>Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy</h3><p class="First">Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to ICS because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available ICS. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.</p><p>Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS may control asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.</p><p>During periods of stress or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack.</p><p>Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>] or morning peak expiratory flow [AM PEF]), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.</p><p>Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions).</p><p>During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.</p><h3>Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression</h3><p class="First">Fluticasone propionate, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since fluticasone propionate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. A relationship between plasma levels of fluticasone propionate and inhibitory effects on stimulated cortisol production has been shown after 4 weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS.</p><p>Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of ICS in sensitive patients, patients treated with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.</p><p>It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids, and other treatments for management of asthma symptoms should be considered.</p><h3>Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">The use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid and increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms</h3><p class="First">As with other inhaled medicines, Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted. Upper airway symptoms of laryngeal spasm, irritation, or swelling, such as stridor and choking, have been reported in patients receiving fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS.</p><h3>Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), including anaphylaxis, may occur after administration of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of powder products containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Cardiovascular and Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">Excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation has been associated with seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10.2)]</span>. Therefore, Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, like all products containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.</p><p>Salmeterol, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of salmeterol at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Large doses of inhaled or oral salmeterol (12 to 20 times the recommended dose) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias. Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.</p><h3>Reduction in Bone Mineral Density</h3><p class="First">Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing ICS. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids), should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. Since patients with COPD often have multiple risk factors for reduced BMD, assessment of BMD is recommended prior to initiating Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS and periodically thereafter. If significant reductions in BMD are seen and Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS is still considered medically important for that patient’s COPD therapy, use of medicine to treat or prevent osteoporosis should be strongly considered.</p><p><span class="Bold">2-Year Fluticasone Propionate Trial</span></p><p>A 2-year trial in 160 subjects (females aged 18 to 40 years, males 18 to 50) with asthma receiving chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-propelled fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol 88 or 440 mcg twice daily demonstrated no statistically significant changes in BMD at any time point (24, 52, 76, and 104 weeks of double-blind treatment) as assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at lumbar regions L1 through L4.</p><p><span class="Bold">3-Year Bone Mineral Density Trial</span></p><p>Effects of treatment with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS 250/50 mcg or salmeterol 50 mcg on BMD at the L<span class="Sub">1</span>-L<span class="Sub">4</span> lumbar spine and total hip were evaluated in 186 subjects with COPD (aged 43 to 87 years) in a 3-year double-blind trial. Of those enrolled, 108 subjects (72 males and 36 females) were followed for the entire 3 years. BMD evaluations were conducted at baseline and at 6-month intervals. Conclusions cannot be drawn from this trial regarding BMD decline in subjects treated with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS versus salmeterol due to the inconsistency of treatment differences across gender and between lumbar spine and total hip.</p><p>In this trial there were 7 non-traumatic fractures reported in 5 subjects treated with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS and 1 non-traumatic fracture in 1 subject treated with salmeterol. None of the non-traumatic fractures occurred in the vertebrae, hip, or long bones.</p><p><span class="Bold">3-Year Survival Trial</span></p><p>Effects of treatment with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS 500/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, salmeterol 50 mcg, or placebo on BMD was evaluated in a subset of 658 subjects (females and males aged 40 to 80 years) with COPD in the 3-year survival trial. BMD evaluations were conducted at baseline and at 48, 108, and 158 weeks. Conclusions cannot be drawn from this trial because of the large number of dropouts (&gt;50%) before the end of the follow-up and the maldistribution of covariates among the treatment groups that can affect BMD.</p><p>Fracture risk was estimated for the entire population of subjects with COPD in the survival trial (N = 6,184). The probability of a fracture over 3 years was 6.3% for fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS, 5.4% for fluticasone propionate, 5.1% for salmeterol, and 5.1% for placebo.</p><h3>Effect on Growth</h3><p class="First">Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, titrate each patient’s dosage to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Glaucoma and Cataracts</h3><p class="First">Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients with asthma and COPD following the long-term administration of ICS, including fluticasone propionate, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS. <span class="following_xmChange">Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS long term.</span></p><p>Effects of treatment with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS 500/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, salmeterol 50 mcg, or placebo on development of cataracts or glaucoma was evaluated in a subset of 658 subjects with COPD in the 3-year survival trial. Ophthalmic examinations were conducted at baseline and at 48, 108, and 158 weeks. Conclusions about cataracts cannot be drawn from this trial because the high incidence of cataracts at baseline (61% to 71%) resulted in an inadequate number of subjects treated with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS 500/50 mcg who were eligible and available for evaluation of cataracts at the end of the trial (n = 53). The incidence of newly diagnosed glaucoma was 2% with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS 500/50 mcg, 5% with fluticasone propionate, 0% with salmeterol, and 2% with placebo.</p><h3>Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome</h3><p class="First">In rare cases, patients on inhaled fluticasone propionate, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of fluticasone propionate. Cases of serious eosinophilic conditions have also been reported with other ICS in this clinical setting. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between fluticasone propionate and these underlying conditions has not been established.</p><h3>Coexisting Conditions</h3><p class="First">Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, like all medicines containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.</p><h3>Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia</h3><p class="First">Beta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation.

The mean age of the subjects was 65 years, and the majority (82%) was Caucasian. The distribution of adverse events was similar to that seen in the 1-year trials with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS 250/50 mcg. In addition, pneumonia was reported in a significantly increased number of subjects treated with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS 500/50 mcg and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg (16% and 14%, respectively) compared with subjects treated with salmeterol 50 mcg or placebo (11% and 9%, respectively).

No formal drug interaction trials have been performed with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS.</p><h3>Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4</h3><p class="First">Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol, the individual components of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, are substrates of CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid and increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur.</p><p><span class="Bold">Ritonavir</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Fluticasone Propionate:</span> A drug interaction trial with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray in healthy subjects has shown that ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression.</p><p><span class="Bold">Ketoconazole</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Fluticasone Propionate:</span> Coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in a 1.9-fold increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure and a 45% decrease in plasma cortisol area under the curve (AUC), but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol.</p><p><span class="Italics">Salmeterol:</span> In a drug interaction trial in 20 healthy subjects, coadministration of inhaled salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and oral ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in greater systemic exposure to salmeterol (AUC increased 16-fold and C<span class="Sub">max</span> increased 1.4-fold). Three (3) subjects were withdrawn due to beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist side effects (2 with prolonged QTc and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration.</p><h3>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants</h3><p class="First">Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of salmeterol, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, on the vascular system may be potentiated by these agents.</p><h3>Beta-adrenergic Receptor Blocking Agents</h3><p class="First">Beta-blockers not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as salmeterol, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma or COPD. Therefore, patients with asthma or COPD should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents for these patients; cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.</p><h3>Non–Potassium-Sparing Diuretics</h3><p class="First">The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non–potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, such as salmeterol, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS with non–potassium-sparing diuretics.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are insufficient data on the use of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS or individual monoproducts, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate, in pregnant women.

Oral administration of salmeterol to pregnant rabbits caused teratogenicity characteristic of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation at maternal doses approximately 50 times the MRHDID on an AUC basis. These adverse effects generally occurred at large multiples of the MRHDID when salmeterol was administered by the oral route to achieve high systemic exposures. No such effects occurred at an oral salmeterol dose approximately 20 times the MRHDID. <span class="Italics">(See Data.)</span></p><p>The estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

The mechanisms of action described below for the individual components apply to Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS. These drugs represent 2 different classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a LABA) that have different effects on clinical, physiologic, and inflammatory indices.</p><p><span class="Bold">Fluticasone Propionate</span></p><p>Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.</p><p>Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma.</p><p>Inflammation is also a component in the pathogenesis of COPD. In contrast to asthma, however, the predominant inflammatory cells in COPD include neutrophils, CD8+ T-lymphocytes, and macrophages. The effects of corticosteroids in the treatment of COPD are not well defined and ICS and fluticasone propionate when used apart from Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS are not indicated for the treatment of COPD.</p><p><span class="Bold">Salmeterol Xinafoate</span></p><p>Salmeterol is a selective LABA. In vitro studies show salmeterol to be at least 50 times more selective for beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenoceptors than albuterol. Although beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenoceptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists may have cardiac effects.</p><p>The pharmacologic effects of beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including salmeterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.</p><p>In vitro tests show that salmeterol is a potent and long-lasting inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D<span class="Sub">2</span>, from human lung. Salmeterol inhibits histamine-induced plasma protein extravasation and inhibits platelet-activating factor-induced eosinophil accumulation in the lungs of guinea pigs when administered by the inhaled route. In humans, single doses of salmeterol administered via inhalation aerosol attenuate allergen-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Healthy Subjects: Cardiovascular Effects:</span> Since systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol are not normally seen at the therapeutic dose, higher doses were used to produce measurable effects.

In these trials no significant differences were observed in the pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol (pulse rate, blood pressure, QTc interval, potassium, and glucose) whether the salmeterol was given as fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS, concurrently with fluticasone propionate from separate inhalers, or as salmeterol alone. The systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol were not altered by the presence of fluticasone propionate in fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS.

Available data show that when ICS and LABA are used together, such as with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DISKUS, there is not a significant increase in the risk of these events.</p><p><span class="Bold">Not for Acute Symptoms</span></p><p>Inform patients that Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS is not meant to relieve acute asthma symptoms or exacerbations of COPD and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Advise patients to treat acute symptoms with an inhaled, short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>‑agonist such as albuterol. Provide patients with such medication and instruct them in how it should be used.</p><p>Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately if they experience any of the following:</p><p>Tell patients they should not stop therapy with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS without physician/provider guidance since symptoms may recur after discontinuation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Do Not Use Additional Long-acting Beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists</span></p><p>Instruct patients not to use other LABA for asthma and COPD.</p><p><span class="Bold">Local Effects</span></p><p>Inform patients that localized infections with <span class="Italics">Candida albicans</span> occurred in the mouth and pharynx in some patients. If oropharyngeal candidiasis develops, treat it with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while still continuing therapy with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, but at times therapy with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS may need to be temporarily interrupted under close medical supervision. Advise patients to rinse the mouth with water without swallowing after inhalation to help reduce the risk of thrush.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pneumonia</span></p><p>Patients with COPD have a higher risk of pneumonia; instruct them to contact their healthcare providers if they develop symptoms of pneumonia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immunosuppression</span></p><p>Warn patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed, to consult their physicians without delay. Inform patients of potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression</span></p><p>Advise patients that Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS may cause systemic corticosteroid effects of hypercorticism and adrenal suppression. Additionally, inform patients that deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids. Patients should taper slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions</span></p><p>Advise patients that immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), including anaphylaxis, may occur after administration of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS. Patients should discontinue Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS if such reactions occur. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of powder products containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not take Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS.</p><p><span class="Bold">Reduction in Bone Mineral Density</span></p><p>Advise patients who are at an increased risk for decreased BMD that the use of corticosteroids may pose an additional risk.</p><p><span class="Bold">Reduced Growth Velocity</span></p><p>Inform patients that orally inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Physicians should closely follow the growth of children and adolescents taking corticosteroids by any route.</p><p><span class="Bold">Glaucoma and Cataracts</span></p><p>Advise patients that long-term use of ICS may increase the risk of some eye problems (cataracts or glaucoma); consider regular eye examinations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks Associated with Beta-agonist Therapy</span></p><p>Inform patients of adverse effects associated with beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists, such as palpitations, chest pain, rapid heart rate, tremor, or nervousness.</p><p>Trademarks are owned by or licensed to the GSK group of companies.</p><p>Manufactured for:</p><p><span class="Bold">Prasco Laboratories</span></p><p>Mason, OH 45040 USA</p><p>Manufactured by:</p><p>GlaxoSmithKline</p><p>Research Triangle Park, NC 27709</p><p>ADD-PS:6PI</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PATIENT INFORMATION</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS inhalation powder</span></p><p><span class="Bold">for oral inhalation use</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">What is Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS?</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Do not use Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS:</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Before using Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol DISKUS, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,</span> including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
