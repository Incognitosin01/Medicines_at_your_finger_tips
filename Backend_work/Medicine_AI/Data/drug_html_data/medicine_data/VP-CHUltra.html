</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION:</span> VP CH Ultra is an orally administered PRENATAL/POSTNATAL prescription folate specifically formulated for the dietary management of patients with unique nutritional needs requiring increased folate levels.</p><p>VP CH Ultra should be administered under the supervision of a licensed medical practitioner.</p><p>Each (oblong, purple) softgel contains the following dietary ingredients:</p><p><span class="Italics">Daily Values not established for patients with unique nutritional needs who are in need of supplementation as directed by a licensed medical practitioner.</span></p><p class="First">Other Ingredients: Carmine, Ethyl Vanillin, FD&amp;C Blue #1, FD&amp;C Red #40, Gelatin, Glycerin, Natural Creamy Orange Flavor, Purified Water, Soybean Oil, Soy Lecithin, Titanium Dioxide, Yellow Beeswax and other ancillary ingredients as needed to ensure product stability.</p><p><span class="Bold">CAUTION:</span> This product contains FD&amp;C Blue #1 and FD&amp;C Red #40.</p><p>Carmine haraam for Muslims.</p><p><span class="Bold">This product contains soy, fish (tuna) and/or algal.</span> This product also contains carmine and bovine gelatin.</p><p>Since additives, preservatives, bioavailability enhances, colors and/or flavors of natural origin, etc. are preferred over synthetics, it may be the case that product color, appearance and/or taste may vary slightly over time; and it may be necessary to substitute excipients during the manufacturing process as needed to preserve product appearance and continuity in order to avoid confusion in the marketplace and ensure the highest therapeutic target, safety and quality.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOLATE MECHANISM OF ACTION:</span> FOLATE is essential for the production of certain coenzymes in many metabolic systems such as purine and pyrimidine synthesis. It is also essential in the synthesis and maintenance of nucleoprotein in erythropoiesis. It also promotes white blood cell (WBC) and platelet production in folate-deficiency anemia. Folate is associated with methylation and transformylation biochemistry.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOLATE REGULATION:</span> The Federal Register Notices from 1971 to 1973 established that increased folate was proper therapy in megaloblastic anemias of tropical and nontropical sprue, nutritional origin, pregnancy, infancy and childhood<span class="Sup">4,5,6</span>. Folate metabolism can be affected by malabsorption issues which differ widely among population groups. The March 5, 1996 Federal Register Notice (61 FR 8760) states that “The agency concluded that <span class="Bold Italics">the scientific literature did not support the superiority of any one source of folate over others, and that the data were insufficient to provide a basis for stating that a specific amount of folate is more effective than another amount</span> [emphasis added]<span class="Sup">9,10”</span>. The actual amount and source of folate require a licensed medical practitioner’s supervision to achieve a satisfactory maintenance level, and may exceed the 0.8 mg UL. The Federal Register Notice of August 2, 1973 (38 FR 20750) specifically states that “dietary supplement preparations are available without a prescription (21 CFR 121.1134). <span class="Bold Italics">Levels higher than dietary supplement amounts are available only with a prescription. Oral preparations supplying more than 0.8 mg of folate per dosage unit would be restricted to prescription dispensing</span> and that a dietary supplement furnishing 0.8 mg <span class="Italics">could be</span> prescribed when a maintenance level of 0.8 mg per day was indicated. When clinical symptoms have subsided and the blood picture and/or CSF folate levels have become normal, a maintenance level should be used. Patients should be kept under close supervision and adjustment of the maintenance level made if relapse appears imminent. In the presence of alcoholism, hemolytic anemia, anticonvulsant therapy, or chronic infection, the maintenance level may need to be increased [emphasis added]<span class="Sup">7</span>.” However, once the level of active folate exceeds 0.8 mg - as prescribed dosages, then the product is no longer a medical food but a <span class="Bold">dietary management / prescription (R<span class="Sub">x</span>)-folate</span> regardless of pregnancy/lactation status in spite of the fact that folic acid - including reduced forms, may be added to medical foods as defined in section 5(b)(3) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 USC 360ee(b)(3)), or to food (21 CFR 172.345)<span class="Sup">11</span>. In the Letter Regarding Dietary Supplement Health Claim for Folic Acid, Vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span>, and Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> and Vascular Disease (Docket No. 99P-3029) dated November 28, 2000, FDA wrote “... high intakes of folate may partially and temporarily correct pernicious anemia while the neurological damage of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency progresses. IOM/NAS (1998) set the UL for all adults of 1 mg per day because of devastating and irreversible neurological consequences of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency, the data suggesting that <span class="Bold Italics">pernicious anemia may develop at a younger age in some racial or ethnic groups, and the uncertainty about the extent of the occurrence of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency in <span class="Bold">younger age groups</span></span> (IOM/NAS, 1998) [emphasis added]<span class="Sup">8</span>.” Summary: This product is a dietary management product that - due to advanced folate levels, requires administration under the care of a licensed medical practitioner, and the most appropriate way to do that is to provide the product as prescription for pedigree reporting and safety monitoring. The ingredients, indication or claims of this product are not to be construed to be drug claims.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ALLERGY STATEMENT:</span> This product has been manufactured in a facility that also manufactures products containing tree nuts, peanuts, fish, egg, wheat, milk, soy and shellfish. Individuals with allergic tendencies to these substances should use discretion.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INTERACTIONS:</span> Talk to your healthcare practitioner and/or pharmacist before taking or using any prescription or over-the-counter medicines or herbal/health supplements alongside <span class="Bold">this product</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS: This product</span> is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components contained in this product. <span class="Bold">This product</span> is contraindicated for individuals with conditions for which any of the ingredients are contraindicated.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span> Caution is recommended in patients with a history of bipolar illness. Mood elevation is possible in this population.</p><p>Caution is also recommended in patients taking anticonvulsant medications as folate may interfere with anticonvulsant medication, and may lower seizure threshold. Furthermore, it has been reported that anticonvulsant medications interfere with folate metabolism, but the exact action is unclear; therefore caution is recommended with patients in this therapeutic group.</p><p>Folinic acid may enhance the toxicity of fluorouracil. Deaths from severe enterocolitis, diarrhea, and dehydration have been reported in elderly patients receiving weekly formyl-THF and fluorouracil. Concomitant granulocytopenia and fever were present in some but not all of the patients. The concomitant use of formyl-THF with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the acute treatment of <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis carinii</span> pneumonia in patients with HIV infection was associated with increased rates of treatment failure and mortality in a placebo controlled study.<span class="Sup">13</span></p><p>Patients undergoing cancer treatment should consult their licensed medical practitioner for advice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> Folate alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is deficient. Folate in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations progress.</p><p>Daily ingestion of more than 3 grams per day of omega-3 fatty acids (ALA, EPA, and DHA) may have potential antithrombotic activities, or effects, and may increase bleeding times. Administration of omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA, should be avoided in patients with inherited or acquired bleeding diathesis, including those taking anticoagulants. Exercise caution to ensure that the prescribed dosage of DHA does not exceed 1 gram (1000 mg) per day.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS:</span> Allergic reactions have been reported following the use of oral and parenteral folate. Mild transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, itching, transitory exanthema and the feeling of swelling of the entire body has been associated with cobalamin. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, transient skin rash, flushing, epigastric pain, and constipation have been associated with acetylcysteine.</p><p>Call your medical practitioner about side effects.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PHARMACOLOGY:</span> <span class="Bold">FOLATE</span> - Folates are best known for reducing the incidence of fetal neural tube defects (NTDs). NTDs are congenital malformations produced by failure of the neural tube to form and close properly during embryonic development.<span class="Sup">3</span> During the first four weeks of pregnancy - when many women do not even realize that they have conceived, adequate maternal folate intake is essential to reduce the risk of NTDs. As the postnatal period approaches there is increased demand again for folate regardless of lactation status. Folate is involved in transformylation and methylation metabolism as well as - indirectly, succinylation metabolism (through the “methyl trap” hypothesis). Folate plays a central role in the formation of nucleic acid precursors, such as thymidylic acid and purine nucleotides, which are essential for nucleic acid synthesis and cell division. IOM/NAS (1998) noted that the evidence for a protective effect from folate supplements is much stronger than that for food folate<span class="Sup">10</span>. Other dietary ingredients are added to folate as cofactors, coenzymes and co-metabolites; in studies by Czeizel and Dudas (1992) and Berry et al. (1999), factors other than folate intakes may affect the magnitude of risk reduction or participate in a co-protective effect with folate<span class="Sup">10</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">KEEP THIS PRODUCT OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.</span></p><h2>REFERENCES:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</span> VP CH Ultra is indicated for the distinct nutritional requirements of patients in need of PRENATAL/POSTNATAL dietary supplementation as determined by a licensed medical practitioner.</p><p>VP CH Ultra should be administered under the supervision of a licensed medical practitioner.</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING:</span> Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</p><p><span class="Bold">WARNING:</span> Ingestion of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day has been shown to have potential antithrombotic effects, including an increased bleeding time and INR. Administration of omega-3 fatty acids should be avoided in patients on anticoagulants and in those known to have an inherited or acquired bleeding diathesis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> General: Folate, when administered as a single agent in doses about 0.1 mg daily, may obscure the detection of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency (specifically, the administration of folic acid may reverse the hematological manifestations of B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency, including pernicious anemia, while not addressing the neurological manifestations). Folate therapy alone is inadequate for treatment of a vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CAUTION:</span> Exercise caution to ensure that the prescribed dosage of DHA does not exceed 1 gram (1000 mg) per day.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PATIENT INFORMATION:</span> VP CH Ultra is a PRENATAL/POSTNATAL prescription folate to be used only under licensed medical supervision.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DRUG INTERACTIONS:</span> Drugs which may interact with folate1 include:</p><ul>
<li>Antiepileptic drugs (AED): The AED class including, but not limited to, phenytoin, carbamazepine, primidone, valproic acid, fosphenytoin, valproate, phenobarbital and lamotrigine have been shown to impair folate absorption and increase the metabolism of circulating folate.</li>
<li>Additionally, concurrent use of folic acid has been associated with enhanced phenytoin metabolism, lowering the level of the AED in the blood and allowing breakthrough seizures to occur. Caution should be used when prescribing this product among patients who are receiving treatment with phenytoin and other anticonvulsants.</li>
<li>Capecitabine: Folinic acid (5-formyltetrahydrofolate) may increase the toxicity of capecitabine.</li>
<li>Cholestyramine: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.</li>
<li>Colestipol: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.</li>
<li>Cycloserine: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.</li>
<li>Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitors (DHFRI): DHFRIs block the conversion of folic acid to its active forms, and lower plasma and red blood cell folate levels. DHFRIs include aminopterin, methotrexate, pyrimethamine, triamterene, and trimethoprim.</li>
<li>Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine exerts a noncompetitive inhibition of the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate active transport in the intestine.</li>
<li>Isotretinoin: Reduced folate levels have occurred in some patients taking isotretinoin.</li>
<li>L-dopa, triamterene, colchicine, and trimethoprim may decrease plasma folate levels.</li>
<li>Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs have been shown to inhibit some folate dependent enzymes in laboratory experiments.</li>
<li>NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin and sulindac.</li>
<li>Oral Contraceptives: Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy.</li>
<li>Methylprednisolone: Reduced serum folate levels have been noted after treatment with methylprednisolone.</li>
<li>Pancreatic Enzymes: Reduced folate levels have occurred in some patients taking pancreatic extracts, such as pancreatin and pancrelipase.</li>
<li>Pentamidine: Reduced folate levels have been seen with prolonged intravenous pentamidine.</li>
<li>Pyrimethamine: High levels of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of pyrimethamine.</li>
<li>Smoking and Alcohol: Reduced serum folate levels have been noted.</li>
<li>Sulfasalazine: Inhibits the absorption and metabolism of folic acid.</li>
<li>Metformin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes decreases serum folate.</li>
<li>Warfarin can produce significant impairment in folate status after a 6-month therapy.</li>
<li>Heme-iron: Can compete for transport and reduce folate absorption.</li>
<li>Folinic acid may enhance the toxicity of fluorouracil.</li>
<li>Concurrent administration of chloramphenicol and folinic acid in folate-deficient patients may result in antagonism of the haematopoietic response to folate.</li>
<li>Caution should be exercised with the concomitant use of folinic acid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the acute treatment of <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis carinii</span> pneumonia in patients with HIV infection as it is associated with increased rates of treatment failure and mortality in a placebo controlled study.</li>
</ul><h2>Drugs which interact with vitamin B6:</h2><ul>
<li>Vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span> should not be given to patients receiving the drug levodopa because the action of levodopa is antagonized by vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span>. However, vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span> may be used concurrently in patients receiving a preparation containing both carbidopa and levodopa.</li>
<li>Isoniazid can produce a vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span> deficiency.</li>
</ul><h2>Drugs which may interact with vitamin D3:</h2><ul>
<li>Certain thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide, as well as antacids, bile acid sequestrants (such as cholestyramine), mineral oil, orlistat, olestra, cimetidine, and anticonvulsant medications may reduce the absorption or increase the catabolism of vitamin D.</li>
<li>Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones.</li>
