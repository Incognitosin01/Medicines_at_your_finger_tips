Make sure any doctor caring for you afterward knows you received this medicine.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>If possible before you receive Corlopam, tell your caregivers if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>glaucoma;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>low levels of potassium in your blood; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>asthma or a sulfite allergy.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>glaucoma;</p><p>low levels of potassium in your blood; or</p><p>asthma or a sulfite allergy.</p><p>It is not known whether Corlopam will harm an unborn baby. However, having high blood pressure during pregnancy may cause complications such as diabetes or eclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure that can lead to medical problems in both mother and baby). The benefit of treating hypertension may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p>You should not breastfeed while you are receiving Corlopam.</p><p>In an emergency, you may not be able to tell caregivers if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Make sure any doctor caring for your pregnancy or your baby knows you received  Corlopam.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is  Corlopam given?</h2><p>Corlopam is given as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>Corlopam is usually given only until your blood pressure is normal again.</p><p>Once your blood pressure has become stable, you may be given other medicine to help keep your blood pressure from getting too high. <b>Keep using your blood pressure medicine as directed, even if you feel well.</b> High blood pressure often has no symptoms. You may need to use blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life.</p><p>After you are treated with Corlopam, your blood pressure may need to be checked often. Follow your doctor's instructions about how to keep your blood pressure from getting too high.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Because you will receive  Corlopam as a continuous infusion in an emergency setting, you are not likely to miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since  Corlopam is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur. Tell your caregivers if you feel very light-headed during the Corlopam infusion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while receiving  Corlopam?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Corlopam side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Corlopam may cause you to have fast heartbeats, or a light-headed feeling (like you might pass out).</p><p>After treatment, call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
