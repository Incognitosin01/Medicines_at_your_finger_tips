</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Timentin Injection</h2><p class="First">TIMENTIN<span class="Sup">®</span> is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible isolates of the designated bacteria in the conditions listed below:</p><h3>Septicemia</h3><p class="First">Septicemia (including bacteremia) caused by β‑lactamase–producing isolates of <span class="Italics">Klebsiella</span> spp.<span class="Sup">*</span>, <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span><span class="Sup">*</span>, <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span><span class="Sup">*</span>, or <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span><span class="Sup">*</span> (or other <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas</span> species<span class="Sup">*</span>)</p><h3>Lower Respiratory Infections</h3><p class="First">Lower respiratory infections caused by β‑lactamase–producing isolates of <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span>, <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span><span class="Sup">*</span>, or <span class="Italics">Klebsiella</span> spp.<span class="Sup">*</span></p><h3>Bone and Joint Infections</h3><p class="First">Bone and joint infections caused by β‑lactamase–producing isolates of <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span></p><h3>Skin and Skin Structure Infections</h3><p class="First">Skin and skin structure infections caused by β‑lactamase–producing isolates of <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span>, <span class="Italics">Klebsiella</span> spp.<span class="Sup">*</span>, or <span class="Italics">E. coli</span><span class="Sup">*</span></p><h3>Urinary Tract Infections</h3><p class="First">Urinary tract infections (complicated and uncomplicated) caused by β‑lactamase–producing isolates of <span class="Italics">E. coli</span>, <span class="Italics">Klebsiella</span> spp., <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span><span class="Sup">*</span> (or other <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas</span> spp.<span class="Sup">*</span>), <span class="Italics">Citrobacter</span> spp.<span class="Sup">*</span>, <span class="Italics">Enterobacter cloacae</span><span class="Sup">*</span>, <span class="Italics">Serratia marcescens</span><span class="Sup">*</span>, or <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span><span class="Sup">*</span></p><h3>Gynecologic Infections</h3><p class="First">Endometritis caused by β‑lactamase–producing isolates of <span class="Italics">Prevotella melaninogenicus</span><span class="Sup">*</span>, <span class="Italics">Enterobacter</span> spp. (including <span class="Italics">E. cloacae</span><span class="Sup">*</span>), <span class="Italics">E. coli</span>, <span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span><span class="Sup">*</span>, <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span>, or <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span></p><h3>Intra-abdominal Infections</h3><p class="First">Peritonitis caused by β‑lactamase–producing isolates of <span class="Italics">E. coli</span>, <span class="Italics">K. pneumoniae</span>, or <span class="Italics">Bacteroides fragilis</span><span class="Sup">*</span> group</p><p>* Efficacy for this organism in this organ system was studied in fewer than 10 infections.</p><h3>Usage</h3><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug‑resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of TIMENTIN and other antibacterial drugs, TIMENTIN should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Timentin Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Adults</h3><p class="First">The usual recommended dosage for systemic and urinary tract infections for adults is 3.1 grams of TIMENTIN (3 grams ticarcillin and 100 mg clavulanic acid) given every 4 to 6 hours.</p><p>For gynecologic infections, TIMENTIN should be administered as follows (based on ticarcillin content): Moderate infections, 200 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 6 hours; severe infections, 300 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 4 hours.</p><p>For patients weighing less than 60 kg, the recommended dosage is 200 to 300 mg/kg/day given in divided doses every 4 to 6 hours.</p><p>The duration of therapy depends upon the severity of infection. The usual duration is 10 to 14 days; however, in difficult and complicated infections, more prolonged therapy may be required.</p><h3>Pediatric Patients (≥3 Months of Age)</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients &lt;60 kg:</span> Mild to moderate infections, 200 mg/kg/day based on ticarcillin content in divided doses every 6 hours; severe infections, 300 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 4 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients ≥60 kg:</span> Mild to moderate infections, 3.1 grams every 6 hours; severe infections, 3.1 grams every 4 hours.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">For patients with renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 3.1 grams should be followed by doses based on creatinine clearance and type of dialysis as indicated in Table 1.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Creatinine Clearance (mL/minute)<span class="Sup">a</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dosage<span class="Sup">b</span></span></p><p class="First">Over 60</p><p class="First">3 grams every 4 hours</p><p class="First">30 to 60</p><p class="First">2 grams every 4 hours</p><p class="First">10 to 30</p><p class="First">2 grams every 8 hours</p><p class="First">Less than 10</p><p class="First">2 grams every 12 hours</p><p class="First">Less than 10 with hepatic dysfunction</p><p class="First">2 grams every 24 hours</p><p class="First">Patients on peritoneal dialysis</p><p class="First">3 grams every 12 hours</p><p class="First">Patients on hemodialysis</p><p class="First">2 grams every 12 hours supplemented with 3 grams after each dialysis</p><p><span class="Sup">a</span> To calculate creatinine clearance<span class="Sup">1</span> from a serum creatinine value use the following formula:</p><p>C<span class="Sub">cr</span> = <span class="Bold">(140–Age) (weight in kg)/</span>72 x S<span class="Sub">cr</span> (mg/100 mL)</p><p>This is the calculated creatinine clearance for adult males; for females it is 15% less.</p><p><span class="Sup">b</span> Based on ticarcillin content.</p><h3>Administration and Directions for Use</h3><p class="First">TIMENTIN should be administered by intravenous infusion over a 30-minute period.</p><p><span class="Bold">Directions for Reconstitution and Further Dilution:</span> <span class="Italics">3.1</span>‑<span class="Italics">gram Glass Vials:</span> The 3.1‑gram vial should be reconstituted by adding approximately 13 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, and shaking well. When dissolved, the concentration of ticarcillin will be approximately 200 mg/mL with a corresponding concentration of 6.7 mg/mL for clavulanic acid. The color of reconstituted solutions of TIMENTIN normally ranges from light to dark yellow, depending on concentration, duration, and temperature of storage.</p><p>The dissolved drug should be further diluted to desired volume using the recommended solution listed under Stability <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span> to a concentration between 10 mg/mL to 100 mg/mL.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pharmacy Bulk Package:</span> The container closure may be penetrated only one time utilizing a suitable sterile transfer device or dispensing set that allows measured distribution of the contents. A sterile substance that must be reconstituted prior to use may require a separate closure entry.</p><p>Restrict use of Pharmacy Bulk Packages to an aseptic area such as a laminar flow hood.</p><p>Reconstituted contents of the vial should be withdrawn immediately. However, if this is not possible, aliquoting operations must be completed within 4 hours of reconstitution. Discard the reconstituted stock solution 4 hours after initial entry.</p><p>Add 76 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to the 31‑gram Pharmacy Bulk Package and shake well. For ease of reconstitution, the diluent may be added in 2 portions. Each 1 mL of the resulting concentrated stock solution contains approximately 300 mg of ticarcillin and 10 mg of clavulanic acid.</p><p>The desired dosage should be withdrawn from the stock solution and further diluted to desired volume using the recommended solution listed under Stability <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span> to a concentration between 10 mg/mL to 100 mg/mL.</p><p><span class="Bold">Directions for Intravenous Infusion:</span> After reconstitution and further dilution and prior to administration, TIMENTIN should be inspected visually for particulate matter. If particulate matter is present, the solution should be discarded.</p><p>The solution of reconstituted drug may be administered over a 30-minute period by direct infusion or through a Y‑type intravenous infusion set. If this method of administration is used, it is advisable to temporarily discontinue the administration of any other solutions during the infusion of TIMENTIN.</p><p>When TIMENTIN is given in combination with another antimicrobial, such as an aminoglycoside, each drug should be given separately in accordance with the recommended dosage and routes of administration for each drug <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">GALAXY<span class="Sup">®</span> Container (PL 2040 Plastic):</span> Prior to administration, TIMENTIN should be inspected visually for particulate matter.

These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with TIMENTIN, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue TIMENTIN and institute appropriate therapy.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including TIMENTIN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Convulsions</h3><p class="First">Patients may experience convulsions when the dose of TIMENTIN exceeds the recommended dose, especially in the presence of impaired renal function <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><h3>Risk of Bleeding</h3><p class="First">Some patients receiving β-lactam antibacterials have experienced bleeding associated with abnormalities in coagulation tests. These adverse reactions are more likely to occur in patients with renal impairment. If bleeding manifestations appear, treatment with TIMENTIN should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><h3>Potential for Microbial Overgrowth or Bacterial Resistance</h3><p class="First">The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. If superinfections occur, appropriate measures should be taken.</p><h3>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing TIMENTIN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug‑resistant bacteria.</p><h3>Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">High urine concentrations of ticarcillin may produce false-positive protein reactions (pseudoproteinuria) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.4)]</span>.</p><p>Clavulanic acid may cause a nonspecific binding of IgG and albumin by red cell membranes, leading to a false-positive Coombs test <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Electrolyte Imbalance</h3><p class="First">Hypokalemia has been reported during treatment with TIMENTIN. Serum potassium should be monitored in patients with fluid and electrolyte imbalance and in patients receiving prolonged therapy. The theoretical sodium content is 4.51 mEq (103.6 mg) per gram of TIMENTIN. This should be considered when treating patients requiring restricted salt intake.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% of 867 patients receiving TIMENTIN 3.1 grams in clinical studies included rash, nausea, diarrhea, and phlebitis at the injection site. The most common laboratory abnormalities (≥3%) were elevations in eosinophils, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT).</p><p>Available safety data for pediatric patients treated with TIMENTIN demonstrate a similar adverse event profile to that observed in adult patients.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of TIMENTIN. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These adverse reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to TIMENTIN.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hypersensitivity Reactions:</span> Skin rash, pruritus, urticaria, arthralgia, myalgia, drug fever, chills, chest discomfort, anaphylactic reactions, and bullous reactions (including erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Stevens‑Johnson syndrome).</p><p><span class="Bold">Central Nervous System:</span> Headache, giddiness, neuromuscular hyperirritability, or convulsive seizures.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Disturbances:</span> Disturbances of taste and smell, stomatitis, flatulence, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, epigastric pain, and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hemic and Lymphatic Systems:</span> Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, eosinophilia, reduction of hemoglobin or hematocrit, and prolongation of prothrombin time and bleeding time.</p><p><span class="Bold">Abnormalities of Hepatic Function Tests:</span> Elevation of AST, ALT, serum alkaline phosphatase, serum LDH, and serum bilirubin. There have been reports of transient hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice, as with some other penicillins and some cephalosporins.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal and Urinary Effects:</span> Hemorrhagic cystitis, elevation of serum creatinine and/or BUN, hypernatremia, reduction in serum potassium, and uric acid.</p><p><span class="Bold">Local Reactions:</span> Pain, burning, swelling, and induration at the injection site and thrombophlebitis with intravenous administration.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Aminoglycosides</h3><p class="First">The mixing of TIMENTIN with an aminoglycoside in solutions for parenteral administration can result in substantial inactivation of the aminoglycoside.</p><h3>Probenecid</h3><p class="First">Probenecid interferes with the renal tubular secretion of ticarcillin, thereby increasing serum concentrations and prolonging serum half‑life of ticarcillin. Probenecid does not affect the serum levels of clavulanic acid.</p><h3>Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First">Ticarcillin disodium/clavulanate potassium may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives.</p><h3>Effects on Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">High urine concentrations of ticarcillin may produce false‑positive protein reactions (pseudoproteinuria) with certain methods. The bromphenol blue reagent strip test has been reported to be a reliable method for testing protein reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</p><p>Clavulanic acid in TIMENTIN may cause a nonspecific binding of IgG and albumin by red cell membranes, leading to a false‑positive Coombs test. A positive Coombs test should be interpreted with caution during treatment with TIMENTIN <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category B.</p><p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats given doses up to 1,050 mg/kg/day (approximately half of the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to TIMENTIN. There are, however, no adequate and well‑controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether ticarcillin or clavulanic acid is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when TIMENTIN is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of TIMENTIN have been established in the age group of 3 months to 16 years. Use of TIMENTIN in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well‑controlled studies of TIMENTIN in adults with additional efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic data from both comparative and non‑comparative studies in pediatric patients. There are insufficient data to support the use of TIMENTIN in pediatric patients under 3 months of age.</p><p>If meningitis is suspected or documented, an alternative agent with demonstrated clinical efficacy in this setting should be used.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">An analysis of clinical studies of TIMENTIN was conducted to determine whether subjects aged 65 and older respond differently from younger subjects. Of the 1,078 subjects treated with at least one dose of TIMENTIN, 67.5% were &lt;65 years old, and 32.5% were ≥65 years old. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but a greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].</span></p><p>TIMENTIN contains 103.6 mg (4.51 mEq) of sodium per gram of TIMENTIN. At the usual recommended doses, patients would receive between 1,285 and 1,927 mg/day (56 and 84 mEq) of sodium. The geriatric population may respond with a blunted natriuresis to salt loading. This may be clinically important with regard to such diseases as congestive heart failure.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Ticarcillin is predominantly excreted by the kidney <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Dosage adjustments should be made for patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In case of overdosage, discontinue TIMENTIN, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures as required. Ticarcillin and clavulanic acid may be removed from circulation by hemodialysis.</p><h2>Timentin Injection Description</h2><p class="First">TIMENTIN <span class="Bold">(</span>ticarcillin disodium and clavulanate potassium) for Injection, 3.1‑gram glass vial, 31‑gram Pharmacy Bulk Package, and TIMENTIN (ticarcillin disodium and clavulanate potassium) Injection in the GALAXY Container (PL 2040 Plastic) are a combination of ticarcillin disodium and the β‑lactamase inhibitor clavulanate potassium (the potassium salt of clavulanic acid) for intravenous administration. Ticarcillin is derived from the basic penicillin nucleus, 6‑amino‑penicillanic acid.</p><p>Chemically, ticarcillin disodium is <span class="Italics">N</span>-(2-Carboxy-3,3-dimethyl-7-oxo-4-thia-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-6-yl)-3-thiophenemalonamic acid disodium salt and may be represented as:</p><p>Clavulanic acid is produced by the fermentation of <span class="Italics">Streptomyces clavuligerus</span>. It is a β‑lactam structurally related to the penicillins and possesses the ability to inactivate a wide variety of β‑lactamases by blocking the active sites of these enzymes.
