Petioles are as long as or longer than the leaf blade.Miller 1768, Partap 2012 The vine climbs by axillary tendrils, attaining 10 m in length.Miller 1768 Stems are green, slender, subcylindrical or angular, ribbed, and glabrous or puberulous. The fruit is trigonal and slightly sulcate and grows from 20 to 45 cm long, with numerous seeds that are 10 to 13 mm long, elliptical, black, and smooth. The pericarp, dehiscent by apical pores, is crustose, and the mesocarp forms a network of fibers.Miller 1768, Partap 2012 When the fruit matures and dries, the remaining mesocarp is dried, tangled vascular bundles that form a durable, dense, and stiff but compressible fibrous matrix.Marr 2005</p><h2>History</h2><p>L. aegyptiaca is native to South and Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, where it is known locally as "mu phuong" or "Vietnamese luffa."USDA 2000 It is common in Egypt, where it is cultivated in different areas. The German anatomist and botanist Johann Vesling first described the plant in European botanical literature in 1638 as the "Egyptian cucumber,"Vesling 1638 and because the Europeans first learned of if its cultivation in Egypt, the species was named <i>aegyptiaca</i>.USDA 2000 In the folk medicine of Sainai, Egypt, the seeds were reputed to have value in controlling diabetes mellitus.Vesling 1638 The young fruit of the plant resembles a cucumber and is consumed as a vegetable; the skin is usually peeled off and the remainder is either fried or curried, or eaten as a raw salad.Thayyil 2011, USDA 2000 Unlike the young fruit, the fully ripened fruit is strongly fibrous and inedible and is used to make scrubbing sponges.USDA 2000 L. aegyptiaca is also called "smooth luffa" to distinguish it from the ridged luffa (L. acutangula [L.] Roxb.), which is used for the same purposes.USDA 2000 The seeds and sponge of the old fruits are used in traditional Chinese medicine as an anthelmintic, stomachic, and antipyretic.El-Fiky 1996, Marr 2005 The fruit has been used in leprosy, spleen diseases, piles, fever, hematuria, and bronchitis.Nirmal 2009 The plant is occasionally grown as an ornamental for its large, beautiful yellow flowers.</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>L. aegyptiaca fruit has more than 100 components, including mucilage, reducing sugars, resins, alkaloids, organic acids, tannins, saponins, and proteins.Karaye 2013 It also contains monounsatuarated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, fiber, flavonoids, niacin, and ascorbic acid, which help to reduce hypercholesterolemia.Karaye 2012 Hydrocarbons identified from the fruit of L. aegyptiaca are n-tricosane, n-tetracosane, n-hexacosane, n-heptacosane, and noctacosane; identified fatty acids are nanodecane-6-ol, eicosane-6-ol, dieicosane-6-ol, and tetraeicosane-6-ol.Nirmal 2009 Antioxidant compounds, such as <i>p</i>-coumaric acid, 1-<i>O</i>-feruloyl-beta-D-glucose, 1-<i>O</i>-p-coumaroyl-beta-D-glucose, 1-<i>O</i>-caffeoyl- beta-D-glucose, 1-<i>O</i>-(4-hydroxybenzoyl) glucose, diosmetin-7-<i>O</i>-beta-Dglucuronide methyl ester, apigenin-7-<i>O</i>-beta-D-glucuronide methyl ester, and luteolin-7-<i>O</i>-beta-D-glucuronide methyl ester, have been identified in luffa.Du 2006</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>Limited clinical data are available. One report shows that water extracts from fresh sponge gourds exhibited more than 80% inhibition of nitric oxide generation stimulated by lipopolysaccharide.Thayyil 2011 In vitro, luffacylin, a ribosome-inactivating peptide found in luffa, inhibited Mycosphaerella arachidicola and Fusarium oxysporum, demonstrating antifungal properties.Parkash 2002 Flavonoids in the plant have been shown to have antioxidant properties.Du 2006 The edible parts of luffa have been taken orally for the treatment and prevention of colds. It is also used for nasal swelling and sinus problems and as an ingredient in over-the-counter nasal products. Luffa has been used for dyslipidemic, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, antihypertensive, and diuretic purposes.Thayyil 2011</p><h3>Anti-inflammatory activity</h3><p>Intraperitoneal administration of a water decoction of L. cylindrica inhibited carrageenan-induced plantar edema in rats, demonstrating anti-inflammatory activity.Muthumani 2010</p><p>Limited clinical data are available for the use of luffa in humans.</p><h3>Diabetes</h3><p>A study investigated the effect of oral administration of ethanolic extracts of L. aegyptiaca seeds on blood glucose levels in healthy rats and rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes. L. aegyptiaca reduced glucose levels with potency similar to that of the biguanide metformin.El-Fiky 1996</p><p>Limited clinical data are available for the use of luffa in humans.</p><h3>Hypolipidemic effect</h3><p>In 1 study, New Zealand white rabbits with induced hypercholesterolemia were fed a normal diet, supplemented with 1% cholesterol and 10% ground nut oil for 8 weeks. One group was given a methanolic extract of L. aegyptiaca fruits at a dosage of 300 mg/kg/day. The methanolic extract reduced serum total cholesterol by 29%, triglycerides by 52%, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 22%; it also increased the serum high-density lipoprotein by 38%.Thayyil 2011 Luffa has hypolipidemic activity and cholesterol-reducing activity in animal models.Thayyil 2011</p><p>Limited clinical data are available for the use of luffa in humans.</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>The appropriate dosage regimen of luffa depends on factors such as age, health, and other conditions. At this time, there is not enough information to determine an appropriate range of doses for luffa.</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>Luffa is safe for most people when used directly on the skin as a sponge. There is no evidence pertaining to interactions with oral use.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Luffa is safe when used as food. However, information regarding adverse reactions with the use of luffa in higher dosages is lacking.</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>There is no definite information regarding toxicity. In a toxicological study in rats, <i>L. aegyptiaca</i> fruit extracts were administered in doses ranging from 100 to 2,000 mg without mortality.Thayyil 2011</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
