It works partly by keeping skin pores clear.</p><p>One of the tretinoin creams is used to treat fine wrinkles, dark spots, or rough skin on the face caused by the damaging rays of the sun. It works by lightening the skin, replacing older skin with newer skin, and slowing down the way the body removes skin cells that may have been harmed by the sun. Tretinoin works best when used within a skin care program that includes protecting the treated skin from the sun. However, it does not completely or permanently erase these skin problems or greatly improve more obvious changes in the skin, such as deep wrinkles caused by the sun or the natural aging process.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Atralin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of tretinoin in children younger than 9 years of age.

In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.

Also, your acne may seem to get worse before it gets better. It may take longer than 12 weeks before you notice full improvement of your acne, even if you use the medicine every day. Check with your doctor if skin irritation becomes severe or if your acne does not improve within 8 to 12 weeks.</p><p>You should avoid washing the skin treated with tretinoin for at least 1 hour after applying it.</p><p>Avoid using any topical medicine on the same area within 1 hour before or after using tretinoin. Otherwise, tretinoin may not work properly or skin irritation might occur.</p><p>Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, it is especially important to avoid using the following skin products on the same area as tretinoin:</p><ul>
<li>Any other topical acne product or skin product containing a peeling agent (eg, benzoyl peroxide, resorcinol, salicylic acid, or sulfur).</li>
<li>Hair products that are irritating, such as permanents or hair removal products.</li>
<li>Skin products that cause sensitivity to the sun, including those containing spices or limes.</li>
<li>Skin products containing a large amount of alcohol (eg, astringents, shaving creams, or after-shave lotions).</li>
<li>Skin products that are too drying or abrasive, such as some cosmetics, soaps, or skin cleansers.</li>
</ul><p>Using these products along with tretinoin may cause mild to severe irritation of the skin. Although skin irritation can occur, some doctors sometimes allow benzoyl peroxide to be used with tretinoin to treat acne. Usually tretinoin is applied at night so that it does not cause a problem with any other topical products that you might use during the day. Check with your doctor before using topical medicines with tretinoin.</p><p>During the first 6 months of use, avoid overexposing the treated areas to sunlight, wind, or cold weather. The skin will be more prone to sunburn, dryness, or irritation, especially during the first 2 or 3 weeks. However, you should not stop using this medicine unless the skin irritation becomes too severe. Do not use a sunlamp.</p><p>To help tretinoin work properly, regularly use sunscreen or sunblocking lotions with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15. Also, wear protective clothing and hats, and apply creams, lotions, or moisturizers often.</p><p>Check with your doctor at any time your skin becomes too dry and irritated. Your doctor can help you choose the right skin products for you to reduce skin dryness and irritation and may include the following:</p><ul>
<li>For patients using tretinoin for the treatment of acne:
<ul>
<li>Regular use of water-based creams or lotions helps to reduce skin irritation or dryness that may be caused by the use of tretinoin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For patients using tretinoin for the treatment of fine wrinkling, dark spots, and rough skin caused by the sun:
<ul>
<li>This medicine should be used as part of an ongoing program to avoid further damage to your skin from the sun. This program includes staying out of the sun when possible or wearing proper clothing or hats to protect your skin from sunlight.</li>
<li>Regular use of oil-based creams or lotions helps to reduce skin irritation or dryness caused by the use of tretinoin.</li>
