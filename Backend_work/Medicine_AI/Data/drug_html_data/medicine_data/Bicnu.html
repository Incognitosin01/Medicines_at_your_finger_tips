<html><head></head><body><h1>Bicnu (Intravenous)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> carmustine (kar-MUS-teen) (Intravenous route)</p><p>Carmustine causes suppression of marrow function (including thrombocytopenia and leukopenia), which may contribute to bleeding and overwhelming infections. Monitor blood counts, adjust dosage based on nadir, and do not administer a repeat course until blood counts recover. Carmustine causes dose-related pulmonary toxicity; patients receiving greater than 1400 mg/m(2) cumulative dose are at significantly higher risk. Delayed pulmonary toxicity can occur years after treatment and may result in death, particularly in patients treated in childhood .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

It may also be used to treat other kinds of cancer, as determined by your doctor.</p><p>Carmustine belongs to the group of alkylating agents. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by carmustine, other effects may occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects (eg, hair loss), may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur for months or years after the medicine is used.</p><p>Before you begin treatment with carmustine, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits this medicine will do as well as the risks.</p><p>This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Bicnu</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Bicnu</h2><p>Medicines used to treat cancer are very strong and can have many side effects.

It is important for you to work closely with your doctor during your treatment.</p><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital. This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins.</p><p>This medicine is usually given every 6 weeks. This maybe given as a single dose or divided into daily injections on 2 consecutive days.</p><p>Carmustine is sometimes given together with certain other medicines. If you are using a combination of medicines, it is important that you receive each one at the proper time. If you are taking some of these medicines by mouth, ask your doctor to help you plan a way to take them at the right times.</p><p>This medicine often causes nausea and vomiting, which usually last no longer than 4 to 6 hours. <i>It is very important that you continue to receive the medicine</i>, even if you begin to feel ill. Ask your doctor for ways to lessen these effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using Bicnu</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby.

This is more likely if you receive high doses of this medicine or use it for a long time.</p><p>While you are being treated with carmustine injection, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Carmustine may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well for you or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.</p><p>Carmustine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>If carmustine accidentally seeps out of the vein into which it is injected, it may damage some tissues and cause scarring. Tell the doctor or nurse right away if you notice redness, pain, or swelling at the injection site.</p><p>This medicine may increase risk of lung problems while smoking.</p><p>If you plan to have children, talk with your doctor before using this medicine. Some men using this medicine have become infertile (unable to have children).</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor.
