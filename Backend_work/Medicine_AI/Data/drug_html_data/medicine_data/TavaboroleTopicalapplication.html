Tavaborole works by killing the fungus or yeast, or preventing its growth.</p><p>Tavaborole is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using tavaborole</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For tavaborole, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to tavaborole or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of tavaborole topical solution in children younger than 6 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of tavaborole topical solution in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of tavaborole than younger adults.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of tavaborole</h2><p><i>Use tavaborole only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.</p><p>Tavaborole should come with a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Tavaborole is for use <i>on the toenails and surrounding skin only</i>. It is not for use in the eyes, mouth, or vagina.</p><p>To use:</p><ul>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using tavaborole.</li>
<li>Apply to the affected toenail(s) by using the dropper tip to gently spread to the entire toenail and surrounding skin. Also, apply the medicine under the entire tip of the toenail.</li>
<li>Your toenails must be clean and dry when you put the medicine. Wipe away any excess solution from the surrounding skin. Let the medicine dry completely after you apply it.</li>
</ul><p>To help clear up your infection completely, it is very important that you <i>keep using tavaborole for the full time of treatment</i>, even if your symptoms begin to clear up after a few days. Since fungus or yeast infections may be very slow to clear up, you may have to continue using tavaborole every day for several weeks or more. If you stop using tavaborole too soon, your symptoms may return. Do not miss any doses.</p><p>Ask your doctor before you use nail polish or other nail products while you are being treated with tavaborole.</p><p>Tavaborole is flammable. Do not use it near heat, an open flame, or while smoking.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of tavaborole will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of tavaborole. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.
