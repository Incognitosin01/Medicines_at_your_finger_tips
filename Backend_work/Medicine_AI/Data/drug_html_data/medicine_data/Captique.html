Captique adds volume to the skin, smoothing lines and wrinkles and the treatment results are immediate. Over time, the gel will gradually break down and be naturally absorbed by your body.</p><p>After the initial treatment, an additional treatment of Captique gel may be necessary to achieve the desired level of correction. The need for an additional treatment will vary from patient to patient.</p><h2>More about Captique (dermal filler topical)</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
