</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Clofarabine Injection</h2><p class="First">Clofarabine Injection is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 to 21 years old with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia after at least two prior regimens. This indication is based upon response rate. There are no trials verifying an improvement in disease-related symptoms or increased survival with Clofarabine Injection.</p><h2>Clofarabine Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosage</h3><p class="First">Administer the recommended pediatric dose of 52 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> as an intravenous infusion over 2 hours daily for 5 consecutive days.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Repeat treatment cycles following recovery or return to baseline organ function, approximately every 2 to 6 weeks. Base dosage on the patient's body surface area (BSA), calculated using the actual height and weight before the start of each cycle. To prevent drug incompatibilities, do not administer other medications through the same intravenous line. Administer subsequent cycles no sooner than 14 days from the starting day of the previous cycle and provided the patient's ANC is ≥0.75 × 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L.</li>
<li>Provide supportive care, such as intravenous fluids, antihyperuricemic treatment, and alkalinize urine throughout the 5 days of Clofarabine Injection administration to reduce the effects of tumor lysis and other adverse reactions.</li>
<li>Discontinue Clofarabine Injection if hypotension develops during the 5 days of administration.</li>
<li>Monitor renal and hepatic function during the 5 days of Clofarabine Injection administration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8)]</span>.</li>
<li>Monitor patients taking medications known to affect blood pressure. Monitor cardiac function during administration of Clofarabine Injection.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommended Dosage Reduction for Renal Impairment</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Reduce the dose by 50% in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCL) between 30 and 60 mL/min. There is insufficient information to make a dosage recommendation in patients with CrCL less than 30 mL/min <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span>.</li>
</ul><h3>Potential Concomitant Medications and Medications to Avoid</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Consider prophylactic antiemetic medications as Clofarabine Injection is moderately emetogenic.</li>
<li>Consider the use of prophylactic steroids to mitigate Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) or capillary leak syndrome (e.g., hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and pulmonary edema).</li>
<li>Minimize exposure to drugs with known renal toxicity during the 5 days of Clofarabine Injection administration since the risk of renal toxicity may be increased.</li>
<li>Avoid concomitant use of medications known to induce hepatic toxicity.</li>
</ul><h3>Dose Modifications and Reinitiation of Therapy after Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hematologic Toxicity</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>If a patient experiences a Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC &lt;0.5 × 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L) lasting ≥4 weeks, reduce dose by 25% for the next cycle.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Non-hematologic Toxicity</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Withhold Clofarabine Injection if a patient develops a clinically significant infection, until the infection is controlled, then restart at the full dose.</li>
<li>Withhold Clofarabine Injection for a Grade 3 non-infectious non-hematologic toxicity (excluding transient elevations in serum transaminases and/or serum bilirubin and/or nausea/vomiting controlled by antiemetic therapy). Re-institute Clofarabine Injection administration at a 25% dose reduction when resolution or return to baseline.</li>
<li>Discontinue Clofarabine Injection administration for a Grade 4 non-infectious non-hematologic toxicity.</li>
<li>Discontinue Clofarabine Injection administration if a patient shows early signs or symptoms of SIRS or capillary leak syndrome (e.g., hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and pulmonary edema) occur and provide appropriate supportive measures.</li>
<li>Discontinue Clofarabine Injection administration if Grade 3 or higher increases in creatinine or bilirubin are noted. Re-institute Clofarabine Injection with a 25% dose reduction, when the patient is stable and organ function has returned to baseline. If hyperuricemia is anticipated (tumor lysis), initiate measures to control uric acid.</li>
</ul><h3>Reconstitution/Preparation</h3><p class="First">Filter Clofarabine Injection through a sterile 0.2 micron syringe filter and then dilute with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP prior to intravenous infusion to a final concentration between 0.15 mg per mL and 0.4 mg per mL. Use within 24 hours of preparation. Store diluted Clofarabine Injection at room temperature (15° to 30ºC).</p><p>Discard unused portion in vial.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Injection: 20 mg per 20 mL (1 mg per mL) clear solution in single-dose vial</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myelosuppression</h3><p class="First">Clofarabine causes myelosuppression which may be severe and prolonged. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 55% and non-febrile neutropenia in an additional 10% of pediatric patients in clinical trials. At initiation of treatment, most patients in the clinical studies had hematological impairment as a manifestation of leukemia. Myelosuppression is usually reversible with interruption of clofarabine treatment and appears to be dose-dependent. Monitor complete blood counts <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Hemorrhage</h3><p class="First">Serious and fatal hemorrhage, including cerebral, gastrointestinal and pulmonary hemorrhage, has occurred. The majority of the cases were associated with thrombocytopenia. Monitor platelets and coagulation parameters and treat accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Infections</h3><p class="First">Clofarabine increases the risk of infection, including severe and fatal sepsis, and opportunistic infections. At baseline, 48% of the pediatric patients had one or more concurrent infections. A total of 83% of patients experienced at least one infection after clofarabine treatment, including fungal, viral and bacterial infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection, discontinue clofarabine, and treat promptly.</p><h3>Tumor Lysis Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Administration of clofarabine may result in tumor lysis syndrome associated with the break-down metabolic products from peripheral leukemia cell death. Monitor patients undergoing treatment for signs and symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome and initiate preventive measures including adequate intravenous fluids and measures to control uric acid.</p><h3>Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and Capillary Leak Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Clofarabine may cause a cytokine release syndrome (e.g., tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, pulmonary edema) that may progress to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with capillary leak syndrome and organ impairment which may be fatal. Monitor patients frequently for these conditions. In clinical trials, SIRS was reported in two patients (2%); capillary leak syndrome was reported in four patients (4%). Symptoms included rapid onset of respiratory distress, hypotension, pleural and pericardial effusion, and multiorgan failure. Close monitoring for this syndrome and early intervention may reduce the risk. Immediately discontinue clofarabine and provide appropriate supportive measures. The use of prophylactic steroids (e.g., 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> hydrocortisone on Days 1 through 3) may be of benefit in preventing signs or symptoms of SIRS or capillary leak syndrome. Consider use of diuretics and/or albumin. After the patient is stabilized and organ function has returned to baseline, retreatment with clofarabine can be considered with a 25% dose reduction.</p><h3>Venous Occlusive Disease of the Liver</h3><p class="First">Patients who have previously received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are at higher risk for veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver following treatment with clofarabine (40 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) when used in combination with etoposide (100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) and cyclophosphamide (440 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). Severe hepatotoxic events have been reported in a combination study of clofarabine in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia. Two cases (2%) of VOD in the monotherapy studies were considered related to study drug. Monitor for and discontinue clofarabine if VOD is suspected.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Severe and fatal hepatotoxicity, including hepatitis and hepatic failure, has occurred with the use of clofarabine. In clinical studies, Grade 3-4 liver enzyme elevations were observed in pediatric patients during treatment with clofarabine at the following rates: elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 36% of patients; elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occurred in 44% of patients. AST and ALT elevations typically occurred within 10 days of clofarabine administration and returned to Grade 2 or less within 15 days. Grade 3 or 4 elevated bilirubin occurred in 13% of patients, with 2 events reported as Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia (2%), one of which resulted in treatment discontinuation and one patient had multiorgan failure and died. Eight patients (7%) had Grade 3 or 4 elevations in serum bilirubin at the last time point measured; these patients died due to sepsis and/or multiorgan failure. Monitor hepatic function, and for signs and symptoms of hepatitis and hepatic failure. Discontinue clofarabine immediately for Grade 3 or greater liver enzyme and/or bilirubin elevations <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Clofarabine may cause acute renal failure. In clofarabine treated patients in clinical studies, Grade 3 or 4 elevated creatinine occurred in 8% of patients and acute renal failure was reported as Grade 3 in three patients (3%) and Grade 4 in two patients (2%). Patients with infection, sepsis, or tumor lysis syndrome may be at increased risk of renal toxicity when treated with clofarabine. Hematuria occurred in 13% of clofarabine treated patients overall. Monitor patients for renal toxicity and interrupt or discontinue clofarabine as necessary <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Enterocolitis</h3><p class="First">Fatal and serious cases of enterocolitis, including neutropenic colitis, cecitis, and <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> colitis, have occurred during treatment with clofarabine. This has occurred more frequently within 30 days of treatment, and in the setting of combination chemotherapy. Enterocolitis may lead to necrosis, perforation, hemorrhage or sepsis complications. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis and treat promptly.</p><h3>Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and fatal cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported. Discontinue clofarabine for exfoliative or bullous rash, or if SJS or TEN is suspected <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on findings from animal reproductive studies and the drug's mechanism of action, clofarabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Intravenous doses of clofarabine in rats and rabbits administered during organogenesis at doses that were below the maximum recommended human dose of 52 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> based on body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) caused an increase in resorptions, malformations, and variations. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with clofarabine and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with clofarabine and for at least 3 months after the last dose <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>In animal reproduction studies, intravenous administration of clofarabine to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 0.2- to 1-times the maximum recommended human dose of 52 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> based on body surface area (BSA) resulted in embryo-fetal mortality, alterations to growth, and structural abnormalities <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. There are no available data on clofarabine use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Clofarabine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks, including those to the fetus.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First">Animal data</p><p>Intravenous administration of clofarabine to pregnant rats during organogenesis (gestation days [GD] 7-17) at doses of 1, 3 or 9 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 6, 18, 54 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day) resulted in maternal toxicities at the 9 mg/kg dose, as indicated by reduced body weights and food consumption. Developmental toxicity (i.e., reduced fetal body weights and increased postimplantation loss) and increased incidences of external, soft tissue, and skeletal malformations and variations (including retarded ossification) were observed at 9 mg/kg/day (54 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>; approximately equivalent to the recommended human dose based on BSA). Altered ossification patterns (extra metacarpal or metatarsal ossification) were observed in single fetuses at lower doses of clofarabine (1 and 3 mg/kg/day; 0.1- and 0.3-times the recommended human dose based on BSA).</p><p>When clofarabine was administered intravenously to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis (GD 6-18) at doses of 0.1, 0.3, or 1 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 1.2, 3.6, 12 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day), developmental toxicity (i.e., reduced fetal body weights and increased postimplantation loss) and increased incidences of external, soft tissue, and skeletal malformations and variations (including retarded ossification) were observed at the 1 mg/kg/day dose (12 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>; 0.2-times the recommended human dose based on BSA). Alterations in ossification patterns (increase in the average numbers of ossified thoracic vertebrae and rib pairs, and reduction in the average number of forepaw metacarpals) and abdominal wall defect were observed at 0.3 mg/kg/day (3.6 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>; 0.1-times the recommended human dose based on BSA).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of clofarabine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production.

There is insufficient information to make a dosage recommendation in patients with CrCL less than 30 mL/min or in patients on dialysis.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of clofarabine in patients with renal impairment and normal renal function were obtained from a population pharmacokinetic analysis of three pediatric and two adult studies. In patients with CrCL 60 to less than 90 mL/min (N=47) and CrCL 30 to less than 60 mL/min (N=30), the average AUC of clofarabine increased by 60% and 140%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (N=66) renal function (CrCL greater than 90 mL/min).</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There were no known overdoses of clofarabine. The highest daily dose administered to a human to date (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) has been 70 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day × 5 days (2 pediatric ALL patients). The toxicities included in these 2 patients included Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia, Grade 2 and 3 vomiting, and Grade 3 maculopapular rash.</p><p>In a Phase 1 study of adults with refractory and/or relapsed hematologic malignancies, the recommended pediatric dose of 52 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day was not tolerated.</p><h2>Clofarabine Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Clofarabine Injection contains clofarabine, a purine nucleoside metabolic inhibitor. The chemical name of clofarabine is 2-chloro-9-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-D-arabinofuranosyl)-9H-purin-6-amine. Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">10</span>H<span class="Sub">11</span>ClFN<span class="Sub">5</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span> with a molecular weight of 303.68 Daltons.</p><p>The molecular structure of clofarabine is:</p><p>Clofarabine Injection (1 mg per mL) is supplied in a 20 mL single-dose vial. The 20 mL vial contains 20 mg clofarabine formulated in 20 mL unbuffered normal saline (comprised of Water for Injection, USP and Sodium Chloride, USP). The pH range of the solution is 4.5 to 7.5. The solution is sterile, clear and practically colorless, and is preservative-free.</p><h2>Clofarabine Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Clofarabine is sequentially metabolized intracellularly to the 5′-monophosphate metabolite by deoxycytidine kinase and mono- and di-phospho-kinases to the active 5′-triphosphate metabolite. Clofarabine has affinity for the activating phosphorylating enzyme, deoxycytidine kinase, equal to or greater than that of the natural substrate, deoxycytidine. Clofarabine inhibits DNA synthesis by decreasing cellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate pools through an inhibitory action on ribonucleotide reductase, and by terminating DNA chain elongation and inhibiting repair through incorporation into the DNA chain by competitive inhibition of DNA polymerases. The affinity of clofarabine triphosphate for these enzymes is similar to or greater than that of deoxyadenosine triphosphate. In preclinical models, clofarabine has demonstrated the ability to inhibit DNA repair by incorporation into the DNA chain during the repair process. Clofarabine 5′-triphosphate also disrupts the integrity of mitochondrial membrane, leading to the release of the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor, leading to programmed cell death.</p><p>Clofarabine is cytotoxic to rapidly proliferating and quiescent cancer cell types <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The population pharmacokinetics of clofarabine were studied in 40 pediatric patients aged 2 to 19 years (21 males/19 females) with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). At the given 52 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> dose, similar concentrations were obtained over a wide range of body surface areas (BSAs). Clofarabine was 47% bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to albumin. Based on non-compartmental analysis, systemic clearance and volume of distribution at steady-state were 28.8 L/h/m<span class="Sup">2</span> and 172 L/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively. The terminal half-life was 5.2 hours. No apparent difference in pharmacokinetics was observed between patients with ALL and AML or between males and females.</p><p>No relationship between clofarabine or clofarabine triphosphate exposure and toxicity or response was found in this population.</p><p>Based on 24-hour urine collections in the pediatric studies, 49% to 60% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies using isolated human hepatocytes indicate very limited metabolism (0.2%). The pathways of non-hepatic elimination remain unknown.</p><p>Clofarabine has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug-Drug Interactions</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies suggested that clofarabine undergoes limited metabolism and does not inhibit or induce major CYP enzymes. CYP inhibitors and inducers are unlikely to affect the metabolism of clofarabine. Clofarabine is unlikely to affect the metabolism of CYP substrates. However, no <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> drug interaction studies have been conducted.</p><p>An <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> transporter study suggested that clofarabine is a substrate of human transporters OAT1, OAT3, and OCT1. A preclinical study using perfused rat kidney demonstrated that the renal excretion of clofarabine was decreased by cimetidine, an inhibitor of the hOCT2. Although the clinical implications of this finding have not been determined, signs of clofarabine toxicity should be monitored when administered with other hOAT1, hOAT3, hOCT1 and hOCT2 substrates or inhibitors.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Clofarabine has not been tested for carcinogenic potential.</p><p>Clofarabine was clastogenic in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mammalian cell chromosome aberration assay (CHO cells) and in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> rat micronucleus assay. Clofarabine was not mutagenic in the bacterial mutation assay (Ames test).</p><p>Studies in mice, rats, and dogs have demonstrated dose-related adverse effects on male reproductive organs. Seminiferous tubule and testicular degeneration and atrophy were reported in male mice receiving intraperitoneal doses of 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.2-times the recommended human dose based on body surface area [BSA]). Rats receiving 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 3-times the recommended human dose based on BSA) in a 6-month intravenous study had testicular findings of bilateral degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium with retained spermatids and atrophy of interstitial cells. In a 6-month intravenous dog study, cell degeneration of the epididymis and degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium in the testes were observed at 0.375 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.1-times the recommended human dose on a BSA basis). Ovarian atrophy or degeneration and uterine mucosal apoptosis were observed in female mice at 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 4-times the recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), the only dose administered to female mice.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Seventy-eight (78) pediatric patients with ALL were exposed to clofarabine. Seventy (70) of the patients received the recommended pediatric dose of clofarabine 52 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> daily for 5 days as an intravenous infusion.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose Escalation Study in Pediatric Patients with Hematologic Malignancies</span></p><p>The safety and efficacy of clofarabine were evaluated in pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed hematologic malignancies in an open-label, dose-escalation, noncomparative study (NCT00042341, A Phase II, Open Label Study of Clofarabine in Pediatric Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia). The starting dose of clofarabine was 11.25 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day intravenous infusion daily × 5 and escalated to 70 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day intravenous infusion daily × 5. This dosing schedule was repeated every 2 to 6 weeks depending on toxicity and response. Nine of 17 ALL patients were treated with clofarabine 52 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> daily for 5 days. In the 17 ALL patients there were 2 complete remissions (12%) and 2 partial remissions (12%) at varying doses. Dose-limiting toxicities in this study were reversible hyperbilirubinemia and elevated transaminase levels and skin rash, experienced at 70 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. As a result of this study, the recommended dose for subsequent study in pediatric patients was determined to be 52 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day for 5 days.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Single-Arm Study in Pediatric ALL</span></p><p>Clofarabine was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm study of 61 pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. Patients received a dose of 52 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> intravenous infusion over 2 hours for 5 consecutive days repeated every 2 to 6 weeks for up to 12 cycles. There was no dose escalation in this study.</p><p>All patients had disease that had relapsed after and/or was refractory to two or more prior therapies. Most patients, 38/61 (62%), had received &gt;2 prior regimens and 18/61 (30%) of the patients had undergone at least 1 prior transplant. The median age of the treated patients was 12 years, 61% were male, 39% were female, 44% were Caucasian, 38% were Hispanic, 12% were African-American, 2% were Asian and 5% were Other race.</p><p>The overall remission (OR) rate (Complete Remission [CR] + CR in the absence of total platelet recovery [CRp]) was evaluated. CR was defined as no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease, an M1 bone marrow (≤5% blasts), and recovery of peripheral counts [platelets ≥100 × 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1 × 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L]. CRp was defined as meeting all criteria for CR except for recovery of platelet counts to ≥100 × 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L. Partial Response (PR) was also determined, defined as complete disappearance of circulating blasts, an M2 bone marrow (≥5% and ≤25% blasts), and appearance of normal progenitor cells or an M1 marrow that did not qualify for CR or CRp. Duration of remission was also evaluated. Transplantation rate was not a study endpoint.</p><p>Response rates for these studies were determined by an unblinded Independent Response Review Panel (IRRP).</p><p>Table 3 summarizes results for the pediatric ALL study. Responses were seen in both pre-B and T-cell immunophenotypes of ALL. The median cumulative dose was 530 mg (range 29-2,815 mg) in 1 (41%), 2 (44%) or 3 or more (15%) cycles. The median number of cycles was 2 (range 1-12). The median time between cycles was 28 days with a range of 12 to 55 days.</p><p class="First Footnote">CR = Complete response</p><p class="First Footnote">CRp = Complete response without platelet recovery</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">1</span> Does not include 4 patients who were transplanted (duration of response, including response after transplant, in these 4 patients was 28.6 to 107.7 weeks).</p><p>Six (9.8%) patients achieved a PR; the clinical relevance of a PR in this setting is unknown.</p><p>Of 35 patients who were refractory to their immediately preceding induction regimen, 6 (17%) achieved a CR or CRp. Of 18 patients who had at least 1 prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), 5 (28%) achieved a CR or CRp.</p><p>Among the 12 patients who achieved at least a CRp, 6 patients achieved the best response after 1 cycle of clofarabine, 5 patients required 2 courses and 1 patient achieved a CR after 3 cycles of therapy.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Clofarabine Injection is a sterile, clear and practically colorless solution, is preservative-free and is free from foreign matter.
