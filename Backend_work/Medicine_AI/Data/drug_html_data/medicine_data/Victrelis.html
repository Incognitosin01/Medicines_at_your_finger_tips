<li>
<p>Use at least 2 effective forms of birth control while either sexual partner is using ribavirin. Keep using 2 forms of birth control for at least 6 months after treatment ends. Tell your doctor right away if a pregnancy occurs while either the mother or the father is using ribavirin.</p>

<br/>
DURATION OF THERAPY:<br/>
In Patients without Cirrhosis Who Are Previously Untreated or Who Previously Failed Interferon and Ribavirin Therapy (HCV-RNA levels should be monitored at treatment weeks [TWs] 8, 12, and 24 to determine duration of therapy and assess for treatment futility):<br/>
Previously untreated patients:<br/>
-HCV-RNA not detected at TWs 8 and 24: Complete 3-drug regimen (boceprevir, peginterferon alfa, ribavirin) at TW 28.<br/>
-HCV-RNA detected at TW 8 and not detected at TW 24: Continue all 3 drugs and finish through TW 36, and then use peginterferon alfa and ribavirin and finish through TW 48.<br/>
-Poorly interferon responsive at TW 4: Consider using 3-drug regimen for 44 weeks (to maximize rates of sustained virologic response [SVR]).<br/>
<br/>
Previous partial responders or relapsers:<br/>
-HCV-RNA not detected at TWs 8 and 24: Complete 3-drug regimen at TW 36.<br/>
-HCV-RNA detected at TW 8 and not detected at TW 24: Continue all 3 drugs and finish through TW 36, and then use peginterferon alfa and ribavirin and finish through TW 48.<br/>
<br/>
Previous null responders:<br/>
-HCV-RNA detected or not detected at TW 8 and not detected at TW 24: Continue all 3 drugs and finish through TW 48.<br/>
<br/>
In Patients with Compensated Cirrhosis:<br/>
-The 3-drug regimen should be used for 44 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
TREATMENT FUTILITY:<br/>
-Therapy discontinuation is recommended in all patients with (a) HCV-RNA levels at least 1000 international units/mL at TW 8, or (b) HCV-RNA levels at least 100 international units/mL at TW 12, or (c) confirmed detectable HCV-RNA levels at TW 24.<br/>
<br/>
COMMENTS:<br/>
-Therapy should be initiated with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for 4 weeks; boceprevir should be added to the regimen after the initial 4 weeks of therapy.<br/>
-Duration of therapy is based on viral response, prior response status, and presence of cirrhosis.<br/>
-Poorly interferon responsive patients using this regimen are less likely to achieve SVR, and have a higher rate of detection of resistance-associated substitutions upon treatment failure, compared to patients with a greater response to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.<br/>
-The risks/benefits of this regimen should be carefully considered before starting therapy in patients with compensated cirrhosis who have platelet count less than 100,000/mm3 and serum albumin less than 3.5 g/dL at baseline.<br/>
<br/>
USE: For the treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection, in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, in patients with compensated liver disease, including cirrhosis, who are previously untreated or who have failed previous interferon and ribavirin therapy, including prior null responders, partial responders, and relapsers</p><p>Take the missed dose as soon as you remember.
