</ul><h2>4. CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Stavudine Capsules are contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to stavudine or to any of the components contained in the formulation.</p><p>Co-administration of Stavudine Capsules with didanosine is contraindicated due to the potential for serious and/or life-threatening events notably lactic acidosis, hepatotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">5.2</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">5.3</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">5.4</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><h2>5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis</h3><p class="First">Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including stavudine and other antiretrovirals.<span class="Bold"> </span> Although relative rates of lactic acidosis have not been assessed in prospective well-controlled trials, longitudinal cohort and retrospective studies suggest that this infrequent event may be more often associated with antiretroviral combinations containing stavudine. Female gender, obesity, and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals who received the combination of stavudine and didanosine with other antiretroviral agents. Coadministration of stavudine and didanosine is contraindicated [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span><span class="Italics"> </span>and <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>].</p><p>Particular caution should be exercised when administering stavudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases of lactic acidosis have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Generalized fatigue, digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss); respiratory symptoms (tachypnea and dyspnea); or neurologic symptoms, including motor weakness [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>]  might be indicative of the development of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis syndrome.</p><p>Treatment with stavudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered for patients with confirmed lactic acidosis.</p><h3>Hepatic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of stavudine have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.</p><p>Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. Coadministration of stavudine and didanosine is  contraindicated; and the combination of stavudine and hydroxyurea should be avoided <span class="Italics"> </span>[<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span><span class="Italics">  and </span><span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Use with Interferon and Ribavirin-Based Regimens</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as stavudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with stavudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients  [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)</span>],  hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with or without ribavirin and stavudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of stavudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh &gt;6) (see the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin).</p><h3>Neurologic Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Motor weakness has been reported rarely in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy including stavudine. Most of these cases occurred in the setting of lactic acidosis. The evolution of motor weakness may mimic the clinical presentation of Guillain-Barré syndrome (including respiratory failure). If motor weakness develops, stavudine should be discontinued. Symptoms may continue or worsen following discontinuation of therapy.</p><p>Peripheral sensory neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving stavudine therapy. Peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe, is dose-related and occurs more frequently in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease, a history of peripheral neuropathy, or in patients receiving other drugs that have been associated with neuropathy [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>Patients should be monitored for the development of peripheral neuropathy. Stavudine-related peripheral neuropathy may resolve if therapy is withdrawn promptly. If peripheral neuropathy develops permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered. In some cases, symptoms may worsen temporarily following discontinuation of therapy.</p><h3>Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis have occurred during therapy when stavudine was part of a combination regimen that included didanosine in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. The combination of stavudine and any other agents that are toxic to the pancreas should be suspended in patients with suspected pancreatitis. Coadministration of stavudine and didanosine is contraindicated [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span>]. Reinstitution of stavudine after a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis should be undertaken with particular caution and close patient monitoring.</p><h3>Lipoatrophy</h3><p class="First">In randomized controlled trials of treatment-naive patients, clinical lipoatrophy developed in a higher proportion of patients treated with stavudine compared to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir). Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans demonstrated overall limb fat loss in stavudine-treated patients compared to limb fat gain or no gain in patients treated with other nucleosides (abacavir, tenofovir, or zidovudine). The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy are cumulative over time with stavudine-containing regimens. In clinical trials, switching from stavudine to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir) resulted in increases in limb fat with modest to no improvements in clinical lipoatrophy.<br/>
<br/>
Patients receiving stavudine should be monitored for symptoms or signs of lipoatrophy and  questioned about body changes related to lipoatrophy. Given the potential risks of using stavudine including lipoatrophy, a benefit-risk assessment for each patient should be made and an alternative antiretroviral should be considered.</p><h3>Immune Reconstitution Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including stavudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium avium</span> infection, cytomegalovirus, <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jiroveci</span> pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.</p><h2>6.

The clinical significance of the interaction with stavudine is unknown; therefore, concomitant use of stavudine with ribavirin should be undertaken with caution. No pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</p><h2>8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Exposure Registry</span><br/>
<br/>
There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to stavudine during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
<br/>
Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals who received the combination of stavudine and didanosine with other antiretroviral agents. It is unclear if pregnancy augments the risk of lactic acidosis/hepatic steatosis syndrome reported in non-pregnant individuals receiving nucleoside analogues [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]. The combination of stavudine and didanosine is contraindicated [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span>].<br/>
<br/>
Prospective pregnancy data from APR are not sufficient to adequately assess the risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse developmental outcomes. Available data from the APR show no increase in overall risk of major birth defects compared with 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP). The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 15 to 20%.<br/>
<br/>
In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of stavudine at clinically relevant exposures. No developmental toxicities were observed in rats and rabbits at systemic exposures 112 (AUC) and 183 (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) times, respectively, the exposures in humans at the recommended human dose (RHD) of stavudine <span class="Italics">(see Data).<br/></span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span><br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Maternal Adverse Reactions<br/></span><br/>
Cases of lactic acidosis syndrome, sometimes fatal have occurred in pregnant individuals using stavudine in combination with didanosine. Stavudine is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis syndrome/hepatic steatosis syndrome [<span class="Italics">see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span></span>].<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Data</span><br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Human Data<br/></span><br/>
Based on prospective reports to the APR of live births following exposure to stavudine-containing regimens during pregnancy (including 811 exposed in the first trimester and 196 exposed in the second/third trimester), the prevalence of birth defects in live births for stavudine was 2.6% (95% CI: 1.6 % to 3.9%) with first trimester exposure and 3.1% (95% CI: 1.1% to 6.5%) with second/third trimester exposure compared to the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP.<br/>
<br/>
Prospective reports from the APR of overall major birth defects in pregnancies exposed to stavudine is compared with a U.S. background major birth defect rate. Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group. Limitations of using an external comparator include differences in methodology and populations, as well as confounding due to the underlying disease.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Animal Data</span> <br/>
<br/>
Stavudine was administered orally to pregnant rats (0, 50, 250, and 1000 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 17) and rabbits (0, 60, 150, 300 and 600 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18). In rats, fetal skeletal variations, including increased unossified or incomplete ossification of sternebra, were observed at the highest dose (1000 mg/kg/day) (approximately 488 times human AUC exposure at the RHD). In rabbits, there were no developmental effects up to the highest dose of 600 mg/kg (approximately 183 times human C<span class="Sub">max</span> exposure at the RHD).<br/>
<br/>
In the pre/post-natal development study, stavudine was administered orally to rats at 0, 50, 250, and 1000 mg/kg/day from gestation day 17 to postnatal day 21. Post-implantation loss and an increase in early neonatal mortality was observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 488 times human AUC exposure at the RHD). No developmental effects were observed at 250 mg/kg/day (approximately 112 times human AUC exposure at the RHD).<br/>
<br/>
Stavudine was transferred to the fetus through the placenta in rats with concentrations in fetal tissues approximately half the concentration detected in maternal plasma.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
<br/>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV.<br/>
<br/>
Based on limited data, stavudine has been detected in human milk. No data are available regarding the effects of stavudine on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the potential for (1) HIV transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants) and (3) adverse reactions in breastfed infants similar to those seen in adults, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving stavudine.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Use of stavudine in pediatric patients from birth through adolescence is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of stavudine in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>].<br/>
<br/>
Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported to occur in pediatric patients in clinical studies were generally consistent with the safety profile of stavudine in adults. These studies include ACTG 240, where 105 pediatric patients ages 3 months to 6 years received stavudine 2 mg/kg/day for a median of 6.4 months; a controlled clinical trial where 185 newborns received stavudine 2 mg/kg/day either alone or in combination with didanosine from birth through 6 weeks of age; and a clinical trial where 8 newborns received stavudine 2 mg/kg/day in combination with didanosine and nelfinavir from birth through 4 weeks of age.<br/>
<br/>
Stavudine pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in 25 HIV-1-infected pediatric patients ranging in age from 5 weeks to 15 years and in weight from 2 to 43 kg after IV or oral administration of single doses and twice-daily regimens and in 30 HIV-1-exposed or -infected newborns ranging in age from birth to 4 weeks after oral administration of twice-daily regimens [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3, Table 9)</span>].</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of stavudine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Greater sensitivity of some older individuals to the effects of stavudine cannot be ruled out.<br/>
<br/>
In a monotherapy Expanded Access Program for patients with advanced HIV-1 infection, peripheral neuropathy or peripheral neuropathic symptoms were observed in 15 of 40 (38%) elderly patients receiving 40 mg twice daily and 8 of 51 (16%) elderly patients receiving 20 mg twice daily. Of the approximately 12,000 patients enrolled in the Expanded Access Program, peripheral neuropathy or peripheral neuropathic symptoms developed in 30% of patients receiving 40 mg twice daily and 25% of patients receiving 20 mg twice daily. Elderly patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.<br/>
<br/>
Stavudine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function. Dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment [<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Data from two studies in adults indicated that the apparent oral clearance of stavudine decreased and the terminal elimination half-life increased as creatinine clearance decreased. Based on these observations, it is recommended that the stavudine dosage be modified in patients with reduced creatinine clearance and in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span><span class="Italics"> </span>and <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span></span>].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Experience with adults treated with 12 to 24 times the recommended daily dosage revealed no acute toxicity. Complications of chronic overdosage include peripheral neuropathy and hepatic toxicity. Stavudine can be removed by hemodialysis; the mean ± SD hemodialysis clearance of stavudine is 120 ± 18 mL/min. Whether stavudine is eliminated by peritoneal dialysis has not been studied.</p><h2>Stavudine Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Stavudine Capsules, USP contain stavudine (d4T), which is a synthetic thymidine nucleoside analogue, active against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The chemical name for stavudine is 2′,3′-didehydro-3′-deoxythymidine. Stavudine has the following structural formula:</p><p>Stavudine USP is a white to off-white crystalline solid with the molecular formula C<span class="Sub">10</span>H<span class="Sub">12</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span> and a molecular weight of 224.2. The solubility of stavudine at 23°C is approximately 83 mg/mL in water and 30 mg/mL in propylene glycol. The n-octanol/water partition coefficient of stavudine at 23°C is 0.144.<br/>
<br/>
Stavudine is available as capsules for oral administration containing either 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, or 40 mg of stavudine. Each capsule also contains inactive ingredients microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, anhydrous lactose, and magnesium stearate. The hard gelatin shell consists of gelatin, sodium lauryl sulfate, titanium dioxide, yellow iron oxide, and red iron oxide. The capsules are printed with black ink containing black iron oxide.</p><h2>Stavudine Capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Stavudine is an antiretroviral drug [<span class="Italics">see Microbiology (12.4)</span>].</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of stavudine have been evaluated in HIV-1-infected adult and pediatric patients (Tables 7, 8, and 9). Peak plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increased in proportion to dose after both single and multiple doses ranging from 0.03 to 4 mg/kg. There was no significant accumulation of stavudine with repeated administration every 6, 8, or 12 hours.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Absorption</span><br/>
<br/>
Following oral administration, stavudine is rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 1 hour after dosing. The systemic exposure to stavudine is the same following administration as capsules or solution. Steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of stavudine in HIV-1-infected adults are shown in Table 7.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span><br/>
<br/>
Binding of stavudine to serum proteins was negligible over the concentration range of 0.01 to 11.4 mcg/mL. Stavudine distributes equally between red blood cells and plasma. Volume of distribution is shown in Table 8.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Metabolism</span><br/>
<br/>
Metabolism plays a limited role in the clearance of stavudine. Unchanged stavudine was the major drug-related component circulating in plasma after an 80 mg dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-stavudine, while metabolites constituted minor components of the circulating radioactivity. Minor metabolites include oxidized stavudine, glucuronide conjugates of stavudine and its oxidized metabolite, and an <span class="Italics">N-</span>acetylcysteine conjugate of the ribose after glycosidic cleavage, suggesting that thymine is also a metabolite of stavudine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Elimination</span><br/>
<br/>
Following an 80 mg dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-stavudine to healthy subjects, approximately 95% and 3% of the total radioactivity was recovered in urine and feces, respectively. Radioactivity due to parent drug in urine and feces was 73.7% and 62%, respectively. The mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 2.3 hours following single oral doses. Mean renal clearance of the parent compound is approximately 272 mL/min, accounting for approximately 67% of the apparent oral clearance.<br/>
<br/>
In HIV-1-infected patients, renal elimination of unchanged drug accounts for about 40% of the overall clearance regardless of the route of administration (Table 8). The mean renal clearance was about twice the average endogenous creatinine clearance, indicating active tubular secretion in addition to glomerular filtration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span><br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Pediatric</span><br/>
<br/>
Pharmacokinetic parameters of stavudine in pediatric patients are presented in Table 9.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span><br/>
<br/>
Data from two studies in adults indicated that the apparent oral clearance of stavudine decreased and the terminal elimination half-life increased as creatinine clearance decreased (see Table 10). C<span class="Sub">max</span> and T<span class="Sub">max</span> were not significantly altered by renal impairment. The mean ± SD hemodialysis clearance value of stavudine was 120 ± 18 mL/min (n=12); the mean ± SD percentage of the stavudine dose recovered in the dialysate, timed to occur between 2 to 6 hours post-dose, was 31 ± 5%. Based on these observations, it is recommended that stavudine dosage be modified in patients with reduced creatinine clearance and in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis [see</p><p><span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span><br/>
<br/>
Stavudine pharmacokinetics were not altered in five non-HIV-infected patients with hepatic impairment secondary to cirrhosis (Child-Pugh classification B or C) following the administration of a single 40 mg dose. <span class="Italics"><br/>
<br/>
Geriatric</span><br/>
<br/>
Stavudine pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients &gt;65 years of age [See <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</span>]. <span class="Italics"><br/>
<br/>
Gender</span><br/>
<br/>
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of data collected during a controlled clinical study in HIV-1-infected patients showed no clinically important differences between males (n=291) and females (n=27). <span class="Italics"><br/>
<br/>
Race</span><br/>
<br/>
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of data collected during a controlled clinical study in HIV-1-infected patients showed no clinically important differences between races (n=233 Caucasian, 39 African-American, 41 Hispanic, 1 Asian, and 4 other).<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span><br/>
<br/>
Stavudine does not inhibit the major cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4; therefore, it is unlikely that clinically significant drug interactions will occur with drugs metabolized through these pathways. Because stavudine is not protein-bound, it is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of protein-bound drugs.<br/>
<br/>
Tables 11 and 12 summarize the effects on AUC and C<span class="Sub">max,</span> with a 95% confidence interval (CI) when available, following coadministration of stavudine with didanosine, lamivudine, and nelfinavir. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>Stavudine, a nucleoside analogue of thymidine, is phosphorylated by cellular kinases to the active metabolite stavudine triphosphate. Stavudine triphosphate inhibits the activity of   HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) by competing with the natural substrate thymidine triphosphate (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=0.0083 to 0.032 μM) and by causing DNA chain termination following its incorporation into viral DNA. Stavudine triphosphate inhibits cellular DNA polymerases β and γ and markedly reduces the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture</span></p><p>The cell culture antiviral activity of stavudine was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocytic cells, and lymphoblastoid cell lines. The concentration of drug necessary to inhibit HIV-1 replication by 50% (EC<span class="Sub">50</span>) ranged from 0.009 to 4 μM against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1. In cell culture, stavudine exhibited antagonistic activity in combination with zidovudine. The anti-HIV-1 activity of stavudine in combination with either abacavir, didanosine, tenofovir, or zalcitabine was not antagonistic. Ribavirin, at the 9 to 45 μM concentrations tested, reduced the anti-HIV-1 activity of stavudine by 2.5- to 5-fold. The relationship between cell culture susceptibility of HIV-1 to stavudine and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans has not been established.   </p><p><span class="Bold">Resistance</span></p><p>HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to stavudine have been selected in cell culture (strain-specific) and were also obtained from patients treated with stavudine. Phenotypic analysis of HIV-1 isolates from 61 patients receiving prolonged (6 to 29 months) stavudine monotherapy showed that post-therapy isolates from four patients exhibited EC<span class="Sub">50</span> values more than 4-fold (range 7- to 16-fold) higher than the average pretreatment susceptibility of baseline isolates. Of these, HIV-1 isolates from one patient contained the zidovudine-resistance-associated substitutions T215Y and K219E, and isolates from another patient contained the multiple-nucleoside-resistance-associated substitution Q151M. Mutations in the RT gene of HIV-1 isolates from the other two patients were not detected. The genetic basis for stavudine susceptibility changes has not been identified.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cross-resistance</span></p><p>Cross-resistance among HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been observed. Several studies have demonstrated that prolonged stavudine treatment can select and/or maintain thymidine analogue mutation (TAMs) substitutions in the HIV-1 RT (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219Q/E) associated with zidovudine resistance. HIV-1 isolates with one or more TAMs substitutions exhibited reduced susceptibility to stavudine in cell culture. These TAMs substitutions are seen at a similar frequency with stavudine and zidovudine in virological treatment. The clinical relevance of these findings suggests that stavudine should be avoided in the presence of thymidine analogue mutation substitutions.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">In 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats, stavudine was noncarcinogenic at doses which produced exposures (AUC) 39 and 168 times, respectively, human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. Benign and malignant liver tumors in mice and rats and malignant urinary bladder tumors in male rats occurred at levels of exposure 250 (mice) and 732 (rats) times human exposure at the recommended clinical dose.<br/>
<br/>
Stavudine was not mutagenic in the Ames, <span class="Italics">E. coli</span> reverse mutation, or the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assays, with and without metabolic activation. Stavudine produced positive results in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human lymphocyte clastogenesis and mouse fibroblast assays, and in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus test. In the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assays, stavudine elevated the frequency of chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes (concentrations of 25 to 250 mcg/mL, without metabolic activation) and increased the frequency of transformed foci in mouse fibroblast cells (concentrations of 25 to 2500 mcg/mL, with and without metabolic activation). In the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus assay, stavudine was clastogenic in bone marrow cells following oral stavudine administration to mice at dosages of 600 to 2000 mg/kg/day for 3 days.<br/>
<br/>
No evidence of impaired fertility was seen in rats with exposures (based on AUC) up to 137 times human exposure at the RHD.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Combination Therapy</span><br/>
<br/>
The combination use of stavudine is based on the results of clinical studies in HIV-1-infected patients in double- and triple-combination regimens with other antiretroviral agents.<br/>
<br/>
One of these studies (START 1) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study comparing stavudine (40 mg twice daily) plus lamivudine plus indinavir to zidovudine plus lamivudine plus indinavir in 202 treatment-naive patients. Both regimens resulted in a similar magnitude of inhibition of HIV-1 RNA levels and increases in CD4<span class="Sup">+</span>cell counts through 48 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Monotherapy</span><br/>
<span class="Bold"> </span><br/>
The efficacy of stavudine was demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind study (AI455-019, conducted 1992 to 1994) comparing stavudine with zidovudine in 822 patients with a spectrum of HIV-1-related symptoms. The outcome in terms of progression of HIV-1 disease and death was similar for both drugs.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Capsules </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Stavudine</span> <span class="Bold">Capsules USP, 15 mg</span> are dark red opaque/light yellow opaque size ‘4’ hard gelatin capsule filled with white to off white granular powder and imprinted with ‘E’ on dark red opaque cap and ‘76’ on light yellow opaque body with black ink.</p><p>Bottle of 60 Capsules                             NDC 64980-354-06</p><p><span class="Bold">Stavudine</span> <span class="Bold">Capsules USP, 20 mg</span> are light brown opaque/light brown opaque size ‘3’ hard gelatin capsule filled with white to off white granular powder and imprinted with ‘E’ on light brown opaque cap and ‘77’ on light brown opaque body with black ink.</p><p>Bottle of 60 Capsules                             NDC 64980-355-06</p><p><span class="Bold">Stavudine</span> <span class="Bold">Capsules USP, 30 mg</span> are dark orange opaque/light orange opaque size “2” hard gelatin capsule filled with white to off white granular powder and imprinted with “C” on dark orange opaque cap and “36” on light orange opaque body with black ink.</p><p>Bottle of 60 Capsules                             NDC 64980-356-06</p><p><span class="Bold">Stavudine</span> <span class="Bold">Capsules USP, 40 mg</span> are dark orange opaque/dark orange opaque size “1” hard gelatin capsule filled with white to off white granular powder and imprinted with “C” on dark orange opaque cap and “37” on dark orange opaque body with black ink.</p><p>Bottle of 60 Capsules                         NDC 64980-357-06<br/>
