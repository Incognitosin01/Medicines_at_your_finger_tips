</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke. <span class="Italics">[See CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]</span></span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Fayosim</h2><p class="First">Fayosim™ is indicated for use by females of reproductive age to prevent pregnancy.</p><h2>Fayosim Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>How to Take Fayosim</h3><p class="First">Instruct patients to take Fayosim once a day by mouth at the same time every day for 91 days. To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Fayosim must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours. For patient instructions regarding missed pills, see<span class="Italics"> FDA-approved patient labeling.</span></p><h3>How to Start Fayosim</h3><p class="First">For each 91-day course, take in the following order:</p><p>Begin the next and all subsequent 91-day courses of Fayosim without interruption on the same day of the week (i.e., Sunday) on which the patient began her first dose. Follow the same schedule as the initial 91-day course: pink tablet once a day for 42 days, white tablet once a day for 21 days, light blue tablet once a day for 21 days, and mustard tablet once a day for 7 days. If the patient does not immediately start her next pill pack, instruct her to protect herself from pregnancy by using a non-hormonal back-up method of contraception until she has taken a pink tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.</p><p>If unscheduled spotting or bleeding occurs, instruct the patient to continue on the same regimen. If the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, advise the patient to consult her healthcare provider.</p><p>For a postpartum woman who is not breastfeeding or after a second trimester abortion, start Fayosim no earlier than four weeks postpartum due to increased risk of thromboembolism. If the patient starts on Fayosim postpartum and has not yet had a period, evaluate for possible pregnancy, and instruct her to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken a pink tablet for 7 consecutive days. Consider the possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation.</p><h3>Advice in Case of Gastrointestinal Disturbances</h3><p class="First">In case of severe vomiting or diarrhea, absorption may not be complete and additional contraceptive measures should be taken. If vomiting or diarrhea occurs within 3 to 4 hours after taking a pink, white or light blue tablet, handle this as a missed tablet <span class="Italics">[see FDA-approved patient labeling].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Fayosim (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets, and ethinyl estradiol tablets) are available as round, film-coated, biconvex tablets debossed with "LU" on one side, packaged in Extended-Cycle wallet, each containing a 13-week supply of tablets in the following order:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>42 pink tablets, each containing 0.15 mg of levonorgestrel and 0.02 mg ethinyl estradiol: debossed with "U19" on the other side</li>
<li>21 white tablets containing 0.15 mg of levonorgestrel and 0.025 mg ethinyl estradiol: debossed with "U20" on the other side</li>

</ul><p>• Liver tumors, benign or malignant, or liver disease <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)</span> and <span class="Italics">USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6)].</span></p><p>• Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)]</span>.</p><p>• Pregnancy, because there is no reason to use COCs during pregnancy [see <span class="Italics">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9)</span> and <span class="Italics">USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)].</span></p><p>• Breast cancer or other estrogen- or progestin-sensitive cancer, now or in the past [see <span class="Italics">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.11)].</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">• Use of Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to the potential for ALT elevations <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)].</span></span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems</h3><p class="First">Stop Fayosim if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event (VTE) occurs. Stop Fayosim if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately.</p><p>If feasible, stop Fayosim at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE.</p><p>Start Fayosim no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.</p><p>The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4-week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.</p><p>Use of Fayosim provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year). In the clinical trial, three cases of deep vein thrombosis were reported.</p><p>Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt;35 years of age), and hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors.</p><p>Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.</p><h3>Liver Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Impaired Liver Function</span></span></p><p>Do not use Fayosim in women with acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]</span>.Acute disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Fayosim if jaundice develops.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Liver Tumors</span></span></p><p>Fayosim is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].</span> Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt; 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.</p><h3>High Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Fayosim is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]</span>. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Fayosim if blood pressure rises significantly.</p><p>An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin.</p><h3>Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment</h3><p class="First"> <span class="following_xmChange">During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains obmitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue Fayosim prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]</span>. Fayosim can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.</span></p><h3>Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease.</p><p>A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC-related cholestasis.</p><h3>Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</h3><p class="First">Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Fayosim. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion.</p><p>Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.</p><p>Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.</p><h3>Headache</h3><p class="First">If a woman taking Fayosim develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Fayosim if indicated.</p><p>Consider discontinuation of Fayosim in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (</span><span class="Italics">4)]</span>.</p><h3>Bleeding Irregularities</h3><p class="First">Bleeding and/or spotting that occurs at any time while taking the first 84 tablets (pink, white and light blue) of each extended-cycle regimen is considered "unscheduled" bleeding/spotting. Bleeding that occurs during the time a woman takes the seven tablets (mustard) containing 10 mcg of ethinyl estradiol is considered "scheduled" bleeding.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Unscheduled and Scheduled Bleeding and Spotting</span></span></p><p>Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles on Fayosim, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.</p><p>Before prescribing Fayosim, consider the occurrence of fewer scheduled menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) against the occurrence of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. A 12- month open-label study of the efficacy of Fayosim in preventing pregnancy assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)]</span> in 3,597 women who completed 34,087 28-day cycles of exposure. A total of 178 (4.9%) of the women discontinued Fayosim, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting.</p><p>Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly stable over time, with an average of 3 to 4 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle.</p><p>Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding, spotting, and unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting in Treatment Cycles 1 to 4.</p><p class="First Footnote">Q1 = Quartile 1: 25% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding/spotting<br/></p><p class="First Footnote">Median: 50% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding/spotting<br/></p><p class="First Footnote">Q3 = Quartile 3: 75% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding/spotting<br/></p><p>Figure 1 shows the percent of Fayosim subjects in the primary clinical trial with ≥ 7 days or ≥ 20 days of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, or just unscheduled bleeding, during each 91-day treatment cycle.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Percent of Women Taking Fayosim Who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea</span></span></p><p>Women who are not pregnant and use Fayosim may experience amenorrhea. Based on data from the clinical trial, amenorrhea occurred in approximately 1.9% of women during Cycle 1, 7.7% during Cycle 2, 10.7% during Cycle 3, and 10.1% during Cycle 4 using Fayosim. Rule out pregnancy in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</p><h3>COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Fayosim if pregnancy is confirmed.</p><p>The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Depression</h3><p class="First">Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Fayosim if depression recurs to a serious degree. Six cases of suicidality (suicide attempts and suicidal behavior) were reported in the clinical trial; several of these cases occurred in women with a psychiatric history.</p><h3>Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix</h3><p class="First">Fayosim is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (</span><span class="Italics">4)]</span>.</p><p>There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.</p><p>Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</p><h3>Effect on Binding Globulins</h3><p class="First">The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin sex hormone-binding globulin and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.</p><h3>Monitoring</h3><p class="First">A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated health care.</p><h3>Hereditary Angioedema</h3><p class="First">In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.</p><h3>Chloasma</h3><p class="First">Chloasma may occur with COC use, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Advise women who tend to develop chloasma to avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Fayosim.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Serious cardiovascular events and stroke <span class="Italics">[see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Vascular events <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Liver disease <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)]</span></li>
</ul><p>Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>  Irregular uterine bleeding</li>
<li>  Nausea</li>
<li>  Breast tenderness</li>
<li>  Headache</li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety data described below are from a 12-month, US, open-label study, which enrolled women aged 18 to 40, of whom 3,597 took at least one dose of Fayosim (2,661 woman-years of exposure) <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation</span></span></p><p>13.3% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions (≥ 1% of women) leading to discontinuation were heavy/irregular bleeding (5.0%), mood swings/alteration/affect lability (1.4%), headaches/migraines (1.3%), weight increased (1.3%) and acne (1.0%).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of women)</span></span></p><p>Headaches (12.2%), heavy/irregular vaginal bleeding (9.7%), nausea/vomiting (8.8%), acne (5.4%), dysmenorrhea (5.4%), weight increased (4.6%), mood changes (depression, depressed mood, crying, major depression, affective disorder, depression suicidal, dysthymic disorder) (2.9%), anxiety/panic attack (2.4%), breast tenderness/pain/discomfort (2.2%), migraine (2.0%).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Serious Adverse Reactions (≥ 2 women)</span></span></p><p>Abortion Spontaneous, Suicide Attempt, Cholecystitis/Cholelithiasis, Deep Vein Thrombosis, Ectopic Pregnancy.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of other extended-cycle COCs containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal disorders</span></span></p><p>Abdominal distension, vomiting</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">General disorders and administration site conditions</span></span></p><p>Chest pain, fatigue, malaise, edema peripheral, pain</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Immune system disorders</span></span></p><p>Hypersensitivity reaction</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Investigations</span></span></p><p>Blood pressure increased</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders</span></span></p><p>Muscle spasms, pain in extremity</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nervous system disorders</span></span></p><p>Dizziness, loss of consciousness</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Psychiatric disorders</span></span></p><p>Insomnia</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Reproductive and breast disorders</span></span></p><p>Dysmenorrhea</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders</span></span></p><p>Pulmonary embolism, pulmonary thrombosis</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders</span></span></p><p>Alopecia</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Vascular disorders</span></span></p><p>Thrombosis</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Consult the labeling of concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations.</p><p>No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Fayosim.</p><h3>Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Substances Diminishing the Efficacy of COCs</span></span></p><p>Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Substances Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs</span></span></p><p>Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors and Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors</span></span></p><p>Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Antibiotics</span></span></p><p>There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids.</p><h3>Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs</h3><p class="First">COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.</p><p>Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs.</p><h3>Concomitant Use with Hepatitis C Vaccine (HCV) Combination Therapy – Liver Enzyme Elevation</h3><p class="First">Do not co-administer Fayosim with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use COCs during early pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy.</p><p>The administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy. COCs should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">When possible, advise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception until she has weaned her child. COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well established; however, it can occur at any time in some women. Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites are present in breast milk.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of Fayosim have been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 as for users 18 years and older. Use of Fayosim before menarche is not indicated.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Fayosim has not been studied in women who have reached menopause and is not indicated in this population.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of Fayosim. However, steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic impairment. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. <span class="Italics">[See CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the disposition of Fayosim.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There have been no reports of serious ill effects from overdose of oral contraceptives, including ingestion by children. Overdosage may cause withdrawal bleeding in females and nausea.</p><h2>Fayosim Description</h2><p class="First">Fayosim (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP, and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP) is an extended-cycle oral contraceptive.

Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">No pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with Fayosim.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></span></p><p>Ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel are absorbed with maximum plasma concentrations occurring within 2 hours after Fayosim administration. Levonorgestrel is completely absorbed after oral administration (bioavailability nearly 100%) and is not subject to first-pass metabolism. Ethinyl estradiol is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but, due to first-pass metabolism in gut mucosa and liver, the bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol is approximately 40%. The effect of food on the rate and the extent of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol absorption following oral administration of Fayosim have not been evaluated.</p><p>The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of levonorgestrel following administration of another levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol combination tablet with an equal dose of levonorgestrel for 84 days, in healthy women are reported in Table 2.</p><p>Following repeated daily dosing of levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol oral contraceptives, levonorgestrel plasma concentrations accumulate more than predicted based on single-dose pharmacokinetics, due in part, to increased SHBG levels that are induced by ethinyl estradiol, and a possible reduction in hepatic metabolic capacity.</p><p>Systemic exposure to ethinyl estradiol following administration of a LNG/EE combination tablet increases linearly in an approximate dose-proportional manner over the range of doses of 20 mcg to 30 mcg within this product. Systemic exposure to EE (as assessed by AUC) at steady state following administration of levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol oral contraceptives is approximately 20% higher than expected based on single-dose data for the dose range of 20 to 30 mcg.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></span></p><p>The apparent volume of distribution of levonorgestrel is reported to be approximately 1.8 L/kg. Levonorgestrel is about 97.5 to 99% protein-bound, principally to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and, to a lesser extent, serum albumin.</p><p>The apparent volume of distribution of ethinyl estradiol is reported to be approximately 4.3 L/kg. Ethinyl estradiol is about 95 to 97% bound to serum albumin. Ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG, but induces SHBG synthesis, which leads to decreased levonorgestrel clearance.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></span></p><p>Following absorption, levonorgestrel is conjugated at the 17β-OH position to form sulfate and to a lesser extent, glucuronide conjugates in plasma. Significant amounts of conjugated and unconjugated 3α, 5β-tetrahydrolevonorgestrel are also present in plasma, along with much smaller amounts of 3α,5α-tetrahydrolevonorgestrel and 16β-hydroxylevonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel and its phase I metabolites are excreted primarily as glucuronide conjugates. Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several-fold, and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users.</p><p>First-pass metabolism of ethinyl estradiol involves formation of ethinyl estradiol-3-sulfate in the gut wall, followed by 2-hydroxylation of a portion of the remaining untransformed ethinyl estradiol by hepatic cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Levels of CYP3A4 vary widely among individuals and can explain the variation in rates of ethinyl estradiol hydroxylation. Hydroxylation at the 4-, 6-, and 16- positions may also occur, although to a much lesser extent than 2-hydroxylation. The various hydroxylated metabolites are subject to further methylation and/or conjugation.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></span></p><p>About 45% of levonorgestrel and its metabolites are excreted in the urine and about 32% are excreted in feces, mostly as glucuronide conjugates. The mean terminal elimination half-life for levonorgestrel after a single dose of Fayosim ranged from 36 to 41 hours.</p><p>Ethinyl estradiol is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, and it undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. The terminal elimination half-life of ethinyl estradiol following single doses of Fayosim is approximately 16.5 hours.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">[See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.11) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In a 12-month, multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical trial conducted in the US, 3,667 women, 18 to 40 years old, were enrolled and 3,565 were treated for up to four 91-day cycles, which equates to thirteen 28-day cycles, to assess the safety and efficacy of Fayosim, completing the equivalent of 33,895 28-day cycles of exposure. The racial demographic of those treated was: Caucasian (64%), African-American (19%), Hispanic (11%), Asian (2%), and Other (3%). There were no exclusions for body mass index (BMI) or weight. The weight range of those women treated was 83 to 402 lbs., with a mean weight of 162.5 lbs. Among the women in the trial, 44% were current hormonal contraceptive users, 39% were prior users (who had used hormonal contraceptives in the past), and 17% were new starters. Of treated women, 13.2% were lost to follow-up, 12.8% discontinued due to an adverse event, and 6.1% discontinued by withdrawing their consent.</p><p>The pregnancy rate (Pearl Index [PI]) in women aged 18 to 35 years was 3.19 pregnancies per 100 woman-years of use (95% confidence interval 2.49, 4.03), based on 70 pregnancies that occurred after the onset of treatment and up to and including 7 days after the last pill. Cycles in which conception did not occur, but which included the use of backup contraception, were not included in the calculation of the PI. The PI includes patients who did not take the drug correctly.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First">Fayosim (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP, and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP) are available in Extended-Cycle Wallets each containing a 13-week supply of tablets in the following order:</p><ul class="Disc">

However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.</p><p><span class="Bold">What Should I Know About My Period When Taking Fayosim?</span></p><p>When you take Fayosim, which has a 91-day extended dosing cycle, you should expect to have 4 scheduled periods per year (bleeding when you are taking the 7 mustard pills). Each period is likely to last about 3 to 4 days. However, you will probably have more bleeding or spotting between your scheduled periods than if you were using a birth control pill with a 28-day dosing cycle. This bleeding or spotting tends to decrease with each additional cycle. Do not stop taking Fayosim because of this bleeding or spotting. If the spotting continues for more than 7 consecutive days or if the bleeding is heavy, call your healthcare provider.</p><p><span class="Bold">What If I Miss My Scheduled Period When Taking Fayosim?</span></p><p>You should consider the possibility that you are pregnant if you miss your scheduled period (no bleeding on the days that you are taking mustard pills). Because scheduled periods are less frequent when you are taking Fayosim, notify your healthcare provider that you have missed your period and that you are taking Fayosim. Also notify your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. It is important that your healthcare provider evaluates you to determine if you are pregnant. Stop taking Fayosim if it is determined that you are pregnant.</p><p><span class="Bold">What If I Want To Become Pregnant?</span></p><p>You may stop taking the pill whenever you wish.
