The topical corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used topically as anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents.</p><p>Each gram of Prednicarbate Ointment 0.1% contains 1.0 mg of prednicarbate in a base consisting of white petrolatum, glyceryl monooleate, octyldodecanol NF, and propylene glycol.</p><p>Prednicarbate has the empirical formula C<span class="Sub">27</span>H<span class="Sub">36</span>O<span class="Sub">8</span> and a molecular weight of 488.58.</p><p>The CAS Registry Number is 73771-04-7.</p><p>The chemical structure is:</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">Like other topical corticosteroids, prednicarbate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span> inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics:</span> The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressings with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours have not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin while inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Studies performed with Prednicarbate Ointment 0.1% indicate that it is in the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First">Prednicarbate Ointment 0.1% is a medium potency corticosteroid indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Prednicarbate Ointment 0.1% is contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components in the preparations.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Information for Patients:</span> Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests:</span> The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression: ACTH stimulation test, A.M. plasma cortisol test, Urinary free cortisol test.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span> In a study of the effect of prednicarbate on fertility, pregnancy and postnatal development in rats, no effect was noted on the fertility or pregnancy of the parent animals or postnatal development of the offspring after administration of up to 0.80 mg/kg of prednicarbate subcutaneously. Prednicarbate has been evaluated in the Salmonella reversion test (Ames test) over a wide range of concentrations in the presence and absence of an S-9 liver microsomal fraction and did not demonstrate mutagenic activity. Similarly, prednicarbate did not produce any significant changes in the numbers of micronuclei seen in erythrocytes when mice were given doses ranging from 1 to 160 mg/kg of the drug.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy:</span> Teratogenic effects: <span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category C:</span> Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals.</p><p>Prednicarbate has been shown to be teratogenic and embryotoxic in Wistar rats and Himalayan rabbits when given subcutaneously during gestation at doses 1900 times and 45 times, respectively, the recommended topical human dose, assuming a percutaneous absorption of approximately 3%. In the rats, slightly retarded fetal development and an incidence of thickened and wavy ribs which were higher than the spontaneous rates were noted.</p><p>In rabbits, there was noted increased liver weights and slight increase in the fetal intrauterine death rate. The fetuses delivered exhibited reduced placental weight, increased frequency of cleft palate, ossification disorders in the sternum, omphalocele, and anomalous posture of forelimbs. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects of prednicarbate. Therefore, Prednicarbate Ointment 0.1% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Prednicarbate Ointment 0.1% is administered to a nursing woman.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> Safety and effectiveness of Prednicarbate Ointment 0.1% in pediatric patients below the age of 10 years have not been established. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA-axis suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing's syndrome while on treatment. Adverse effects, including striae, have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients. <span class="Bold">(See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>.)</span> HPA-axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">In controlled clinical studies, the incidence of adverse reactions associated with the use of Prednicarbate Ointment 0.1% was approximately 1.5%. Reported reactions including burning, pruritus, drying, scaling, cracking and pain and irritant dermatitis. The following additional local adverse reactions are reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids, but may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and especially with higher potency corticosteroids. These reactions are listed in approximate decreasing order of occurrence: folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae and miliaria.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First">Topically applied corticosteroids can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects <span class="Bold">(See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>.)</span></p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First">Apply a thin film of Prednicarbate Ointment 0.1% to the affected skin areas twice daily. Rub in gently.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED:</h2><p class="First">Prednicarbate Ointment 0.1% is supplied in</p><p>Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F).
