Dogs: <span class="Italics">Dipylidium caninum, Taenia pisiformis, Echinococcus granulosus</span> and for the removal and control of <span class="Italics">Echinococcus multilocularis</span>. Cats: <span class="Italics">Taenia taeniaeformis</span> and <span class="Italics">Dipylidium caninum</span>.</p><h2>ACTION:</h2><p class="First">Droncit (praziquantel) is absorbed, metabolized in the liver and excreted via the bile into the digestive tract where its cestocidal activity is exerted.<span class="Sup">1</span> Following exposure to praziquantel, the tapeworm loses its ability to resist digestion by the mammalian host. Because of this, whole tapeworms, including the scolex, are very rarely passed after administration of praziquantel. It is common to see only disintegrated and partially digested pieces of tapeworms in the stool. The majority of tapeworms killed are digested and are not found in the feces.</p><h2>USE DIRECTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Droncit (praziquantel) Injectable Cestocide may be administered by either the subcutaneous or intramuscular route to dogs and cats. The recommended dosage of praziquantel varies according to body weight. Smaller animals require a relatively larger dosage. The optimum dosage for each individual animal will be achieved by utilizing the following dosage schedule.</p><p><span class="Bold">DOGS AND PUPPIES†</span></p><p>Dogs:</p><p>5 lbs. and under      0.3 mL</p><p>6-10 lbs.                   0.5 mL</p><p>11-25 lbs.                1.0 mL</p><p>over 25 lbs.             0.2 mL /5 lbs.<br/>

The intramuscular route may be preferred in dogs due to a brief period of pain that occasionally follows subcutaneous administration. Anaphylactoid reactions were not observed in clinical trials. However, as with any drug an anaphylactoid reaction can occur with this product and should be treated symptomatically if it occurs.</p><p><span class="Bold">RETREATMENT:</span></p><p>For those animals living where reinfections are likely to occur, clients should be instructed in the steps to optimize prevention, otherwise, retreatment may be necessary. This is true in cases of <span class="Italics">Dipylidium caninum</span> where reinfection is almost certain to occur if fleas are not removed from the animal and its environment. In addition, for control of <span class="Italics">Echinococcus multilocularis</span>, a program of regular treatment every 21 to 26 days may be indicated (see <span class="Italics">E. multilocularis</span> section below).</p><p><span class="Bold">ECHINOCOCCUS MULTILOCULARIS:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Echinococcus multilocularisis</span> a tapeworm species ordinarily considered to be found in wild canids, including foxes, coyotes and wolves. The parasite has also been identified in domestic dogs and cats and potentially is a serious public health concern by involving humans as accidental intermediate hosts.</p><p>The life cycle of the parasite is based on a predator-prey relationship, as depicted above.</p><p>The adult tapeworm is small (1-4mm) and resides in the intestinal tract of the definitive host (wild or domestic canids). Eggs from the adult tapeworm are shed in the feces of the infected canid. Rodents such as mice and voles serve as the intermediate host for <span class="Italics">E. multilocularis</span>. Eggs ingested by rodents develop in the liver, lungs and other organs to form multilocular cysts. The life cycle is completed after a canid consumes a rodent infected with cysts. After ingestion of the infected rodent, larvae within the cyst develop to adult tapeworms in the intestinal tract of the canid. Eggs may begin to be passed in the feces of the canid approximately 28 days later.</p><p>This parasite poses a serious public health problem because of the possibility for human involvement in the life cycle. If eggs shed by an infected canid are accidentally ingested, a highly pathogenic condition (Alveolar Hydatid Disease) results from development of the cyst stage in humans.</p><p>The original geographic distribution of <span class="Italics">E. multilocularis</span> was primarily confined to northern areas of North America. Current evidence indicates migration of the parasite well into the continental United States.<span class="Sup">2</span>,<span class="Sup">3</span></p><p>Domestic dogs living in <span class="Italics">E. multilocularis</span> endemic areas that roam freely with the opportunity to catch wild rodents are at risk for infection. Pet owners should be advised on how to minimize this risk. Proper restraint of roaming dogs should be encouraged, along with regular treatment with Droncit Injectable solution, following the dosing schedule aforementioned and precautions indicated below.</p><p>Additional information on the life cycle and epidemiology of this parasite is available in veterinary parasitology texts.<span class="Sup">4</span>,<span class="Sup">5</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Diagnosis:</span></p><p>Diagnosis of <span class="Italics">E. multilocularis</span> in canids is difficult. The adult tapeworm produces no clinical signs of infection. Tapeworm segments (proglottids) are usually not observed in the feces. <span class="Italics">E. multilocularis</span> eggs, observed using microscopic fecal examination procedures, are similar in appearance to the common taeniid species of canids such as <span class="Italics">Taenia pisiformis</span>.</p><p>Assistance in the diagnosis of <span class="Italics">E. multilocularis</span> may be available from a state veterinary diagnostic laboratory. Additional information regarding areas where <span class="Italics">E. multilocularis</span> is suspected or has been confirmed may be obtained from area veterinary schools or the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, GA.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment</span>:</p><p>Dogs infected with <span class="Italics">E. multilocularis</span> should be treated to prevent exposure of humans to infective eggs and to reduce perpetuation of the parasite's life cycle.</p><p>The dosage of Droncit Injectable solution for removal of <span class="Italics">E. multilocularis</span> is the same as that indicated for the removal of the other tapeworm species listed on the label. Laboratory efficacy studies have demonstrated the recommended dosage is 100% efficacious for removal of this tapeworm.</p><p>Under condition of continual exposure to wild rodents, retreatment of the dog at 21-26 day intervals is recommended to prevent the shedding of infectious eggs.</p><h2>Precautions:</h2><p class="First">Strict hygienic precautions should be taken when handling dogs or feces suspected of harboring <span class="Italics">E. multilocularis</span>. Infected dogs treated for the first time with Droncit Injectable solution and dogs treated at intervals greater than 28 days may shed eggs in the feces after treatment. The animal should be held in the clinic during this interval and all feces should be incinerated or autoclaved. If these procedures are not possible, the eggs can be destroyed by soaking the feces in a sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solution of 3.75% or greater.<span class="Sup">6</span> All areas where the animal was maintained or in contact with should be thoroughly cleaned with sodium hypochlorite and allowed to dry completely before reuse.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First">The safety index has been derived from controlled safety evaluations, clinical trials and prior approved use in foreign countries. Dosages of 5 times the labeled rate at 14 day intervals to dogs as young as 4 weeks did not produce signs of clinical toxicity following either intramuscular or subcutaneous injections. No significant clinical chemistry, hematological, cholinesterase or histopathological changes occurred. Dosages of 5 times the labeled rate at 14 day intervals to kittens as young as 5 1/2 weeks did not produce signs of clinical toxicity following either intramuscular or subcutaneous injections. Symptoms of overdosage (33.8 to 40 times the labeled dosage rate) in adult dogs included vomition, excessive salivation and depression, but no deaths. Symptoms of overdosage (10 to 20 times the labeled dosage rate) in adult cats included vomition, depression, muscle tremors and incoordination. Deaths occurred in 5 of 8 cats treated subcutaneously and in all 8 injected intramuscularly at doses greater than 20 times the label rate.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">There are no known contraindications to the use of praziquantel.</p><h2>PREGNANCY:</h2><p class="First">Droncit (praziquantel) has been tested in breeding and pregnant dogs and cats. No adverse effects were noted.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Mild side effects were observed in 18 of 189 dogs (9.5%) and 8 of 85 cats (9.4%) administered Droncit Injectable in field trials. For dogs the majority of these were described as brief pain responses following injections to larger dogs (weighing over 50 lbs.). Two dogs exhibited a brief period of mild vomiting and/or drowsy or staggering gait. The eight cats exhibited either diarrhea, weakness, vomition, salivation, sleepiness, burning on injection and/or a temporary lack of appetite. Local irritation or swelling at the site of subcutaneous injections have been reported for cats.</p><p>For customer service or to obtain product information, including Material Safety Data Sheet, call 1-800-633-3796.
