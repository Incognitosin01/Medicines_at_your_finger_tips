You may need a dose adjustment or special tests to safely use Sancuso.</p><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package. Tell each of your healthcare providers about all your medical conditions, allergies, and all medicines you use.</p><p>Avoid exposing the skin patch or your upper arm to sunlight, sunlamps, or tanning beds.

Wear protective clothing over your arms while you are wearing the skin patch and for at least 10 days after you remove a patch. Do not use Sancuso during a time when you are not having chemotherapy, unless your doctor has told you to.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Sancuso if you are allergic to granisetron.</p><p>To make sure Sancuso is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>

Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Apply the Sancuso patch to clean, dry, and hairless skin on the outer part of your upper arm. Avoid placing the patch on skin that is red, irritated, or damaged. Press the patch firmly into place and make sure it is well sealed around the edges.</p><p>Leave the patch in place during your chemotherapy treatment, and for at least 24 hours after your treatment has ended. Peel off the patch gently when removing it.</p><p>You may continue wearing a Sancuso skin patch for up to 7 days if needed, depending on your chemotherapy schedule.

Do not use the same skin area twice within 7 days.</p><p><b>Do not wear more than one Sancuso patch at a time.</b> Using extra skin patches will not make the medicine more effective. Never cut a skin patch.</p><p>If a patch falls off, try sticking it back into place. If it does not stick well, put on a new patch and leave it on only for the rest of your wearing time. Do not change your patch removal schedule.</p><p>After removing a patch, fold it in half so it sticks together and throw it away in a place where children or pets cannot get to it.</p><p>Sancuso is not likely to be useful if you keep using it during times when you are not receiving chemotherapy.</p><p>Do not share this medicine with another person.</p><p>Keep each patch in its foil pouch until you are ready to use it.
