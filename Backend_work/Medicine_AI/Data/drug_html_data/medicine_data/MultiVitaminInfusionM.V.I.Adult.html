</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Multi Vitamin Infusion M.V.I. Adult</h2><p class="First">M.V.I. Adult™ is a combination of vitamins indicated for the prevention of vitamin deficiency in adults and pediatric patients aged 11 years and above receiving parenteral nutrition.</p><p>The physician should not await the development of clinical signs of vitamin deficiency before initiating vitamin therapy.</p><h2>Multi Vitamin Infusion M.V.I. Adult Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">M.V.I. Adult is a combination product that contains the following vitamins: ascorbic acid, vitamin A, vitamin D, thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, dexpanthenol, vitamin E, vitamin K, folic acid, biotin, and vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>.</p><p>M.V.I. Adult is supplied as a single dose or as a pharmacy bulk package for intravenous use intended for administration by intravenous infusion after dilution:</p><p>Do not administer M.V.I. Adult as a direct, undiluted intravenous injection as it may cause dizziness, faintness, and tissue irritation.</p><h3>Dosage Information</h3><p class="First">The recommended daily dosage volume is 10 mL. One daily dose (10 mL) is diluted by adding directly to a specified volume of an intravenous fluid <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><p>Patients with multiple vitamin deficiencies or with increased vitamin requirements may need multiple daily dosages as indicated or additional doses of individual vitamins.</p><h3>Preparation and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">M.V.I. Adult supplied as a single dose:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">M.V.I. Adult supplied as a pharmacy bulk package:</span></p><h3>Monitoring Vitamin Blood Levels</h3><p class="First">Blood vitamin concentrations should be monitored to ensure maintenance of adequate levels, particularly in patients receiving parenteral multivitamins as the only source of vitamins for long periods of time.</p><h3>Drug Incompatibilities</h3><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">M.V.I. Adult is an injection available as a:</p><p>See Description section for vitamin strengths <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)].</span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">M.V.I. Adult is contraindicated in patients who have:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Decreased Anticoagulant Effect of Warfarin</h3><p class="First">M.V.I. Adult contains Vitamin K which may decrease the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. In patients who are on warfarin anticoagulant therapy receiving M.V.I. Adult, prothrombin time/INR should be periodically monitored to determine if the dose of warfarin needs to be adjusted.</p><h3>Aluminum Toxicity</h3><p class="First">M.V.I. Adult contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.</p><p>Patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 micrograms per kg per day, accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. To prevent aluminum toxicity monitor periodically aluminum levels with prolonged parenteral administration of M.V.I. Adult.</p><h3>Risk of Low Vitamin A Levels</h3><p class="First">Vitamin A may adhere to plastic, resulting in lower vitamin A concentrations after administration of M.V.I. Adult. Therefore, blood vitamin concentrations should be periodically monitored and the administration of additional therapeutic doses of Vitamin A may be required.</p><h3>Allergic Reactions to Thiamine</h3><p class="First">Allergic reactions such as urticaria, periorbital and digital edema, have been reported following intravenous administration of thiamine, which is found in M.V.I. Adult. There have been rare reports of anaphylaxis following intravenous doses of thiamine. No fatal anaphylaxis reactions associated with M.V.I. Adult have been reported.</p><h3>Hypervitaminosis A</h3><p class="First">Hypervitaminosis A, manifested by nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, has been reported in patients with renal failure receiving 1.5 mg/day retinol and in patients with liver disease. Therefore, supplementation of renal failure patients and patients with liver diseases with vitamin A, an ingredient found in M.V.I. Adult, should be undertaken with caution <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)]</span>. Blood levels of Vitamin A should be monitored periodically.</p><h3>Interference with Diagnosis of Megaloblastic Anemia</h3><p class="First">M.V.I. Adult contains folic acid and cyanocobalamin which can mask serum deficits of folic acid and cyanocobalamin in patients with megaloblastic anemia. Avoid the use of M.V.I. Adult in patients with suspected or diagnosed megaloblastic anemia prior to blood sampling for the detection of the folic acid and cyanocobalamin deficiencies.</p><h3>Potential to Develop Vitamin Deficiencies or Excesses</h3><p class="First">In patients receiving parenteral multivitamins, such as with M.V.I. Adult, blood vitamin concentrations should be periodically monitored to determine if vitamin deficiencies or excesses are developing. M.V.I. Adult may not correct long-standing specific vitamin deficiencies. The administration of additional doses of specific vitamins may be required <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Interference with Urine Glucose Testing</h3><p class="First">M.V.I. Adult contains Vitamin C which is also known as ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid in the urine may cause false negative urine glucose determinations.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other section of the labeling.</p><p>The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of M.V.I. Adult. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Dermatologic</span>: rash, erythema, pruritus<br/>
<span class="Italics">CNS</span>: headache, dizziness, agitation, anxiety<br/>
<span class="Italics">Ophthalmic</span>: diplopia</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Effect of M.V.I. Adult on Other Drugs</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Phenytoin:</span> Folic acid may increase phenytoin metabolism and lower the serum concentration of phenytoin resulting in increased seizure activity.</p><p><span class="Bold">Methotrexate:</span> Folic acid may decrease a patient's response to methotrexate therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Levodopa:</span> Pyridoxine may increase the metabolism of levodopa (decrease blood level of levodopa) and decrease its efficacy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antibiotics:</span> Thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, and ascorbic acid decrease antibiotic activities of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Bleomycin:</span> Ascorbic acid and riboflavin inactivate bleomycin <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, thus the activity of bleomycin may be reduced.</p><h3>Effect of Other Drugs on M.V.I. Adult</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hydralazine or Isoniazid:</span></p><p>Concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid may increase pyridoxine requirements.</p><p><span class="Bold">Phenytoin:</span></p><p>Phenytoin may decrease serum folic acid concentrations.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Administration of the approved recommended dose of M.V.I. Adult in parenteral nutrition is not expected to cause major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Pregnant women should follow the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances for pregnancy because their vitamin requirements may exceed those of nonpregnant women. Deficiency of essential vitamins may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</span>. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with M.V.I. Adult administered by intravenous infusion.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</span></p><p>Deficiency of essential vitamins has been associated with adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes, such as maternal folic acid deficiency and an increased risk of neural tube defects. Therefore, parental nutrition with multiple vitamins injection should be considered if a pregnant woman's nutritional requirements cannot be fulfilled by oral or enteral intake.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Multiple vitamins present in M.V.I. Adult are also present in human milk. Administration of the approved recommended dose of M.V.I. Adult in parenteral nutrition is not expected to cause harm to a breastfed infant. There is no information on the effects of M.V.I. Adult on milk production. Lactating women should follow the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances for their condition, because their vitamin requirements may exceed those of nonlactating women. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for M.V.I. Adult and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from M.V.I. Adult or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">M.V.I. Adult is indicated for the prevention of vitamin deficiency in pediatric patients aged 11 years and older receiving parenteral nutrition. M.V.I. Adult is not indicated for use in pediatric patients below the age of 11 years.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">M.V.I. Adult has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Monitor renal function, calcium, phosphorus and vitamin A levels in patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">M.V.I. Adult has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Monitor vitamin A level in patients with liver disease or high alcohol consumption <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Signs and symptoms of acute or chronic overdosage may be those of individual M.V.I. Adult component toxicity. There is no clinical experience with M.V.I. Adult overdosage.</p><h2>Multi Vitamin Infusion M.V.I. Adult Description</h2><p class="First">M.V.I.
