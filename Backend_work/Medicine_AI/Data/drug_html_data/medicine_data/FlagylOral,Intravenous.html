The <i>extended-release tablets</i> are used to treat women with vaginal infections (bacterial vaginosis).</p><p>Metronidazole belongs to the class of medicines known as antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. However, this medicine will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Flagyl</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of metronidazole <i>capsules</i> and <i>tablets</i> in the pediatric population, except for the treatment of amebiasis. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of metronidazole <i>extended-release tablets</i> to treat bacterial vaginosis in teenage females, but should not be used before the start of menstruation.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of metronidazole in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects and age-related liver problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving metronidazole.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>If you are using this medicine for <i>trichomoniasis</i> (an infection of the sex organs in men or women), your doctor may want to treat your sexual partner at the same time you are being treated, even if he or she has no symptoms.
