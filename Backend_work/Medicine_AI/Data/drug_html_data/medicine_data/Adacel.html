Most people in this age group require only one Tdap shot for protection against these diseases.</p><p>Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis are serious diseases caused by bacteria.</p><p>Tetanus (lockjaw) causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to "locking" of the jaw so the victim cannot open the mouth or swallow. Tetanus leads to death in about 1 out of 10 cases.</p><p>Diphtheria causes a thick coating in the nose, throat, and airways. It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, or death.</p><p>Pertussis (whooping cough) causes coughing so severe that it can interfere with eating, drinking, or breathing. These spells can last for weeks and can lead to pneumonia, seizures (convulsions), brain damage, and death.</p><p>Diphtheria and pertussis are spread from person to person. Tetanus enters the body through a cut or wound.</p><p>Adacel is especially important for healthcare workers or people who have close contact with a baby younger than 12 months old.</p><p>Adacel vaccine works by exposing you to a small dose of the bacteria or a protein from the bacteria, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>Like any vaccine, the Adacel may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>In most cases,Adacel is given in only one dose. Follow your doctor's instructions about receiving a booster dose if needed.</p><p>You can still receive the Adacel vaccine if you have a minor cold. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving Adacel.</p><p>You should not receive Adacel if you have ever had had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis vaccine. You also should not receive this vaccine if you had a neurologic disorder affecting your brain within 7 days after having a previous pertussis vaccine.</p><p>Becoming infected with diphtheria, pertussis, or tetanus is much more dangerous to your health than receiving the Adacel vaccine. However, like any medicine, this vaccine can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive Adacel if:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>you had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any vaccine that contains tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis; or</p>

However, you may need a Adacel during pregnancy to protect your newborn baby from pertussis. <b>Young babies are most at risk for severe, life-threatening complications from pertussis.</b> Your doctor should determine whether you need this vaccine during pregnancy.</p><p>If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry. This is to track the outcome of the pregnancy and to evaluate any effects of the Adacel on the baby.</p><p>It is not known whether Tdap vaccine passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><p>Adacel should not be given to anyone under the age of 10. Another vaccine is available for use in children younger than 10 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is Adacel given?</h2><p>Adacel is given as an injection (shot) into a muscle.

Unless your doctor's tells you otherwise, you will not need a booster vaccine.</p><p>Adacel is usually given once every 10 years.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Adacel vaccine is usually given only once, you are not likely to miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of this vaccine is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid before or after receiving Adacel?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity after receiving Adacel.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Adacel side effects</h2><p>Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving Adacel vaccine. If you ever need to receive a booster dose, you will need to tell your doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects.</p><p>You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.</p><p>Becoming infected with diphtheria, pertussis, or tetanus is much more dangerous to your health than receiving this vaccine.
