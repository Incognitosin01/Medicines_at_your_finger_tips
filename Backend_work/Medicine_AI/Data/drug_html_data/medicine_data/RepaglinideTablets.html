</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Repaglinide Tablets</h2><p class="First">Repaglinide Tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitation of Use:</span></p><p>Repaglinide Tablets should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.</p><h2>Repaglinide Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosage and Administration</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dose for patients whose HbA <span class="Sub">1c</span> is less than 8% is 0.5 mg orally before each meal. For patients whose HbA <span class="Sub">1c</span> is 8% or greater the starting dose is 1 mg or 2 mg orally before each meal.</p><p>The recommended dose range is 0.5 mg to 4 mg before meals, with a maximum daily dose of 16 mg. The patient’s dose should be doubled up to 4 mg with each meal until satisfactory glycemic control is achieved. At least one week should elapse to assess response after each dose adjustment.</p><p>Instruct patients to take Repaglinide Tablets within 30 minutes before meals. Repaglinide Tablets may be dosed 2, 3, or 4 times a day in response to changes in the patient’s meal pattern.</p><p>In patients who skip meals, instruct patients to skip the scheduled dose of Repaglinide Tablets to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. In patients who experience hypoglycemia, the dose of Repaglinide Tablets should be reduced <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><h3>Patients with Severe Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl = 20 mL/min to 40 mL/min) initiate Repaglinide Tablets 0.5 mg orally before each meal. Gradually titrate the dose, if needed to achieve glycemic control.</p><h3>Dose Modifications for Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Dosage adjustments are recommended in patients taking concomitant strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inducers <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>Concomitant use with gemfibrozil is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><p>Avoid concomitant use of Repaglinide Tablets with clopidogrel. If concomitant use can not be avoided, initiate Repaglinide Tablets at 0.5 mg before each meal and do not exceed a total daily dose of 4 mg <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>Do not exceed a total daily dose of 6 mg of Repaglinide Tablets in patients receiving cyclosporine <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Repaglinide Tablets, USP are available containing 0.5 mg, 1 mg or 2 mg of repaglinide, USP.</p><ul>
<li>The 0.5 mg tablets are white to off-white, round, unscored tablets debossed with <span class="Bold">M</span> on one side of the tablet and <span class="Bold">R21</span> on the other side.</li>
<li>The 1 mg tablets are light blue, round, unscored tablets debossed with <span class="Bold">M</span> on one side of the tablet and <span class="Bold">R22</span> on the other side.</li>
<li>The 2 mg tablets are light green, round, unscored tablets debossed with <span class="Bold">M</span> on one side of the tablet and <span class="Bold">R23</span> on the other side.</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Repaglinide Tablets are contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul>
<li>Concomitant use of gemfibrozil <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span></li>
<li>Known hypersensitivity to repaglinide or any inactive ingredients</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">All glinides, including Repaglinide Tablets, can cause hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span> . Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening, or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery).</p><p>Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span> , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.</p><p>Factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content), changes in level of physical activity, changes to co-administered medication <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span> , and concomitant use with other antidiabetic agents. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].</span></p><p>Patients should administer Repaglinide Tablets before meals and be instructed to skip the dose of Repaglinide Tablets if a meal is skipped. In patients who experience hypoglycemia, the dose of Repaglinide Tablets should be reduced <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].</span> Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.</p><h3>Serious Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Use with NPH-insulin</h3><p class="First">Across seven controlled trials, there were six serious adverse events of myocardial ischemia in patients treated with Repaglinide Tablets plus NPH-insulin from two studies, and one event in patients using insulin formulations alone from another study <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> Repaglinide Tablets are not indicated for use in combination with NPH-insulin.</p><h3>Macrovascular Outcomes</h3><p class="First">There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Repaglinide Tablets.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reaction is also described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><p>Hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice.</p><p>Repaglinide Tablets have been administered to 2931 individuals during clinical trials. Approximately 1500 of these individuals with type 2 diabetes have been treated for at least 3 months, 1000 for at least 6 months, and 800 for at least 1 year. The majority of these individuals (1228) received Repaglinide Tablets in one of five 1-year, active-controlled trials. Over one year, 13% of Repaglinide Tablets patients were discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to withdrawal were hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and related symptoms <span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>Table 1 lists the common adverse reactions for Repaglinide Tablets patients compared to placebo in trials 12 to 24 weeks duration.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Repaglinide Tablets</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 352</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 108</span></p><p class="First">Upper Respiratory Infection</p><p class="First">16</p><p class="First">8</p><p class="First">Headache</p><p class="First">11</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">Sinusitis</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">Arthralgia</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">Nausea</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">Diarrhea</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">Back Pain</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">Rhinitis</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">Constipation</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">Vomiting</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">Paresthesia</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">Chest Pain</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">Bronchitis</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">Dyspepsia</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">Urinary Tract Infection</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">Tooth Disorder</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">Allergy</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">In clinical trials with Repaglinide Tablets, hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction. Mild or moderate hypoglycemia occurred in 31% of Repaglinide Tablets treated patients and 7% of placebo treated patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><p>Hypoglycemia was reported in 16% of 1228 Repaglinide Tablets patients, 20% of 417 glyburide patients, and 19% of 81 glipizide patients in 1-year controlled trials.

The average weight gain in patients treated with Repaglinide Tablets and not previously treated with sulfonylurea drugs was 3.3%.</p><p class="First">The incidence of total serious cardiovascular adverse events, including ischemia, was higher for Repaglinide Tablets (51/1228 or 4%) than for sulfonylurea drugs (13/498 or 3%) in controlled comparator clinical trials.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Repaglinide Tablets</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">SU</span>*</p><p class="First">Total Exposed</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">1228</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">498</span></p><p class="First">Serious CV Events</p><p class="First">4%</p><p class="First">3%</p><p class="First">Cardiac Ischemic Events</p><p class="First">2%</p><p class="First">2%</p><p class="First">Deaths due to CV Events</p><p class="First">0.5%</p><p class="First">0.4%</p><p>Seven controlled clinical trials included Repaglinide Tablets combination therapy with NPH-insulin (n = 431), insulin formulations alone (n = 388) or other combinations (sulfonylurea plus NPH-insulin or Repaglinide Tablets plus metformin) (n = 120). There were six serious adverse events of myocardial ischemia in patients treated with Repaglinide Tablets plus NPH-insulin from two studies, and one event in patients using insulin formulations alone from another study <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><p class="First">During 24-week treatment clinical trials of Repaglinide Tablets-rosiglitazone or Repaglinide Tablets-pioglitazone combination therapy (a total of 250 patients in combination therapy), hypoglycemia (blood glucose &lt; 50 mg/dL) occurred in 7% of patients in combination therapy compared to 7% for Repaglinide Tablets monotherapy, and 2% for thiazolidinedione monotherapy.</p><p class="First">Peripheral edema was reported in 12 out of 250 (4.8%) Repaglinide Tablets-thiazolidinedione combination therapy patients and 3 out of 124 (2.4%) thiazolidinedione monotherapy patients, with no cases reported in these trials for Repaglinide Tablets monotherapy. There were reports in 2 of 250 patients (0.8%) treated with Repaglinide Tablets-thiazolidinedione therapy of episodes of edema with congestive heart failure. Both patients had a prior history of coronary artery disease and recovered after treatment with diuretic agents. No comparable cases in the monotherapy treatment groups were reported.</p><p class="First">Mean weight increases associated with combination, Repaglinide Tablets and pioglitazone therapy were 5.5 kg, 0.3 kg, and 2.0 kg respectively. Mean weight increases associated with combination, Repaglinide Tablets and rosiglitazone therapy were 4.5 kg, 1.3 kg, and 3.3 kg respectively.</p><p class="First">Less common adverse clinical or laboratory events observed in clinical trials included elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anaphylactoid reactions.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Repaglinide Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><ul>

It is unknown whether Repaglinide Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Repaglinide Tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>Repaglinide was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits at doses 40 times (rats) and approximately 0.8 times (rabbit) clinical exposure (on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis) throughout pregnancy. Offspring of rat dams exposed to repaglinide at 15 times clinical exposure on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis during days 17 to 22 of gestation and during lactation developed nonteratogenic skeletal deformities consisting of shortening, thickening, and bending of the humerus during the postnatal period. This effect was not seen at doses up to 2.5 times clinical exposure (on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis) on days 1 to 22 of pregnancy or at higher doses given during days 1 to 16 of pregnancy. Relevant human exposure has not occurred to date and therefore the safety of Repaglinide Tablets administration throughout pregnancy or lactation cannot be established.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Although it is not known whether repaglinide is excreted in human milk some oral agents are known to be excreted by this route. Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist, and because of the effects on nursing animals, a decision should be made as to whether Repaglinide Tablets should be discontinued in nursing mothers, or if mothers should discontinue nursing. If Repaglinide Tablets are discontinued and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered. In rat reproduction studies, measurable levels of repaglinide were detected in the breast milk of the dams and lowered blood glucose levels were observed in the pups. Cross fostering studies indicated that skeletal changes <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span> could be induced in control pups nursed by treated dams, although this occurred to a lesser degree than those pups treated <span class="Italics">in utero</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In clinical studies of 24 weeks or greater duration, 415 patients were over 65 years of age and no patients were greater than 75 years of age. In one-year, active-controlled trials, no differences were seen in effectiveness or adverse events between these subjects and those less than 65. There was no increase in frequency or severity of hypoglycemia in older subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to Repaglinide Tablets therapy cannot be ruled out.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Pharmacokinetic studies of repaglinide were conducted in patients with mild to moderate renal function impairment (CrCl = 40 mL/min to 80 mL/min), and severe renal function impairment (CrCl = 20 mL/min to 40 mL/min). Initial dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction. However, patients with severe renal function impairment should initiate Repaglinide Tablets therapy with the 0.5 mg dose and be carefully titrated <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span></p><p>Studies were not conducted in patients with creatinine clearances below 20 mL/min or patients with renal failure requiring hemodialysis.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">A single-dose study was conducted 12 patients with chronic liver disease. Patients with moderate to severe impairment of liver function had higher and more prolonged serum concentrations. Therefore, Repaglinide Tablets should be used cautiously in patients with impaired liver function. Longer intervals between dose adjustments may be needed to allow full assessment of response.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Severe hypoglycemic reactions with coma, seizure, or other neurological impairment may occur and constitute medical emergencies requiring immediate hospitalization. Hypoglycemic symptoms without loss of consciousness or neurologic findings should be treated aggressively with oral glucose and adjustments in drug dosage and/or meal patterns. Close monitoring may continue until the physician is assured that the patient is out of danger. Patients should be closely monitored for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours, since hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. There is no evidence that Repaglinide Tablets are dialyzable using hemodialysis.</p><h2>Repaglinide Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Repaglinide is an oral blood glucose-lowering drug of the glinide class. Repaglinide, S(+)2-ethoxy-4(2((3-methyl-1-(2-(1-piperidinyl) phenyl)-butyl) amino)-2-oxoethyl) benzoic acid, is chemically unrelated to the oral sulfonylurea insulin secretagogues.</p><p><span class="Bold">Structural Formula of Repaglinide</span></p><p>Repaglinide, USP is a white to off-white solid with molecular formula C <span class="Sub">27</span>H <span class="Sub">36</span>N <span class="Sub">2</span>O <span class="Sub">4</span> and a molecular weight of 452.6. Repaglinide Tablets, USP contain 0.5 mg, 1 mg or 2 mg of repaglinide. In addition each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: butylated hydroxyanisole, colloidal silicon dioxide, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, dibasic calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, meglumine, microcrystalline cellulose, polacrilin potassium, povidone and sodium lauryl sulfate. The 1 mg and 2 mg tablets also contain FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 Aluminum Lake and the 2 mg tablets also contain D&amp;C Yellow No.10 Aluminum Lake as coloring agents.</p><h2>Repaglinide Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Repaglinide lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas. This action is dependent upon functioning beta (ß) cells in the pancreatic islets. Insulin release is glucose-dependent and diminishes at low glucose concentrations.</p><p>Repaglinide closes ATP-dependent potassium channels in the ß-cell membrane by binding at characterizable sites. This potassium channel blockade depolarizes the ß-cell, which leads to an opening of calcium channels. The resulting increased calcium influx induces insulin secretion. The ion channel mechanism is highly tissue selective with low affinity for heart and skeletal muscle.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">A four-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-response trial was conducted in 138 patients with type 2 diabetes using doses ranging from 0.25 mg (not an approved dose) to 4 mg taken with each of three meals. Repaglinide Tablets therapy resulted in dose-proportional glucose lowering over the full dose range. Plasma insulin levels increased after meals and reverted toward baseline before the next meal. Most of the fasting blood glucose-lowering effect was demonstrated within 1 to 2 weeks.</p><p>In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-month dose titration study, Repaglinide Tablets or placebo doses for each patient were increased weekly from 0.25 mg (not an approved dose) through 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg, to a maximum of 4 mg, until a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level &lt; 160 mg/dL was achieved or the maximum dose reached. The dose that achieved the targeted control or the maximum dose was continued to end of study. FPG and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) increased in patients receiving placebo and decreased in patients treated with repaglinide. Differences between the repaglinide- and placebo-treated groups were -61 mg/dL (FPG) and -104 mg/dL (PPG) (Table 4).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mean Change from Baseline after 3 Months of Treatment</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Repaglinide</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">N</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">66</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">33</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Fasting Plasma Glucose (mg/dL)</span></p><p class="First">Baseline</p><p class="First">220.2</p><p class="First">215.3</p><p class="First">Change from baseline</p><p>(at last visit)</p><p class="First">-31.0 *</p><p class="First">30.3</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Post Prandial Glucose (mg/ dL)</span></p><p class="First">Baseline</p><p class="First">261.7</p><p class="First">245.2</p><p class="First">Change from baseline</p><p>(at last visit)</p><p class="First">-47.6 *</p><p class="First">56.5</p><p>The dosing of Repaglinide Tablets relative to meal-related insulin release was studied in three trials including 58 patients. Glycemic control was maintained during a period in which the meal and dosing pattern was varied (2, 3 or 4 meals per day; before meals x 2, 3, or 4) compared with a period of 3 regular meals and 3 doses per day (before meals x 3). Blood glucose-lowering effect did not differ when Repaglinide Tablets were administered at the start of a meal, 15 minutes before, or 30 minutes before the meal.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetic parameters of repaglinide obtained from a single-dose, crossover study in healthy subjects and from a multiple-dose, parallel, dose-proportionality (0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg) study in patients with type 2 diabetes are summarized in Tables 5 and 6. These data indicate that repaglinide did not accumulate in serum. Clearance of oral repaglinide did not change over the 0.5 mg to 4 mg dose range, indicating a linear relationship between dose and plasma drug levels.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Parameter</span></p><p class="First">CL (based on i.v.)</p><p class="First">38 L/hr ± 16 L/hr</p><p class="First">V <span class="Sub">ss</span> (based on i.v.)</p><p class="First">31 L ± 12 L</p><p class="First">AbsBio</p><p class="First">56% ± 9%</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetic Parameter</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(mg)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">AUC <span class="Sub">0-24 hr</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">(ng/mL <span class="Sup">*</span>hr)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Mean (SD)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">C <span class="Sub">max 0-5 hr</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">(ng/mL)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Mean (SD)</span></p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">68.9 (154.4)</p><p class="First">9.8 (10.2)</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">125.8 (129.8)</p><p class="First">18.3 (9.1)</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">152.4 (89.60)</p><p class="First">26.0 (13.0)</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">447.4 (211.3)</p><p class="First">65.8 (30.1)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">T <span class="Sub">max 0-5 hr</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Means (SD)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">T <span class="Sup">1/2</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Means (Ind Range)</span></p><p class="First">0.5 - 4</p><p class="First">1.0 to 1.4 (0.3 to 0.5) hr</p><p class="First">1.0 to 1.4 (0.4 to 8.0) hr</p><p class="First">After oral administration, repaglinide is completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After single and multiple oral doses in healthy subjects or in patients, peak plasma drug levels (C <span class="Sub">max</span>) occur within 1 hour (T <span class="Sub">max</span>). Repaglinide is eliminated from the blood stream with a half-life of approximately 1 hour. The mean absolute bioavailability is 56%. When repaglinide was given with food, the mean T <span class="Sub">max</span> was not changed, but the mean C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC (area under the time/plasma concentration curve) were decreased 20% and 12.4%, respectively.</p><p class="First">After intravenous (IV) dosing in healthy subjects, the volume of distribution at steady state (V <span class="Sub">ss</span>) was 31 L, and the total body clearance (CL) was 38 L/h. Protein binding and binding to human serum albumin was greater than 98%.</p><p class="First">Repaglinide is completely metabolized by oxidative biotransformation and direct conjugation with glucuronic acid after either an IV or oral dose. The major metabolites are an oxidized dicarboxylic acid (M2), the aromatic amine (M1), and the acyl glucuronide (M7). The cytochrome P-450 enzyme system, specifically 2C8 and 3A4, have been shown to be involved in the N-dealkylation of repaglinide to M2 and the further oxidation to M1. Metabolites do not contribute to the glucose-lowering effect of repaglinide. Within 96 hours after dosing with <span class="Sup">14</span>C-repaglinide as a single, oral dose, approximately 90% of the radiolabel was recovered in the feces and approximately 8% in the urine. Only 0.1% of the dose is cleared in the urine as parent compound. The major metabolite (M2) accounted for 60% of the administered dose. Less than 2% of parent drug was recovered in feces. Repaglinide appears to be a substrate for active hepatic uptake transporter (organic anion transporting protein OATP1B1).</p><p class="First">Repaglinide AUC after multiple doses of 0.25 mg to 4 mg with each meal varies over a wide range. The intra-individual and inter-individual coefficients of variation were 36% and 69%, respectively. AUC over the therapeutic dose range included 69 to 1005 ng/mL*hr, but AUC exposure up to 5417 ng/mL*hr was reached in dose escalation studies without apparent adverse consequences.</p><p class="First">Healthy volunteers were treated with a regimen of 2 mg Repaglinide Tablets taken before each of 3 meals. There were no significant differences in repaglinide pharmacokinetics between the group of patients &lt; 65 years of age and a comparably sized group of patients ≥ 65 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].</span></p><p class="First">A comparison of pharmacokinetics in males and females showed the AUC over the 0.5 mg to 4 mg dose range to be 15% to 70% higher in females with type 2 diabetes. This difference was not reflected in the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes (male: 16%; female: 17%) or other adverse events.</p><p class="First">No pharmacokinetic studies to assess the effects of race have been performed, but in a U.S. 1-year study in patients with type 2 diabetes, the blood glucose-lowering effect was comparable between Caucasians (n = 297) and African-Americans (n = 33). In a U.S. dose-response study, there was no apparent difference in exposure (AUC) between Caucasians (n = 74) and Hispanics (n = 33).</p><p class="First">Single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics of repaglinide were compared between patients with type 2 diabetes and normal renal function (CrCl &gt; 80 mL/min), mild to moderate renal function impairment (CrCl = 40 mL/min to 80 mL/min), and severe renal function impairment (CrCl = 20 mL/min to 40 mL/min). Both AUC and C <span class="Sub">max</span> of repaglinide were similar in patients with normal and mild to moderately impaired renal function (mean values 56.7 ng/mL*hr vs 57.2 ng/mL*hr and 37.5 ng/mL vs 37.7 ng/mL, respectively.) Patients with severely reduced renal function had elevated mean AUC and C <span class="Sub">max</span> values (98.0 ng/mL*hr and 50.7 ng/mL, respectively), but this study showed only a weak correlation between repaglinide levels and creatinine clearance.</p><p class="First">A single-dose, open-label study was conducted in 12 healthy subjects and 12 patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) classified by Child-Pugh scale and caffeine clearance. Patients with moderate to severe impairment of liver function had higher and more prolonged serum concentrations of both total and unbound repaglinide than healthy subjects (AUC <span class="Sub">healthy</span> : 91.6 ng/mL*hr; AUC <span class="Sub">CLD patients</span> : 368.9 ng/mL*hr; C <span class="Sub">max</span>, <span class="Sub">healthy</span> : 46.7 ng/mL; C <span class="Sub">max</span>, <span class="Sub">CLD patients</span> : 105.4 ng/mL). AUC was statistically correlated with caffeine clearance. No difference in glucose profiles was observed across patient groups.</p><p class="First">Drug interaction studies performed in healthy volunteers show that Repaglinide Tablets had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of digoxin, theophylline, or warfarin. Co-administration of cimetidine with Repaglinide Tablets did not significantly alter the absorption and disposition of repaglinide.</p><p>Additionally, the following drugs were studied in healthy volunteers with co-administration of Repaglinide Tablets.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study Drug</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dosing</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Repaglinide Dosing</span>*</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Repaglinide</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">AUC</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">C <span class="Sub">max</span></span></p><p class="First">Clarithromycin †</p><p class="First">250 mg BID for 4 days</p><p class="First">40% ↑</p><p class="First">67% ↑</p><p class="First">Clopidogrel †</p><p class="First">300 mg (Day 1)</p><p>75 mg QD (Day 2 to 3)</p><p class="First">0.25 mg</p><p>(Day 1 and 3)</p><p class="First">(day 1) 5.1 fold ↑</p><p>(3.9 to 6.6)</p><p>(day 3) 3.9 fold ↑</p><p>(2.9 to 5.3)</p><p class="First">2.5 fold ↑</p><p>(1.8 to 3.5)</p><p>2.0 fold ↑</p><p>(1.3 to 3.1)</p><p class="First">Cyclosporine</p><p class="First">100 mg</p><p>(2 doses 12 hours apart)</p><p class="First">2.5 fold ↑</p><p class="First">1.8 fold ↑</p><p class="First">Deferasirox †</p><p class="First">30 mg/kg QD</p><p>for 4 days</p><p class="First">0.5 mg</p><p class="First">2.3 fold ↑</p><p class="First">62% ↑</p><p class="First">Fenofibrate</p><p class="First">200 mg QD</p><p>for 5 days</p><p class="First">0%</p><p class="First">0%</p><p class="First">Gemfibrozil †</p><p class="First">600 mg BID</p><p>for 3 days</p><p class="First">8.1 fold ↑</p><p class="First">2.4 fold ↑</p><p class="First">Itraconazole †</p><p class="First">100 mg BID</p><p>for 3 days</p><p class="First">1.4 fold ↑</p><p class="First">1.5 fold ↑</p><p class="First">Gemfibrozil + Itraconazole †</p><p>Co-administration</p><p class="First">Gem: 600 mg BID</p><p>for 3 days</p><p>Itra: 100 mg BID</p><p>for 3 days</p><p class="First">19 fold ↑</p><p class="First">2.8 fold ↑</p><p class="First">Ketoconazole</p><p class="First">200 mg QD</p><p>for 4 days</p><p class="First">2 mg</p><p class="First">15% ↑</p><p class="First">16% ↑</p><p class="First">Levonorgestrel/ethinyl Estradiol</p><p class="First">(0.15 mg/0.03 mg)</p><p>Combination tablet QD for 21 days</p><p class="First">2 mg</p><p class="First">0%</p><p class="First">20% ↑</p><p class="First">Nifedipine †</p><p class="First">10 mg TID</p><p>for 4 days</p><p class="First">2 mg</p><p class="First">0%</p><p class="First">0%</p><p class="First">Rifampin †</p><p class="First">600 mg QD</p><p>for 6 to 7 days</p><p class="First">4 mg</p><p class="First">32% to 80% ↓</p><p class="First">17% to 79% ↓</p><p class="First">Simvastatin</p><p class="First">20 mg QD</p><p>for 4 days</p><p class="First">2 mg</p><p class="First">0%</p><p class="First">26% ↑</p><p class="First">Trimethoprim †</p><p class="First">160 mg BID</p><p>for 2 days</p><p>160 mg QD</p><p>for 1 day</p><p class="First">61% ↑</p><p class="First">41% ↑</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats at doses up to 120 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 60 times clinical exposure on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis, the incidences of benign adenomas of the thyroid and liver were increased in male rats.
