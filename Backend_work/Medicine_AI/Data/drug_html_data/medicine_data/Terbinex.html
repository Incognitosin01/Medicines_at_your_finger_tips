It may not be specific to Terbinex. Please read with care.</b></p><p><i>Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.</p><p>This medicine comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Terbinafine <i>tablets</i> may be taken with food or on an empty stomach. However, it is best to take terbinafine <i>oral granules</i> with food.</p><p>To help clear up your infection completely, it is very important that <i>you keep using this medicine for the full time of treatment</i>, even if your symptoms begin to clear up or you begin to feel better after a few days. Since fungal infections may be very slow to clear up, you may need to take this medicine for several weeks or months. If you stop taking this medicine too soon, your symptoms may return.</p><p>This medicine works best when there is a constant amount in the blood. To help keep the amount constant, do not miss any doses. Also, it is best to take the doses at the same times every day. If you need help in planning the best time to take your medicine, check with your doctor.</p><p>If you are using the <i>oral granules</i>, you may sprinkle the contents on a spoonful of pudding or other soft, non-acidic food such as mashed potatoes. This mixture must be swallowed immediately without chewing. Do not use applesauce or fruit-based foods. If you will need two packets of oral granules with each dose, you may sprinkle the content of both packets on one spoonful or two spoonfuls of non-acidic food.</p><p>Avoid caffeine (coffee, soda, chocolate) while you are using this medicine. Terbinafine may cause caffeine to stay in your body longer than usual.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
