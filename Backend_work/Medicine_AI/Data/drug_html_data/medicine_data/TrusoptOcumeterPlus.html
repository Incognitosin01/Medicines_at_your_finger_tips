Both eye conditions are caused by high pressure in your eye and can lead to pain from pressure in your eye and then can eventually harm your vision. This medicine can help you keep your sight by reducing the pressure in your eye and stopping eye pain.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Trusopt Ocumeter Plus</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of dorzolamide eye drops in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of dorzolamide eye drops in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding.

In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Trusopt Ocumeter Plus</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain dorzolamide.  It may not be specific to Trusopt Ocumeter Plus. Please read with care.</b></p><p>Your eye doctor will tell you how much of this medicine to use and how often. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.</p><p>This medicine should come with a patient instruction leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>If you normally wear soft contact lenses, remove them before you use dorzolamide eye drops. Wait at least for 15 minutes before putting the contact lenses back in.</p><p>To use the eye drops:</p><ul>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water.</li>
<li>Before using this medicine for the first time, make sure that the safety strip on the bottle is unbroken.</li>
<li>Tear off the safety strip to break the seal and open the bottle by unscrewing the cap by turning as indicated by the arrows on the top of the cap. Do not pull the cap directly up and away from the bottle.</li>
<li>Tilt your head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space.</li>
<li>Invert the bottle, and press lightly the "finger push area" using your thumb or index finger.</li>
<li>Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eye. Do not blink. Keep the eye closed for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to cover the eye.</li>
<li>If you think you did not get the drop of medicine into your eye properly, replace the cap on the bottle and tighten. Then, remove by turning the cap in the opposite direction as indicated by the arrows on the top of the cap and repeat the process with another drop.</li>
<li>Replace the cap by turning until it is firmly touching the bottle. Do not overtighten or you may damage the bottle and cap.</li>
<li>Wash your hands after using the eye drops to remove any medicine.</li>
<li>Never touch the applicator tip to any surface, including the eye, and keep the container tightly closed. This will keep the medicine as germ-free as possible.</li>
</ul><p>If your doctor ordered two different eye drops to be used together, wait at least 5 minutes between the times you apply the medicines. This will help to keep the second medicine from “washing out” the first one.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.
