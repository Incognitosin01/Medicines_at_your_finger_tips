Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill) that helps prevent your body from absorbing too much salt, which can cause fluid retention.</p><p>Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic that also prevents your body from absorbing too much salt and keeps your potassium levels from getting too low.</p><p>Dyazide is a prescription medicine used to treat fluid retention (edema) and high blood pressure (hypertension).</p><p>Dyazide is usually given to people in whom other diuretics have caused hypokalemia (low potassium levels in your blood).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Dyazide if have kidney disease, urination problems, high levels of potassium in your blood, or if you are taking other diuretics similar to triamterene. Do not use potassium supplements, salt substitutes, or low-sodium milk unless your doctor has told you to.</p><p>Dyazide can raise your blood potassium to dangerous levels, especially if you have kidney disease, diabetes, severe illness, or if you are an older adult. <b>Call your doctor right away if you have signs of high potassium:</b> nausea, slow or unusual heart rate, numbness, tingling, muscle weakness, or loss of movement in any part of your body.</p><p>Drinking alcohol can further lower your blood pressure and may increase certain side effects of Dyazide.</p><p>Avoid a diet high in salt. Too much salt will cause your body to retain water and can make this medication less effective.</p><p>Do not use potassium supplements, salt substitutes, or low-sodium milk while you are taking Dyazide, unless your doctor has told you to.</p><p>Avoid becoming overheated or dehydrated during exercise and in hot weather. Follow your doctor's instructions about the type and amount of liquids you should drink. In some cases, drinking too much liquid can be as unsafe as not drinking enough.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Dyazide if you are allergic to hydrochlorothiazide or triamterene, or if:</p><ul>
