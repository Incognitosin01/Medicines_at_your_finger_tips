While the exact mechanism has not been fully elucidated, specific immunotherapy (SIT) may act by inducing a switch from T helper 2 cell response (Th2) to T helper 1 cell (Th1) response resulting in decreased interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-5 (IL-5) and increased interleukin-10 (IL-10), production of IgG-blocking antibodies that compete with IgE antibodies for allergen binding, proliferation of regulatory T lymphocytes and cytokines, and decreases in mast cells, eosinophils, and early- and late-phase allergic responses (Leith, 2006). </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis:</b> Immunotherapy for the treatment of grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis confirmed by positive skin test or in vitro testing for pollen-specific IgE antibodies for any of the 5 grass species contained in this product in patients 5 to 65 years of age. Not indicated for the immediate relief of allergy symptoms.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to any of the inactive ingredients (mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, colloidal anhydrous silica, magnesium stearate and lactose monohydrate) contained in this product or any component of the formulation; severe, unstable or uncontrolled asthma; history of any severe systemic allergic reaction; history of any severe local reaction to sublingual allergen immunotherapy; history of eosinophilic esophagitis</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Additional contraindications (not in US labeling):  Immunotherapy is not indicated if a patient has not demonstrated symptoms, IgE antibodies, positive skin tests, or properly controlled challenge testing; concomitant therapy with beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors; severe and/or unstable asthma (FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;70% of predicted value); severe immune deficiency or autoimmune disease; any malignant disease (eg, cancer); oral inflammation (eg, oral lichen planus, oral ulcerations, or oral mycosis)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p>Dosage strength expressed in Index of Reactivity (IR). <b>Note:</b> Initiate treatment 4 months before expected onset of each grass pollen season and continue throughout pollen season. Safety of initiating treatment during grass pollen season or restarting treatment after missing a dose have not been established.</p><p><b>Grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis:</b> Sublingual: Adults ≤65 years: 300 IR once daily</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Dosage strength expressed in Index of Reactivity (IR). Initiate treatment 4 months before expected onset of each grass pollen season and continue throughout pollen season. Safety of initiating treatment during grass pollen season or restarting treatment after missing a dose have not been established.</p><p><b>Grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis:</b></p><p>Children ≥5 years and Adolescents ≤17 years: Sublingual: Initial: Day 1: 100 IR once daily; Day 2: 200 IR once daily; Maintenance (Day 3 and thereafter): 300 IR once daily</p><p>Adolescents ≥18 years: Sublingual: 300 IR once daily</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Sublingual: Administer first dose in a health care setting due to the potential for allergic reactions; monitor patient for 30 minutes after first dose. If well tolerated, subsequent doses may be taken at home. Remove sublingual tablet from blister immediately prior to administration. Place tablet(s) under tongue until completely dissolved (≥1 minute) and then swallow. Wash hands after handling tablet. Avoid food or beverage for 5 minutes following dissolution of tablet (to prevent the swallowing of allergen extract). Auto-injectable epinephrine should be made available to patients.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store between 20°C and 25°C (68°F and 77°F); excursions are permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F). Protect from moisture.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Grass Pollen Allergen Extract (5 Grass Extract). Specifically, ACE inhibitors may increase the risk of severe allergic reaction to Grass Pollen Allergen Extract (5 Grass Extract).<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Beta-Blockers: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Grass Pollen Allergen Extract (5 Grass Extract). More specifically, Beta-Blockers may inhibit the ability to effectively treat severe allergic reactions to Grass Pollen Allergen Extract (5 Grass Extract) with epinephrine.  Some other effects of epinephrine may be unaffected or even enhanced (e.g., vasoconstriction) during treatment with Beta-Blockers. Management: Consider alternatives to either grass pollen allergen extract (5 grass extract) or beta-blockers in patients with indications for both agents.  Canadian product labeling specifically lists this combination as contraindicated.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Frequency of adverse reactions similar in adult and pediatric patients, unless otherwise noted.</p><p>&gt;10%:</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Oral itching (25%)</p><p>Respiratory: Throat irritation (22%)</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Cardiovascular: Lip edema (4%)</p><p>Central nervous system: Oral paresthesia (4%), voice disorder (children and adolescents: 3%), oral hypoesthesia (2%)</p><p>Dermatologic: Pruritus of ear (8%), tongue pruritus (8%), atopic dermatitis (children and adolescents: 3%)</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain (4%), dyspepsia (4%), lip pruritus (children and adolescents: 3%), stomatitis (2%), dysphagia (&lt;2%), esophageal pain (&lt;2%), gastritis (&lt;2%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (&lt;2%), nausea (&lt;2%), vomiting (&lt;2%)</p><p>Hypersensitivity: Mouth edema (8%), tongue edema (3%)</p><p>Respiratory: Asthma (children and adolescents: 7%), cough (7%), tonsillitis (children and adolescents: 6%), oropharyngeal pain (5%), pharyngeal edema (4%), upper respiratory tract infection (children and adolescents: 4%)</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Allergic myocarditis, anaphylaxis, angioedema, anxiety, asthenia, chest discomfort, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, circulatory shock, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, dry eye syndrome, dyspnea, enlargement of salivary glands, eosinophilia, eosinophilic esophagitis, exacerbation of asthma, facial edema, flu-like symptoms, flushing, gastroenteritis, headache, hypersensitivity reaction, hypotension, laryngeal edema, local hypersensitivity reaction, loss of consciousness, lymphadenopathy, malaise, oropharyngeal blistering, pallor, palpitations, peripheral vascular disease, pruritus, sialorrhea, skin rash, stridor, tachycardia, tinnitus, weight loss, wheezing, xerostomia</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">ALERT: U.S. Boxed Warning</h2><p>Grass pollen allergen extract can cause life-threatening allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and severe laryngopharyngeal restriction.
