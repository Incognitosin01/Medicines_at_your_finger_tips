</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina</h3><p class="First">Rizatriptan benzoate should not be given to patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of rizatriptan benzoate. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists including rizatriptan benzoate may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.</p><p>Triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving rizatriptan benzoate. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span> For patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consideration should be given to administration of the first rizatriptan benzoate dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following rizatriptan benzoate administration. Periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered in intermittent long-term users of rizatriptan benzoate who have cardiovascular risk factors.</p><h3>Arrhythmias</h3><p class="First">Life threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists. Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate if these disturbances occur.</p><h3>Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure</h3><p class="First">As with other 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck and jaw commonly occur after treatment with rizatriptan benzoate and are usually non­-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists.</p><h3>Cerebrovascular Events</h3><p class="First">Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack). Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate if a cerebrovascular event occurs.</p><p>As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Other Vasospasm Reactions</h3><p class="First">5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional rizatriptan benzoate doses.</p><p>Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists have not been clearly established.</p><h3>Medication Overuse Headache</h3><p class="First">Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including rizatriptan benzoate particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.5)]</span>. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Rizatriptan benzoate treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Increase in Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension receiving 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate. In healthy young adult male and female patients who received maximal doses of rizatriptan benzoate (10 mg every 2 hours for three doses), slight increases in blood pressure (approximately 2 to 3 mmHg) were observed. Rizatriptan benzoate is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Adults</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials</span></p><p>Adverse reactions to rizatriptan benzoate were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included over 3,700 adult patients who received single or multiple doses of rizatriptan benzoate tablets. The most common adverse reactions during treatment with rizatriptan benzoate (≥5% in either treatment group and greater than placebo) were asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related.</p><p>Table 1 lists the adverse reactions (incidence ≥2% and greater than placebo) after a single dose of rizatriptan benzoate in adults.</p><p>The frequencies of adverse reactions in clinical trials did not increase when up to three doses were taken within 24 hours. Adverse reaction frequencies were also unchanged by concomitant use of drugs commonly taken for migraine prophylaxis (including propranolol), oral contraceptives, or analgesics. The incidences of adverse reactions were not affected by age or gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Other Events Observed in Association with the Administration of Rizatriptan Benzoate in Adults</span></p><p>In the following section, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse events are presented that were not reported in other sections of the labeling. Because the reports include events observed in open studies, the role of rizatriptan benzoate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used rizatriptan benzoate and reported an event divided by the total number of patients exposed to rizatriptan benzoate (N=3,716). All reported events occurred at an incidence ≥1%, or are believed to be reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those defined as those occurring in at least (&gt;)1/100 patients; infrequent adverse experiences are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; and rare adverse experiences are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.</p><p><span class="Italics">General:</span> Infrequent was facial edema. Rare were syncope and edema/swelling.</p><p><span class="Italics">Atypical Sensations:</span> Frequent were warm sensations.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> Frequent was palpitation.

Rare was erythema, hot flashes.</p><p>The adverse reaction profile seen with rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with rizatriptan benzoate tablets.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Pediatric Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Information relating to adverse reactions to rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) is approved for Merck &amp; Co., Inc.’s Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating Tablets.  However, due to Merck &amp; Co., Inc.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.</span></p><h3>Post-marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and which have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in other sections of the labeling or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide post-marketing experience, frequency of events and the role of rizatriptan benzoate in their causation cannot be reliably determined.</p><p><span class="Italics">Neurological/Psychiatric:</span> Seizure.</p><p><span class="Italics">General:</span> Allergic conditions including anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema, wheezing, and toxic epidermal necrolysis <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Special Senses:</span> Dysgeusia.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Propranolol</h3><p class="First">The dose of rizatriptan benzoate should be adjusted in propranolol-treated patients, as propranolol has been shown to increase the plasma AUC of rizatriptan by 70% <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Ergot-Containing Drugs</h3><p class="First">Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and rizatriptan benzoate within 24 hours is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Other 5-HT1 Agonists</h3><p class="First">Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of rizatriptan benzoate and other 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>SSRIs/SNRIs and Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</p><h3>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Rizatriptan benzoate is contraindicated in patients taking MAO-A inhibitors and non-selective MAO inhibitors. A specific MAO-A inhibitor increased the systemic exposure of rizatriptan and its metabolite <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Teratogenic Effects:</span> <span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category C</span></p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rizatriptan benzoate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>In a general reproductive study in rats, birth weights and pre- and post-weaning weight gain were reduced in the offspring of females treated prior to and during mating and throughout gestation and lactation with doses of 10 and 100 mg/kg/day. In a pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats, an increase in mortality of the offspring at birth and for the first three days after birth, a decrease in pre- and post-weaning weight gain, and decreased performance in a passive avoidance test (which indicates a decrease in learning capacity of the offspring) were observed at doses of 100 and 250 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose for all of these effects was 5 mg/kg/day, associated with a maternal plasma exposure (AUC) approximately 7.5 times that in humans receiving the MRDD. With doses of 100 and 250 mg/kg/day, the decreases in average weight of both the male and female offspring persisted into adulthood. All effects on the offspring in both studies occurred in the absence of any apparent maternal toxicity.</p><p>In embryofetal development studies, no teratogenic effects were observed when pregnant rats and rabbits were administered doses of 100 and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively, during organogenesis. Fetal weights were decreased in conjunction with decreased maternal weight gain at the highest doses tested. The developmental no-effect dose in these studies was 10 mg/kg/day in both rats and rabbits (maternal exposures approximately 15 times human exposure at the MRDD). Toxicokinetic studies demonstrated placental transfer of drug in both species.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when rizatriptan benzoate is administered to a nursing woman. Rizatriptan is extensively excreted in rat milk, with levels in milk at least 5-fold higher than levels in maternal plasma.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 6 years of age have not been established. <span class="Italics">Information related to the efficacy and safety of rizatriptan benzoate in the acute treatment of migraine in patients aged 6 to 17 years is approved for Merck &amp; Co., Inc.’s Rizatriptan Benzoate Tablets.</span>  However, due to Merck &amp; Co., Inc.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of rizatriptan benzoate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><p>Although the pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan were similar in elderly (aged ≥ 65 years) and in younger adults (n=17), in general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, starting at the low end of the dosing range. This reflects the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>Geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving rizatriptan benzoate <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">No overdoses of rizatriptan benzoate were reported during clinical trials in adults.</p><p>Some adult patients who received 40 mg of rizatriptan benzoate either a single dose or as two doses with a 2-hour interdose interval had dizziness and somnolence.</p><p>In a clinical pharmacology study in which 12 adult subjects received rizatriptan benzoate, at total cumulative doses of 80 mg (given within four hours), two of the subjects experienced syncope, dizziness, bradycardia including third degree AV block, vomiting, and/or incontinence.</p><p>In addition, based on the pharmacology of rizatriptan benzoate, hypertension or myocardial ischemia could occur after overdosage. Gastrointestinal decontamination, (i.e., gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal) should be considered in patients suspected of an overdose with rizatriptan benzoate. Clinical and electrocardiographic monitoring should be continued for at least 12 hours, even if clinical symptoms are not observed.</p><p>The effects of hemo- or peritoneal dialysis on serum concentrations of rizatriptan are unknown.</p><h2>Rizatriptan Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Rizatriptan benzoate tablets contain rizatriptan benzoate, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> (5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span>) receptor agonist. Rizatriptan benzoate is described chemically as: N,N-dimethyl-5-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1<span class="Italics">H</span>-­indole-3-ethanamine monobenzoate and its structural formula is:</p><p>Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">15</span>H<span class="Sub">19</span>N<span class="Sub">5</span>•C<span class="Sub">7</span>H<span class="Sub">6</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>, representing a molecular weight of the free base of 269.4. Rizatriptan benzoate is a white to off-white, crystalline solid that is soluble in water at about 42 mg per mL (expressed as free base) at 25°C.</p><p>Rizatriptan benzoate tablets are available for oral administration in strengths of 5 mg and 10 mg (corresponding to 7.265 mg or 14.53 mg of the benzoate salt, respectively). Each compressed tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, corn starch, magnesium stearate, and red iron oxide.</p><h2>Rizatriptan Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Rizatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptors. Rizatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache by binding to 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptors located on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>Rizatriptan is completely absorbed following oral administration. The mean oral absolute bioavailability of the rizatriptan benzoate tablet is about 45%, and mean peak plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) are reached in approximately 1 to 1.5 hours (T<span class="Sub">max</span>). The presence of a migraine headache did not appear to affect the absorption or pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of rizatriptan but delays the time to reach peak concentration by an hour. In clinical trials, rizatriptan benzoate was administered without regard to food.</p><p>The bioavailability and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of rizatriptan were similar following administration of rizatriptan benzoate tablets and rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets, but the rate of absorption is somewhat slower with rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets, with T<span class="Sub">max</span> delayed by up to 0.7 hour. AUC of rizatriptan is approximately 30% higher in females than in males. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>The mean volume of distribution is approximately 140 liters in male subjects and 110 liters in female subjects. Rizatriptan is minimally bound (14%) to plasma proteins.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>The primary route of rizatriptan metabolism is via oxidative deamination by monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) to the indole acetic acid metabolite, which is not active at the 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptor. N-monodesmethyl-rizatriptan, a metabolite with activity similar to that of parent compound at the 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptor, is formed to a minor degree. Plasma concentrations of N-monodesmethyl-rizatriptan are approximately 14% of those of parent compound, and it is eliminated at a similar rate.

In a drug interaction study, when rizatriptan 10 mg was administered to subjects (n=12) receiving concomitant therapy with the selective, reversible MAO-A inhibitor, moclobemide 150 mg t.i.d., there were mean increases in rizatriptan AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 119% and 41% respectively; and the AUC of the active N-monodesmethyl metabolite of rizatriptan was increased more than 400%.

Plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest dose tested were approximately 150 (mice) and 240 times (rats) that in humans at the maximum recommended daily dose (MRDD) of 30 mg/day. There was no evidence of an increase in tumor incidence related to rizatriptan in either species.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Mutagenesis</span>: Rizatriptan was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in a battery of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> genetic toxicity studies, including: the microbial mutagenesis (Ames) assay, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mammalian cell mutagenesis and chromosomal aberration assays, and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> chromosomal aberration assay in mouse.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Impairment of Fertility:</span> In a fertility study in rats, altered estrus cyclicity and delays in time to mating were observed in females treated orally with 100 mg/kg/day rizatriptan. The no-effect dose was 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 15 times the human exposure at the MRDD). There were no other fertility-related effects in the female rats. There was no impairment of fertility or reproductive performance in male rats treated with up to 250 mg/kg/day (approximately 550 times the human exposure at the MRDD).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Adults</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of rizatriptan benzoate tablets was established in four multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Patients enrolled in these studies were primarily female (84%) and Caucasian (88%), with a mean age of 40 years (range of 18 to 71). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction of moderate or severe headache pain to no or mild headache pain, was assessed for up to 2 hours (Study 1) or up to 4 hours after dosing (Studies 2, 3 and 4). Associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia and maintenance of response up to 24 hours post-dose were evaluated. A second dose of rizatriptan benzoate tablets was allowed 2 to 24 hours after dosing for treatment of recurrent headache in Studies 1 and 2. Additional analgesics and/or antiemetics were allowed 2 hours after initial treatment for rescue in all four studies.</p><p>In all studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater in patients who received either rizatriptan benzoate 5 mg or 10 mg compared to those who received placebo. In a separate study, doses of 2.5 mg were not different from placebo. Doses greater than 10 mg were associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects. The results from the four controlled studies are summarized in Table 2.</p><p>Comparisons of drug performance based upon results obtained in different clinical trials may not be reliable. Because studies are conducted at different times, with different samples of patients, by different investigators, employing different criteria and/or different interpretations of the same criteria, under different conditions (dose, dosing regimen, etc.), quantitative estimates of treatment response and the timing of response may be expected to vary considerably from study to study.</p><p>The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response within 2 hours following treatment in pooled Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4 is depicted in Figure 1.</p><p>For patients with migraine-associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at baseline, there was a decreased incidence of these symptoms following administration of rizatriptan benzoate compared to placebo.</p><p>Two to 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain response in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2.</p><p>Efficacy was unaffected by the presence of aura; by the gender, or age of the patient; or by concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants) or oral contraceptives. In two additional similar studies, efficacy was unaffected by relationship to menses. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy.</p><h3>Pediatric Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Information contained in a clinical study relating to the efficacy of rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) is approved for Merck &amp; Co., Inc.’s Rizatriptan Benzoate Tablets.
