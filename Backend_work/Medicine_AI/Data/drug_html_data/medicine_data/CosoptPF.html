Both eye conditions are caused by high pressure in your eye and can lead to pain from pressure in your eye and then can eventually harm your vision.

<li>The bottle is only partially full to provide proper drop control.</li>
<li>First, wash your hands with soap and water.</li>
<li>Before using this medicine for the first time, make sure that the safety strip on the bottle is unbroken.</li>
<li>Tear off the safety strip to break the seal and open the bottle by unscrewing the cap by turning as indicated by the arrows on the top of the cap. Do not pull the cap directly up and away from the bottle.</li>
<li>Tilt your head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space.</li>
<li>Invert the bottle, and press lightly the "finger push area" using your thumb or index finger.</li>
<li>Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Do not blink. Keep the eyes closed and apply pressure to the inner corner of the eye with your finger for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.</li>
<li>If you think you did not get the drop of medicine into your eye properly, replace the cap on the bottle and tighten. Then, remove by turning the cap in the opposite direction as indicated by the arrows on the top of the cap and repeat the process with another drop.</li>
<li>Replace the cap by turning until it is firmly touching the bottle. Do not overtighten or you may damage the bottle and cap.</li>
<li>Immediately after using the eye drops, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them.</li>
