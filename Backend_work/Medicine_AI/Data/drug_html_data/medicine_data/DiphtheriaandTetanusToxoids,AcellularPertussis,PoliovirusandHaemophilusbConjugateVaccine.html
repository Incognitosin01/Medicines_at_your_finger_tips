Children should also receive an additional dose of DTaP vaccine at 4 to 6 years of age; Daptacel or Quadracel is recommended for consistency of pertussis antigen between products.</p><p><i>Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations:</i></p><p>Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, acellular pertussis, poliovirus and <i>Haemophilus</i> b conjugate vaccine (Pentacel [DTaP-IPV/Hib]) may be used to provide the recommended DTaP, IPV, and Hib immunization series in infants and children &lt;5 years of age. The Hib component in Pentacel contains a tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T). A Hib vaccine containing the PRP-OMP conjugate (PedvaxHIB) may provide a more rapid seroconversion following the first dose and may be preferable to use in certain populations (eg, American Indian or Alaska Native children) (ACIP [Briere 2014]).</p><p>Per the ACIP, polio vaccine is recommended at 2, 4, and 6 to 18 months of age. For the 3-dose primary series, the minimum age and minimum intervals during the first 6 months of life should only be used when the vaccine recipient is at risk for imminent exposure to circulating poliovirus (shorter intervals and earlier start dates may lead to lower seroconversion) (CDC 2009). When Pentacel is administered according to labeled recommendations, this will result in a total of 5 childhood doses of IPV.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling</i>: Active immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, and invasive disease caused by <i>H. influenzae</i> type b; product specific labeling: Pediacel: Patients ≥2 months through 6 years of age; Infanrix-IPV/Hib: Patients ≥6 weeks through 4 years of age.</p><p><i>Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommendations: </i>Combination DTaP-IPV-Hib may be used to provide the component immunizations in children &lt;7 years of age (NACI 2016).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Severe allergic reaction to any vaccine containing diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis, poliovirus, or <i>Haemophilus</i> type b, or any component of this vaccine; encephalopathy (eg, coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) occurring within 7 days of a previous pertussis-containing vaccine (not attributable to another identifiable cause); progressive neurologic disorders (including infantile spasms, uncontrolled epilepsy, or progressive encephalopathy)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Note: Immunization during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: </b>Routine vaccination should NOT be delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic (CDC 2020; WHO 2020). In general, simultaneous administration of all vaccines for which a patient is eligible (according to current immunization schedules/guidelines) is recommended (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). However, outpatient visits solely for vaccination should be delayed in persons in quarantine due to close contact with COVID-19 or persons who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection (regardless of symptoms); refer to the CDC's "Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic" for current recommendations (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html).

Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever); vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia); bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; if the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM injection can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Guillain-Barré syndrome: Use with caution if Guillain-Barré syndrome occurred within 6 weeks of prior tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine (CDC/ACIP [Liang 2018]).</p><p>• Neurologic disorders: According to the manufacturer, use is contraindicated in patients with history of progressive neurologic disease including infantile spasms, uncontrolled seizure, or a progressive encephalopathy. ACIP guidelines recommend deferring immunization until health status can be assessed and condition stabilized (CDC/ACIP [Liang 2018]).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Consider deferring immunization during periods of severe immunosuppression (eg, patients receiving chemo/radiation therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy (including high-dose corticosteroids); may have a reduced response to vaccination. In general, household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive all age appropriate vaccines. Inactivated vaccines should be administered ≥2 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression when feasible; inactivated vaccines administered during chemotherapy should be readministered after immune competence is regained (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p>• Pediatric: If inadvertently administered to children ≥5 years as a booster dose, it may be counted as a valid dose (CDC 2008). Apnea has been reported following IM vaccine administration in premature infants; consider clinical status implications. In general, preterm infants should be vaccinated at the same chronological age as full-term infants (AAP [Saari 2003]; ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Anticoagulant therapy: Use with caution in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy; bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist. The use of combination vaccines is generally preferred over separate injections, taking into consideration provider assessment, patient preference, and potential adverse events. When using combination vaccines, the minimum age for administration is the oldest minimum age for any individual component; the minimum interval between dosing is the greatest minimum interval between any individual components. The ACIP prefers each dose of a specific vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer when possible; however, vaccination should not be deferred because a specific brand name is unavailable (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Aluminum: Product may contain aluminum.</p><p>• Neomycin: Product may contain neomycin.</p><p>• Polymyxin B: Product may contain polymyxin B.</p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Antipyretics: Per the manufacturer, antipyretic prophylaxis may be considered for patients at high risk for seizures. However, antipyretics have not been shown to prevent febrile seizures; antipyretics may be used to treat fever or discomfort following vaccination (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). One study reported that routine prophylactic administration of acetaminophen to prevent fever prior to vaccination decreased the immune response of some vaccines; the clinical significance of this reduction in immune response has not been established (Prymula 2009).</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor for hypersensitivity and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.</p><h2>More about diphtheria toxoid / haemophilus b conjugate (prp-t) vaccine / pertussis, acellular / poliovirus vaccine, inactivated / tetanus toxoid</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
