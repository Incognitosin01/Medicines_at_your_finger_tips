The medicine works by removing the extra uric acid from the body. Sulfinpyrazone does not cure gout, but after you have been taking it for a few months it may help prevent gout attacks. Sulfinpyrazone will help prevent gout attacks only as long as you continue to take it.</p><p>Sulfinpyrazone is sometimes used to prevent or treat other medical problems that may occur if too much uric acid is present in the body.</p><p>Sulfinpyrazone may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.</p><p>Sulfinpyrazone is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using sulfinpyrazone</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For sulfinpyrazone, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to sulfinpyrazone or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Studies on sulfinpyrazone have been done only in adult patients, and there is no specific information comparing use of sulfinpyrazone in children with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of sulfinpyrazone in the elderly with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking sulfinpyrazone, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using sulfinpyrazone with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of sulfinpyrazone. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Blood disease (or history of) or</li>
<li>Cancer being treated by antineoplastics (cancer medicine) or radiation (x-rays) or</li>
<li>Kidney stones (or history of) or other kidney disease or</li>
<li>Stomach ulcer or other stomach or intestinal problems (or history of)â€”The chance of serious side effects may be increased; also, sulfinpyrazone may not work properly for treating gout if some kinds of kidney disease are present</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of sulfinpyrazone</h2><p>If sulfinpyrazone upsets your stomach, it may be taken with food. If this does not work, an antacid may be taken. If stomach upset (nausea, vomiting, or stomach pain) continues, check with your doctor.</p><p>In order for sulfinpyrazone to help you, it must be taken regularly as ordered by your doctor.</p><p>When you first begin taking sulfinpyrazone, the amount of uric acid in the kidneys is greatly increased. This may cause kidney stones in some people. To help prevent this, your doctor may want you to drink at least 10 to 12 full glasses (8 ounces each) of fluids each day, or to take another medicine to make your urine less acid. It is important that you follow your doctor's instructions very carefully.</p><p>For patients taking sulfinpyrazone for gout:</p><ul>
<li>After you begin to take sulfinpyrazone, gout attacks may continue to occur for a while. However, if you take sulfinpyrazone regularly as directed by your doctor, the attacks will gradually become less frequent and less painful. After you have been taking sulfinpyrazone for several months, they may stop completely.</li>
<li>Sulfinpyrazone helps to prevent gout attacks. It will not relieve an attack that has already started. Even if you take another medicine for gout attacks, continue to take sulfinpyrazone also.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of sulfinpyrazone will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of sulfinpyrazone. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
<li>For treating gout or removing uric acid from the body:
<ul>
<li>Adults: The starting dose of sulfinpyrazone is usually 100 mg or 200 mg a day (one-half of a 100-mg tablet two times a day, one 100-mg tablet one or two times a day, or one 200-mg capsule or tablet once a day). Then, the dose is usually increased by 100 mg or 200 mg every few days, up to 800 mg a day. Starting with a low dose and increasing the dose gradually helps prevent kidney stones and other side effects. After a while, the dose may be changed again, depending on the amount of uric acid in your blood or urine.</li>
<li>Children: It is not likely that sulfinpyrazone will be needed to treat gout or remove uric acid from the body in children. However, if a child needs sulfinpyrazone, the dose would have to be determined by the doctor.</li>

The results of some tests may be affected by sulfinpyrazone.</p><p>For patients taking sulfinpyrazone for gout or to help remove uric acid from the body:</p><ul>
<li>Taking aspirin or other salicylates may lessen the effects of sulfinpyrazone. This will depend on the dose of aspirin or other salicylate that you take, and on how often you take it. Also, drinking too much alcohol may increase the amount of uric acid in the blood and lessen the effects of sulfinpyrazone. Therefore, do not take aspirin or other salicylates or drink alcoholic beverages while taking sulfinpyrazone, unless you have first checked with your doctor.</li>
