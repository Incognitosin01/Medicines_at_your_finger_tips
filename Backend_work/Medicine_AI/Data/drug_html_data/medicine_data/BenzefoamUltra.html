Benzoyl peroxide (C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">10</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>) is represented by the following structure:</p><p> </p><h2>Benzefoam Ultra - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The exact method of action of benzoyl peroxide in acne vulgaris is not known. Benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial agent with demonstrated activity against <span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes</span>. This action, combined with the mild keratolytic effect of benzoyl peroxide, is believed to be responsible for its usefulness in acne. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is metabolized to benzoic acid and excreted as benzoate in the urine.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Benzefoam Ultra</h2><p class="First">BenzEFoamUltra<span class="Sup">TM</span> Short Contact Foam is indicated for use in the topical treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">BenzEFoamUltra<span class="Sup">TM</span> Short Contact Foam should not be used in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to benzoyl peroxide or to any of the other ingredients in the product. Discontinue use if hypersensitivity is observed.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.</span> Not For Ophthalmic use. Keep out of the reach of children.</p><p><span class="Bold">When using this product, skin irritation and dryness is more likely to occur if:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">If irritation occurs:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Do not use if you:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">When using this product</span>:</p><p>• avoid unnecessary sun exposure and use a sunscreen</p><p>• avoid contact with the eyes, lips, and mouth</p><p>• <span class="Bold">avoid contact with hair and dyed fabrics, which may be bleached by this product</span></p><p>• skin irritation may occur, characterized by redness, burning, itching, peeling, or possibly swelling</p><p>Contents under pressure. Do not puncture or incinerate container. Do not expose to temperature above 120°F (49°C).</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> If severe irritation develops, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Information for Patients:</span> This medication is to be used as directed by a physician and should not be used to treat any condition other than that for which it was prescribed. Avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, lips, and mucous membranes. If accidental contact occurs, rinse with water. If excessive redness or irritation develops, discontinue use and consult your physician.</p><p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span> Based upon all available evidence, benzoyl peroxide is not considered to be a carcinogen. However, data from a study using mice known to be highly susceptible to cancer suggest that benzoyl peroxide acts as a tumor promoter. The clinical significance of the findings is not known.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy:</span> Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with benzoyl peroxide. It is also not known whether benzoyl peroxide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Benzoyl peroxide should be used by a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> It is not known whether this drug is excreted in the human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when benzoyl peroxide is administered to a nursing woman.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Allergic contact dermatitis and dryness have been reported with topical benzoyl peroxide therapy.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">If excessive scaling, erythema or edema occurs, the use of this preparation should be discontinued. To hasten resolution of the adverse effects, cool compresses may be used. After symptoms and signs subside, a reduced dosage schedule may be cautiously tried if the reaction is judged to be due to excessive use and not allergenicity.</p><h2>Benzefoam Ultra Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Prime Can Before Initial Use:</span> Gently push up on actuator with thumb until tab breaks. Shake can vigorously (until product moves inside can). Firmly strike bottom of can onto palm of other hand or a hard surface at least 3 times.
