This can slow bone loss and may help prevent bone fractures.</p><p>Zometa is used to treat high blood levels of calcium caused by cancer (also called hypercalcemia of malignancy). This medicine also treats multiple myeloma (a type of bone marrow cancer) or bone cancer that has spread from elsewhere in the body.</p><p>The Reclast brand of zoledronic acid is used in men and women to treat or prevent osteoporosis caused by menopause or by taking steroids. Reclast is also used to increase bone mass in men who have osteoporosis, and to treat Paget's disease of bone in men and women. You should not use Reclast and Zometa at the same time.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Zometa may harm an unborn baby.</b> Avoid getting pregnant while using this medicine and tell your doctor if you become pregnant.</p><p><b>Zometa can cause serious kidney problems,</b> especially if you are dehydrated, if you take diuretic medicine, or if you already have kidney disease. Call your doctor if you urinate less than usual, if you have swelling in your feet or ankles, or if you feel tired or short of breath.</p><p>Also call your doctor if you have muscle spasms, numbness or tingling (in hands and feet or around the mouth), new or unusual hip pain, or severe pain in your joints, bones, or muscles.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend you have a dental exam for preventive tooth and gum care before you start your treatment with Zometa. This is especially important if you have cancer, if you are undergoing chemotherapy or using steroids, or if you have poor dental health.</p><p>Some people using medicines similar to Zometa have developed bone loss in the jaw, also called osteonecrosis of the jaw. Symptoms of this condition may include jaw pain, swelling, numbness, loose teeth, gum infection, or slow healing after injury or surgery involving the gums. You may be more likely to develop osteonecrosis of the jaw if you have cancer or have been treated with chemotherapy, radiation, or steroids. Other conditions associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw include blood clotting disorders, anemia (low red blood cells), and pre-existing dental problems.</p><p>Avoid having any type of dental surgery while you are being treated with Zometa. It may take longer than normal for you to recover.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with Zometa if you are allergic to zoledronic acid.</p><p>You also should not receive <b>Reclast</b> if you have:</p><ul>
