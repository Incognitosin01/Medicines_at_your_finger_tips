</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination hormonal contraceptive (CHC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, CHCs, including Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring, should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke. <span class="Italics">[See Contraindications (4).]</span></span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Etonogestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Insert</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOR VAGINAL USE ONLY</span></p><p>Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is indicated for use by females of reproductive age to prevent pregnancy.</p><h2>Etonogestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Insert Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>How to Use Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring</h3><p class="First">To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring must be used as directed <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>. One Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is inserted in the vagina. <span class="Bold">The ring is to remain in place continuously for three weeks.</span> It is removed for a one-week break, during which a withdrawal bleed usually occurs. A new ring is inserted one week after the last ring was removed.</p><p>The user can choose the insertion position that is most comfortable to her, for example, standing with one leg up, squatting, or lying down. The ring is to be compressed and inserted into the vagina. The exact position of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring inside the vagina is not critical for its function. The vaginal ring must be inserted on the appropriate day and left in place for three consecutive weeks. This means that the ring should be removed three weeks later on the same day of the week as it was inserted and at about the same time.</p><p>Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring can be removed by hooking the index finger under the forward rim or by grasping the rim between the index and middle finger and pulling it out. The used ring should be placed in the sachet (foil pouch) and discarded in a waste receptacle out of the reach of children and pets (do not flush in toilet).</p><p>After a one-week break, during which a withdrawal bleed usually occurs, a new ring is inserted on the same day of the week as it was inserted in the previous cycle. The withdrawal bleed usually starts on Day 2-3 after removal of the ring and may not have finished before the next ring is inserted. In order to maintain contraceptive effectiveness, the new ring must be inserted exactly one week after the previous one was removed even if menstrual bleeding has not finished.</p><h3>How to Start Using Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">IMPORTANT: Consider the possibility of ovulation and conception prior to the first use of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">No Hormonal Contraceptive Use in the Preceding Cycle:</span></p><p>The woman should insert Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring on the first day of her menstrual bleeding. Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring may also be started on Days 2-5 of the woman's cycle, but in this case a barrier method, such as male condoms with spermicide, should be used for the first seven days of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring use in the first cycle.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Changing From a CHC:</span></p><p>The woman may switch from her previous CHC on any day, but at the latest on the day following the usual hormone-free interval, if she has been using her hormonal method consistently and correctly, or if it is reasonably certain that she is not pregnant.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Changing From a Progestin-Only Method (progestin-only pill [POP], Implant, or Injection or a Progestin-Releasing Intrauterine System [IUS]):</span></p><p>The woman may switch from the POP on any day; instruct her to start using Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring on the day after she took her last POP. She should switch from an implant or the IUS on the day of its removal, and from an injectable on the day when the next injection would be due. In all of these cases, the woman should use an additional barrier method such as a male condom with spermicide, for the first seven days.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Use After Abortion or Miscarriage:</span></p><p>The woman may start using Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring within the first five days following a complete first trimester abortion or miscarriage, and she does not need to use an additional method of contraception. If use of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is not started within five days following a first trimester abortion or miscarriage, the woman should follow the instructions for "No Hormonal Contraceptive Use in the Preceding Cycle." In the meantime, she should be advised to use a non-hormonal contraceptive method.</p><p>Start Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring no earlier than four weeks after a second trimester abortion or miscarriage, due to the increased risk of thromboembolism. <span class="Italics">[See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>.<span class="Italics">]</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Following Childbirth:</span></p><p>The use of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring may be initiated no sooner than four weeks postpartum in women who elect not to breastfeed, due to the increased risk of thromboembolism in the postpartum period. <span class="Italics">[See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>.<span class="Italics">]</span></p><p>Advise women who are breastfeeding not to use Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring but to use other forms of contraception until the child is weaned.</p><p>If a woman begins using Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring postpartum, instruct her to use an additional method of contraception, such as male condoms with spermicide, for the first seven days. If she has not yet had a period, consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to initiation of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring.</p><h3>Deviations from the Recommended Regimen</h3><p class="First">To prevent loss of contraceptive efficacy, advise women not to deviate from the recommended regimen. Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring should be left in the vagina for a continuous period of three weeks. Advise women to regularly check for the presence of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring in the vagina (for example, before and after intercourse).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Inadvertent Removal or Expulsion</span></p><p>Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring can be accidentally expelled, for example, while removing a tampon, during intercourse, or with straining during a bowel movement. Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring should be left in the vagina for a continuous period of three weeks. If the ring is accidentally expelled and is left outside of the vagina for <span class="Bold">less than three hours</span>, contraceptive efficacy is not reduced. Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring can be rinsed with cool to lukewarm (not hot) water and <span class="Bold">reinserted as soon as possible,</span> but at the latest within three hours. If Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is lost, a new vaginal ring should be inserted and the regimen should be continued without alteration.</p><p>If Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is out of the vagina <span class="Bold">for more than three continuous hours:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">During Weeks 1 and 2:</span> Contraceptive efficacy may be reduced. The woman should reinsert the ring as soon as she remembers. A barrier method such as male condoms with spermicides must be used until the ring has been used continuously for seven days.</p><p><span class="Bold">During Week 3:</span> The woman should discard that ring. One of the following two options should be chosen:</p><p>In either case, a barrier method such as male condoms with spermicides must be used until the new ring has been used continuously for seven days.</p><p>If Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring was out of the vagina for an unknown amount of time, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered. A pregnancy test should be performed prior to inserting a new ring.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Prolonged Ring-Free Interval</span></p><p>If the ring-free interval has been extended beyond one week, consider the possibility of pregnancy, and an additional method of contraception, such as male condoms with spermicide, <span class="Bold">MUST</span> be used until Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring has been used <span class="Bold">continuously for seven days.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Prolonged Use of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring</span></p><p>If Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring has been left in place for up to one extra week (i.e., up to four weeks total), the woman will remain protected. Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring should be removed and the woman should insert a new ring after a one-week ring-free interval.</p><p>If Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring has been left in place for longer than four weeks, instruct the woman to remove the ring, and rule out pregnancy. If pregnancy is ruled out, Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring may be restarted, and an additional method of contraception, such as male condoms with spermicide, <span class="Bold">MUST</span> be used until a new Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring has been used <span class="Bold">continuously for seven days.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ring Breakage</span></p><p>There have been reported cases of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring disconnecting at the weld joint. This is not expected to affect the contraceptive effectiveness of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring. In the event of a disconnected ring, vaginal discomfort or expulsion (slipping out) is more likely to occur. Vaginal injury associated with ring breakage has been reported <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><p>If a woman discovers that her Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring has disconnected, she should discard the ring and replace it with a new ring.</p><h3>In the Event of a Missed Menstrual Period</h3><h3>Use with Other Vaginal Products</h3><p class="First">Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring may interfere with the correct placement and position of certain female barrier methods such as a diaphragm, cervical cap or female condom. These methods are not recommended as back-up methods with Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring use.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic data show that the use of tampons has no effect on the systemic absorption of the hormones released by Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is a non-biodegradable, flexible, transparent, colorless to almost colorless, combination contraceptive vaginal ring, with an outer diameter of 54 mm and a cross-sectional diameter of 4 mm. It is made of ethylene vinylacetate copolymers and magnesium stearate, and contains 11.7 mg etonogestrel and 2.7 mg ethinyl estradiol. When placed in the vagina, each ring releases on average 0.120 mg/day of etonogestrel and 0.015 mg/day of ethinyl estradiol over a three-week period of use. Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is not made with natural rubber latex.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Do not prescribe Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring to women who are known to have or use the following:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems</h3><p class="First">Stop Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring use if an arterial thrombotic or venous thromboembolic event (VTE) occurs. Stop Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring use if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. <span class="Italics">[See Adverse Reactions (6).]</span></p><p>If feasible, stop Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring at least four weeks before and through two weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism, and during and following prolonged immobilization.</p><p>Start Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.</p><p>The use of CHCs increases the risk of VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of CHCs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><p>Two epidemiologic studies<span class="Sup">1, 2, 3</span> that assessed the risk of VTE associated with the use of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring are described below.</p><p>In these studies, which were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies, Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring users had a risk of VTE similar to Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs) users (see Table 1 for adjusted hazard ratios). A large prospective, observational study, the Transatlantic Active Surveillance on Cardiovascular Safety of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring (TASC), investigated the risk of VTE for new users, and women who were switching to or restarting Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring or COCs in a population that is representative of routine clinical users. The women were followed for 24 to 48 months. The results showed a similar risk of VTE among Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring users (VTE incidence 8.3 per 10,000 WY) and women using COCs (VTE incidence 9.2 per 10,000 WY). For women using COCs that did not contain the progestins desogestrel (DSG) or gestodene (GSD), VTE incidence was 8.9 per 10,000 WY.</p><p>A retrospective cohort study using data from 4 health plans in the US (FDA-funded Study in Kaiser Permanente and Medicaid databases) showed the VTE incidence for new users of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring to be 11.4 events per 10,000 WY, for new users of a levonorgestrel (LNG)-containing COC 9.2 events per 10,000 WY, and for users of other COCs available during the course of the study1 8.2 events per 10,000 WY.</p><p>An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of CHCs is well-established. Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of CHCs compared to non-users, the rates associated with pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 1).</p><p>The frequency of VTE in women using CHCs has been estimated to be 3 to 12 cases per 10,000 women-years.</p><p>The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of CHC use and after restarting a CHC following a break of at least four weeks. The risk of VTE due to CHCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued.</p><p>Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs, for women who use CHCs, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE.</p><p>Several epidemiology studies indicate that third generation oral contraceptives, including those containing desogestrel (etonogestrel, the progestin in Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring, is the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel), may be associated with a higher risk of VTE than oral contraceptives containing other progestins. Some of these studies indicate an approximate two-fold increased risk. However, data from other studies have not shown this two-fold increase in risk.</p><p>Use of CHCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. CHCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). In general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt;35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke.</p><p>Use Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.</p><h3>Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)</h3><p class="First">Cases of TSS have been reported by Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring users. TSS has been associated with tampons and certain barrier contraceptives, and, in some cases the Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring users were also using tampons. A causal relationship between the use of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring and TSS has not been established. If a patient exhibits signs or symptoms of TSS, consider the possibility of this diagnosis and initiate appropriate medical evaluation and treatment.</p><h3>Liver Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Impaired Liver Function</span></p><p>Do not use Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring in women with liver disease such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of CHC use until markers of liver function return to normal and CHC causation has been excluded <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>. Discontinue Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring use if jaundice develops.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Liver Tumors</span></p><p>Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span> Hepatic adenomas are associated with CHC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 CHC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long term (&gt;8 years) CHC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in CHC users is less than one case per million users.</p><h3>Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment</h3><p class="First">During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with and without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as CHCs. Discontinue Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.</p><h3>High Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span> For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring use if blood pressure rises significantly.</p><p>An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women using CHCs and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions of anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported during use of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring. If anaphylaxis and/or angioedema is suspected, Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring should be discontinued and appropriate treatment administered. <span class="Italics">[See Contraindications (4).]</span></p><h3>Vaginal Use</h3><p class="First">Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring may not be suitable for women with conditions that make the vagina more susceptible to vaginal irritation or ulceration. Vaginal/cervical erosion or ulceration in women using Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring has been reported. In some cases, the ring adhered to vaginal tissue, necessitating removal by a healthcare provider and in some instances (i.e., when the tissue had grown over the ring), removal was achieved by cutting the ring without incising the overlying vaginal tissue.</p><p>Some women are aware of the ring on occasion during the 21 days of use or during intercourse, and sexual partners may feel Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring in the vagina.</p><h3>Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among CHC users. Use of CHCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease.</p><p>A past history of CHC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent CHC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for CHC-related cholestasis.</p><h3>Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</h3><p class="First">Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are using Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring. CHCs may decrease glucose tolerance.</p><p>Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. Some women will have adverse lipid changes while on CHCs.</p><p>Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using CHCs.</p><h3>Headache</h3><p class="First">If a woman using Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring if indicated.</p><p>Consider discontinuation of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring in the case of an increased frequency or severity of migraine during CHC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting</span></p><p>Unscheduled bleeding (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using CHCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different CHC.</p><p>Bleeding patterns were evaluated in three large clinical studies. In the North American study (US and Canada, N=1,177), the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 7.2% to 11.7% during cycles 1-13. In the two non-US studies, the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 2.6% to 6.4% (Europe, N=1,145) and from 2.0% to 8.7% (Europe, Brazil, Chile, N=512).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea</span></p><p>If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures.</p><p>Occasional missed periods may occur with the appropriate use of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring. In the clinical studies, the percent of women who did not have withdrawal bleeding in a given cycle ranged from 0.3% to 3.8%.</p><p>If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.</p><p>Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuing CHC use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</p><h3>Inadvertent Urinary Bladder Insertion</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of inadvertent insertions of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring into the urinary bladder, which required cystoscopic removal. Assess for ring insertion into the urinary bladder in Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring users who present with persistent urinary symptoms and are unable to locate the ring.</p><h3>Depression</h3><p class="First">Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring use if depression recurs to a serious degree.</p><h3>Carcinoma of the Breasts and Cervix</h3><p class="First">Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p>There is substantial evidence that CHCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that CHCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.</p><p>Some studies suggest that CHCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</p><h3>Effect on Binding Globulins</h3><p class="First">The estrogen component of CHCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin.

These changes may be clinically relevant in some cases.</p><h3>Effects of CHCs on Other Drugs</h3><p class="First">CHCs containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. CHCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid and temazepam. A significant decrease in the plasma concentrations of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.</p><p>Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of CHCs.</p><h3>Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy – Liver Enzyme Elevation</h3><p class="First">Do not co-administer Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is contraindicated during pregnancy because there is no need for pregnancy prevention in a woman who is already pregnant.

Harmful effects have not been observed in breastfed infants exposed to CHCs through breast milk. CHCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well-established; however, it can occur at any time in some women.</p><p>When possible, advise the nursing mother to use non-estrogen-containing contraception until she has completely weaned her child. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring have been established in women of reproductive age.

Overdosage may cause withdrawal bleeding in females and nausea. If the ring breaks, it does not release a higher dose of hormones. In case of suspected overdose, all Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring rings should be removed and symptomatic treatment given.</p><h2>Etonogestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Insert Description</h2><p class="First">Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is a non-biodegradable, flexible, transparent, colorless to almost colorless, combination contraceptive vaginal ring containing two active components, a progestin, etonogestrel (13-ethyl-17-hydroxy-11-methylene-18,19-dinor-17α-pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one) and an estrogen, ethinyl estradiol (19-nor-17α-pregna-1,3,5(10)-trien-20-yne-3,17-diol). When placed in the vagina, each ring releases on average 0.120 mg/day of etonogestrel and 0.015 mg/day of ethinyl estradiol over a three-week period of use. Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is made of ethylene vinylacetate copolymers (28% and 9% vinylacetate) and magnesium stearate and contains 11.7 mg etonogestrel and 2.7 mg ethinyl estradiol. Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is not made with natural rubber latex. Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring has an outer diameter of 54 mm and a cross-sectional diameter of 4 mm. The molecular weights for etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol are 324.46 and 296.40, respectively.</p><p>The structural formulas are as follows:</p><h2>Etonogestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Insert - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Combination hormonal contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins.

You should stop using Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring at least 4 weeks before you have surgery and not restart it until at least 2 weeks after your surgery.</li>
<li>are scheduled for any laboratory tests. Certain blood tests may be affected by hormonal birth control methods.</li>
<li>are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Hormonal birth control methods that contain estrogen, like Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring, may decrease the amount of milk you make. A small amount of hormones from Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring may pass into your breast milk. Consider another non-hormonal method of birth control until you are ready to stop breastfeeding.</li>
<li>have (or have ever had) an allergic reaction while using Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring, including hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and/or throat causing difficulty in breathing or swallowing (anaphylaxis and/or angioedema).</li>

</ul><p>Use an additional barrier contraceptive method (such as a male condom with spermicide) when you take medicines that may make Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring less effective. Since the effect of another medicine on Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring may last up to 28 days after stopping the medicine, it is necessary to use the additional barrier contraceptive method for that long to help prevent you from becoming pregnant. While using Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring, you should not use certain female barrier contraceptive methods such as a vaginal diaphragm, cervical cap or female condom as your back-up method of birth control because Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring may interfere with the correct placement and position of a diaphragm, cervical cap or female condom.</p><p>Some medicines and grapefruit juice may increase the level of ethinyl estradiol in your blood if used together, including:</p><ul class="Disc">

<li>ascorbic acid (vitamin C)</li>
<li>medicines that affect how your liver breaks down other medicines (such as itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, and diltiazem)</li>
<li>certain HIV medicines (atazanavir/ritonavir and indinavir)</li>
<li>non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (such as etravirine)</li>
<li>medicines to lower cholesterol such as atorvastatin and rosuvastatin</li>

<li>Read the <span class="Bold">Instructions for Use</span> at the end of this Patient Information that comes with your Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring for information about the right way to use Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring.</li>
<li>Use Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it.</li>
<li>Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is used in a 4-week cycle.
<ul class="Circle">
<li>Insert 1 Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring in the vagina and keep it in place for 3 weeks (21 days). Regularly check that Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring is in your vagina (for example, before and after intercourse) to ensure that you are protected from pregnancy.</li>
<li>Remove the Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring for a 1-week break (7 days). During the 1-week break (7 days), you will usually have your menstrual period.<br/>
Note: Insert and remove Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring on the same day of the week and at the same time:
<ul class="Circle">
<li>For example, if you insert your Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring on a Monday at 8:00 am, you should remove it on the Monday 3 weeks later at 8:00 am.</li>
<li>After your 1-week (7 days) break, you should insert a new Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring on the next Monday at 8:00 am.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While using Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring, you should not use certain female barrier contraceptive methods such as a vaginal diaphragm, cervical cap or female condom as your back-up method of birth control because Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring may interfere with the correct placement and position of a diaphragm, cervical cap or female condom.</li>
<li>Ring breakage has occurred when also using a vaginal product such as a lubricant or treatment for infection (see "What should I do if my NuvaRing comes out of my vagina?"). Use of spermicides or vaginal yeast products will not make Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring less effective at preventing pregnancy.</li>
<li>Use of tampons will not make Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring less effective or stop Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring from working.</li>
<li>If Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring has been left inside your vagina for more than 4 weeks (28 days), you may not be protected from pregnancy and you should see your healthcare provider to be sure you are not pregnant. Until you know the results of your pregnancy test, you should use an extra method of birth control, such as male condoms with spermicide, until the new Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring has been in place for 7 days in a row.</li>
<li>Do not use more than 1 Etonogestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring at a time. Too much hormonal birth control medicine in your body may cause nausea, vomiting, or vaginal bleeding.</li>
