This medicine is acidic and can interfere with unwanted bacteria in the urinary tract. This medicine is also believed to act as a diuretic ("water pill").</p><p>TheraCran HP (as juice or in capsules) has been used in alternative medicine as a possibly effective aid in preventing symptoms such as pain or burning with urination. This medicine will not treat the bacteria that causes a bladder infection.</p><p>Other uses not proven with research have included: urination problems caused by an enlarged prostate; reducing urine odor to improve quality of life in people with urinary incontinence; or healing the skin around the opening of a urostomy (a surgical opening formed to direct urine away from the bladder).</p><p>It is not certain whether TheraCran HP is effective in treating any medical condition. Medicinal use of this product has not been approved by the FDA. This medicine should not be used in place of medication prescribed for you by your doctor.</p><p>TheraCran HP is often sold as an herbal supplement. There are no regulated manufacturing standards in place for many herbal compounds and some marketed supplements have been found to be contaminated with toxic metals or other drugs. Herbal/health supplements should be purchased from a reliable source to minimize the risk of contamination.</p><p>TheraCran HP may also be used for purposes not listed in this product guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Follow all directions on the product label and package.
