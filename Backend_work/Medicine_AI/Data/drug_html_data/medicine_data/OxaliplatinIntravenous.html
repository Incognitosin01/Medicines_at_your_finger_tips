It is also used to treat severe colon cancer in patients who have had a surgery.</p><p>Oxaliplatin is an antineoplastic agent (cancer medicine). It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body.</p><p>Oxaliplatin is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using oxaliplatin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For oxaliplatin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to oxaliplatin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of oxaliplatin injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of oxaliplatin injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, diarrhea, dehydration, low potassium in the blood, unusual tiredness or weakness) to oxaliplatin.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving oxaliplatin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using oxaliplatin with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of oxaliplatin</h2><p>Medicines used to treat cancer are very strong and can have many side effects. Before receiving oxaliplatin, make sure you understand all the risks and benefits. It is important for you to work closely with your doctor during your treatment.</p><p>You will receive oxaliplatin while you are in a medical facility. A doctor or other trained health professional will give you oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. Oxaliplatin must be given slowly, so the needle will have to stay in place for at least 2 hours.</p><p>Oxaliplatin comes with a patient information leaflet. It is very important that you read and understand this information. Be sure to ask your doctor about anything you do not understand.</p><p>If any of oxaliplatin gets on your skin or in your eyes, nose, or mouth, tell your doctor or nurse right away.</p><p>Oxaliplatin is usually used with other medicines to treat cancer. This combination of medicines is usually given for 2 days, but you will receive oxaliplatin on the first day only (day 1). This 2-day treatment is given again every 2 weeks until your body responds to the medicine.</p><p>Oxaliplatin often causes nausea and vomiting. However, it is very important that you continue to receive oxaliplatin even if you begin to feel ill. Other medicines may be given to you to help with the nausea and vomiting. Ask your doctor for other ways to lessen these effects.</p><p>Avoid cold drinks, and the use of ice cubes in drinks. Avoid cold temperatures and cold objects. Cover your skin if you must go outside in cold temperatures. Do not put ice or ice packs on your body. Do not breathe deeply when exposed to cold air. Do not take things from the freezer or refrigerator without wearing gloves. Do not run the air conditioner at high levels in the house or in the car in hot weather.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using oxaliplatin</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that oxaliplatin is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Receiving oxaliplatin while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Female patients should use an effective form of birth control during treatment and for at least 9 months after the last dose. Male patients who have female partners should use effective birth control during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose. If you think a pregnancy has occurred while receiving oxaliplatin, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Oxaliplatin may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, diarrhea, a fever or chills, hives, hoarseness, itching, lightheadedness or dizziness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after you receive the medicine.</p><p>Oxaliplatin can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor right away if you start to cough up blood or if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>Tell your doctor right away if you have seizures, headache, confusion, vision problems, unusual drowsiness, tiredness, or weakness. These could be symptoms of a serious nervous system problem, called posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you start having cough, fever, or any problems with breathing. These may be signs of a serious lung disease.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you are having burning, numbness, tingling, or painful sensations in the arms, hands, legs, or feet. These could be symptoms of a condition called peripheral sensory neuropathy.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, unusual tiredness or weakness, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.</p><p>Contact your doctor right away if you have any changes to your heart rhythm. You might feel dizzy or faint, or you might have a fast, pounding, or uneven heartbeat. Make sure your doctor knows if you or anyone in your family has ever had a heart rhythm problem such as QT prolongation.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have dark urine, fever, muscle cramps or spasms, muscle pain or stiffness, or unusual tiredness or weakness. These could be symptoms of a serious muscle problem called rhabdomyolysis, which can cause kidney problems.</p><p>Oxaliplatin may cause dizziness, blurred vision, or other vision problems. If any of these occur, <i>do not drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not able to see well</i>. If these reactions are especially bothersome, check with your doctor.</p><p>Talk with your doctor before using oxaliplatin if you plan to have children. Some men and women who use oxaliplatin have become infertile (unable to have children).</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Oxaliplatin side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
