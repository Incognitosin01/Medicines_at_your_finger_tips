</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Uceris Foam</h2><p class="First">UCERIS rectal foam is indicated for the induction of remission in patients with active mild to moderate distal ulcerative colitis extending up to 40 cm from the anal verge.</p><h2>Uceris Foam Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage regimen is 1 metered dose administered rectally twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1 metered dose administered rectally once daily for 4 weeks.</p><h3>Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Advise patients:</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">UCERIS rectal foam is formulated as an emulsion which is filled into an aluminum canister with an aerosol propellant. It is available in 1 strength: 2 mg budesonide per metered dose.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">UCERIS rectal foam is contraindicated in patients with a history of a known hypersensitivity to budesonide or any of the ingredients of UCERIS rectal foam. Reactions have included anaphylaxis <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypercorticism and Adrenal Axis Suppression</h3><p class="First">When glucocorticosteroids are used chronically, systemic effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur. Glucocorticosteroids can reduce the response of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to stress. In situations where patients are subject to surgery or other stress situations, supplementation with a systemic glucocorticosteroid is recommended. Since UCERIS rectal foam contains a glucocorticosteroid, general warnings concerning glucocorticoids should be followed <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><p>Reduced liver function affects the elimination of glucocorticosteroids, and increased systemic availability of oral budesonide has been demonstrated in patients with liver cirrhosis <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Impaired Adrenal Suppression in Patients Transferred from Other Glucocorticoids</h3><p class="First">Monitor patients who are transferred from glucocorticosteroid treatment with higher systemic effects to glucocorticosteroids with lower systemic effects, such as UCERIS rectal foam, since symptoms attributed to withdrawal of steroid therapy, including those of acute adrenal suppression or benign intracranial hypertension, may develop. Adrenocortical function monitoring may be required in these patients and the dose of glucocorticosteroid treatment with high systemic effects should be reduced cautiously.</p><p>Replacement of systemic glucocorticosteroids with UCERIS rectal foam may unmask allergies (e.g., rhinitis and eczema), which were previously controlled by the systemic drug.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Infection</h3><p class="First">Patients who are on drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible patients or patients on immunosuppressant doses of glucocorticosteroids. In patients who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure.</p><p>How the dose, route and duration of glucocorticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior glucocorticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated (see prescribing information for VZIG and IG). If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</p><p>Glucocorticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infection, untreated fungal, bacterial, systemic viral or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex.</p><h3>Other Glucocorticosteroid Effects</h3><p class="First">Monitor patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, glaucoma or cataracts, or with a family history of diabetes or glaucoma, or with any other condition where glucocorticosteroids may have unwanted effects.</p><h3>Flammable Contents</h3><p class="First">The contents of UCERIS rectal foam include n-butane, isobutane and propane as propellants which are flammable. Instruct the patient to avoid fire, flame, and smoking during and immediately following administration. Patients should temporarily discontinue use of UCERIS rectal foam before initiation of bowel preparation for colonoscopy and consult their healthcare provider before resuming therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Serious and important adverse reactions include:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to UCERIS rectal foam in 332 patients with active mild to moderate distal ulcerative colitis extending up to 40 cm from the anal verge. The median duration of exposure was 42 days. This included 14 patients exposed for at least 6 months.</p><p>UCERIS rectal foam was studied primarily in 2 placebo-controlled, 6-week trials in patients with active disease (Study 1 and Study 2). In these trials, 268 patients received UCERIS rectal foam 2 mg twice a day for 2 weeks followed by 2 mg once a day for 4 weeks <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of the UCERIS rectal foam or Placebo group and at higher frequency in the UCERIS rectal foam group) were decreased blood cortisol, adrenal insufficiency, and nausea (Table 1). Decreased blood cortisol was defined as a morning cortisol level of &lt;5 mcg/dL. Adrenal insufficiency was defined as a cortisol level of &lt;18 mcg/dL at 30 minutes post-challenge with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).</p><p>A total of 10% of UCERIS rectal foam-treated patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction compared with 4% of placebo-treated patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reaction</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">UCERIS Rectal Foam</span><br/>

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiac disorders:</span> hypertension</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal disorders:</span> pancreatitis</p><p><span class="Italics">General disorders and administration site conditions:</span> pyrexia, peripheral edema</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune system disorders: anaphylactic reactions</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous system disorders:</span> dizziness, benign intracranial hypertension</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric disorders:</span> mood swings</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:</span> pruritus, maculopapular rash, allergic dermatitis</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>CYP3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">The active ingredient of UCERIS rectal foam, budesonide, is metabolized by CYP3A4. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, cyclosporine and grapefruit juice) can increase systemic budesonide concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors with UCERIS rectal foam <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category C</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no adequate and well controlled studies with UCERIS rectal foam in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have been conducted with budesonide. In these studies, subcutaneous administration of budesonide to rats and rabbits at doses 1.2 times and 0.12 times, respectively, the human intrarectal dose of 4 mg/day, produced skeletal abnormalities, fetal loss and decreased pup weight. UCERIS rectal foam should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. All pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2 to 4 percent for major malformations, and 15 to 20 percent for pregnancy loss.</p><p><span class="Italics">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Hypoadrenalism may occur in neonates exposed to glucocorticosteroids in utero. Carefully observe these neonates for signs and symptoms of hypoadrenalism.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Budesonide is teratogenic and embryocidal in rabbits and rats. In subcutaneous embryofetal development studies, fetal loss, decreased pup weights, and skeletal abnormalities were observed at a subcutaneous dose of 25 mcg/kg in rabbits (approximately 0.12 times the recommended human intrarectal dose of 4 mg/day, based on the body surface area) and 500 mcg/kg in rats (approximately 1.2 times the recommended human intrarectal dose of 4 mg/day, based on the body surface area).</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Use of UCERIS rectal foam is likely to result in budesonide in human milk as budesonide delivered by inhalation from a dry powder inhaler is present in human milk at low concentrations. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for UCERIS rectal foam and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from UCERIS rectal foam or from the underlying maternal condition. Exercise caution when administering UCERIS rectal foam to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of UCERIS rectal foam has not been established in pediatric patients.</p><p>Children who are treated with corticosteroids by any route may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with corticosteroid treatment, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in children than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of children treated with corticosteroids by any route should be monitored (e.g., via stadiometry), and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of other treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, children should be titrated to the lowest effective dose.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies with UCERIS rectal foam did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment. Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) should be monitored for increased signs and/or symptoms of hypercorticism. Discontinuing the use of UCERIS rectal foam should be considered in these patients if signs of hypercorticism are observed <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Acute overdosage with UCERIS rectal foam is unlikely. However, UCERIS rectal foam is absorbed systemically and chronic overdosage may result in signs/symptoms of hypercorticism <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Uceris Foam Description</h2><p class="First">UCERIS rectal foam contains budesonide, a non-halogenated synthetic glucocorticoid, as the active ingredient. It is a mixture of the 2 epimers (22R and 22S) differing in the position of an acetal chain. Both epimers are active glucocorticoids applied in a mixture of approximately 1:1.</p><p>Budesonide is designated chemically as (RS)-11β, 16α, 17,21 tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione cyclic 16,17-acetal with butyraldehyde. The empirical formula of budesonide is C<span class="Sub">25</span>H<span class="Sub">34</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span> and its molecular weight is 430.5. Its structural formula is:</p><p>UCERIS rectal foam contains 2 mg budesonide per metered dose.</p><p>Inactive ingredients: cetyl alcohol, citric acid monohydrate, edetate disodium, emulsifying wax, polyoxyl (10) stearyl ether, propylene glycol, and purified water.</p><p>Propellant: n-butane, isobutane, and propane.</p><h2>Uceris Foam - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Budesonide has glucocorticosteroid (GCS) activity.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Treatment with glucocorticosteroids, including UCERIS rectal foam, is associated with a suppression of endogenous cortisol concentrations and an impairment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. These effects were measured by determination of plasma cortisol concentrations and responses to adrenocorticotropin challenge (i.e., ACTH stimulation test) in 2 placebo-controlled, 6-week trials in patients with active disease <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. These trials enrolled subjects with post-ACTH stimulation cortisol levels of &gt;18 mcg/dL at baseline. Subjects received UCERIS rectal foam 2 mg or a placebo twice daily for 2 weeks followed by once daily for 4 weeks. Normal morning serum cortisol levels &gt;5 mcg/dL were maintained in 85% and 84% of UCERIS rectal foam treated subjects during Weeks 1 and 2 (twice daily treatment) and 93% and 94% during Weeks 4 and 6 (once daily treatment), respectively (see Table 3).</p><p>At baseline (predose), 84% of subjects in the UCERIS rectal foam group had a normal response to the ACTH challenge and at Week 6, 63% of subjects had a normal response to the ACTH challenge; in the placebo group, these values were 86% and 76%, respectively (see Table 3). ACTH stimulation test was not performed routinely during the twice daily treatment period (Weeks 1 and 2).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cortisol Parameter</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">UCERIS Rectal Foam</span></p><p><span class="Bold">2 mg/25 mL</span><br/>

Plasma protein binding is estimated to be 85 to 90% in the concentration range of 1 to 230 nmol/L, independent of gender. The erythrocyte/plasma partition ratio at clinically relevant concentrations is approximately 0.8.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Following absorption, budesonide is subject to first-pass metabolism. In vitro experiments in human liver microsomes demonstrate that budesonide is rapidly and extensively biotransformed, mainly by CYP3A4, to its 2 major metabolites, 6β-hydroxy budesonide and 16α-hydroxy prednisolone. The glucocorticoid activity of these metabolites is negligible (&lt;1/100) in relation to that of the parent compound.</p><p>In vivo investigations with intravenous doses in healthy subjects demonstrate that budesonide has a plasma clearance of 0.9-1.8 L/min. These plasma clearance values approach the estimated liver blood flow, suggesting that budesonide is a high hepatic clearance drug.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Budesonide is excreted in urine and feces in the form of metabolites. After oral as well as intravenous administration of micronized [<span class="Sup">3</span>H]-budesonide, approximately 60% of the recovered radioactivity is found in urine. The major metabolites, including 6β-hydroxybudesonide and 16α-hydroxyprednisolone, are mainly renally excreted, intact or in conjugated forms. No unchanged budesonide is detected in urine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Hepatic Impairment</span></span></p><p>The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of UCERIS rectal foam has not been studied. In a study in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and Child-Pugh Class B) dosed with budesonide 4 mg oral capsules, systemic exposure was similar between patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A; n=4) and healthy subjects (n=8), and 3.5-fold higher in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B; n=4) than in healthy subjects. For the intravenous dose, no significant differences in CL or V<span class="Sub">SS</span> are observed. Patients with severe liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh Class C) were not studied <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Population (8.6)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span></span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of budesonide in patients with renal impairment has not been studied. Intact budesonide is not renally excreted, but metabolites are to a large extent, and might therefore reach higher levels in patients with impaired renal function. However, these metabolites have negligible corticosteroid activity as compared with budesonide.</p><p><span class="Italics">Drug-Drug Interactions</span></p><p>Budesonide is metabolized via CYP3A4. Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 can increase the plasma concentrations of budesonide. Co-administration of ketoconazole (inhibitor of CYP3A4) results in an 8-fold increase in AUC of oral budesonide, compared to budesonide alone. Grapefruit juice, an inhibitor of gut mucosal CYP3A, approximately doubles the systemic exposure of oral budesonide. Conversely, induction of CYP3A4 can result in the lowering of budesonide plasma concentrations. The effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers on the pharmacokinetics of UCERIS rectal foam have not been studied [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2) and Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>Oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol, which are also metabolized by CYP3A4, do not affect the pharmacokinetics of oral budesonide. Budesonide does not affect the plasma concentrations of oral contraceptives (i.e., ethinyl estradiol).</p><p>In vitro interactions studies performed with budesonide showed that budesonide did not inhibit human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, or CYP2E1 at concentrations ranging from 0.11 to 1130 ng/mL. Isoenzyme CYP3A4 was inhibited at the highest concentration tested but the IC<span class="Sub">50</span> was &gt;1130 ng/mL. UCERIS rectal foam is not expected to inhibit these enzymes in clinical use. No significant induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A4/5 expression was observed in human hepatocytes in vitro at budesonide concentrations up to 9000 nM (3.88 mcg/mL).</p><p>In an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study, budesonide was not a substrate of human transporters OATP1B3 and may be a weak substrate of OATP1B1. Budesonide at concentrations up to 300 nM (129 ng/mL) did not inhibit OATP1B1 or OATP1B3.</p><p>Budesonide was not a substrate of BCRP and was a weak substrate of P-glycoprotein. Budesonide was a weak inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (IC<span class="Sub">50</span> 9.78 µM or 4.21 mcg/mL) and BCRP (IC<span class="Sub">50</span> 43.1 µM or 18.6 mcg/mL). UCERIS rectal foam is not expected to inhibit these transporters in clinical use.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Carcinogenicity</span></p><p>Carcinogenicity studies with budesonide were conducted in rats and mice. In a 2-year study in Sprague-Dawley rats, budesonide caused a statistically significant increase in the incidence of gliomas in male rats at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.12 times the recommended intrarectal dose of 4 mg/day in humans, based on the body surface area). In addition, there were increased incidences of primary hepatocellular tumors in male rats at 25 mcg/kg (approximately 0.06 times the recommended intrarectal dose of 4 mg/day in humans, based on the body surface area) and above. No tumorigenicity was seen in female rats at oral doses up to 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.12 times the recommended intrarectal dose of 4 mg/day in humans, based on the body surface area).</p><p>In an additional 2-year study in male Sprague-Dawley rats, budesonide caused no gliomas at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.12 times the recommended intrarectal dose of 4 mg/day in humans, based on the body surface area). However, it caused a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular tumors at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.12 times the recommended intrarectal dose of 4 mg/day in humans, based on the body surface area). The concurrent reference glucocorticosteroids (prednisolone and triamcinolone acetonide) showed similar findings. In a 91-week study in mice, budesonide caused no treatment-related carcinogenicity at oral doses up to 200 mcg/kg (approximately 0.24 times the recommended intrarectal dose of 4 mg/day in humans, based on the body surface area).</p><p><span class="Italics">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Budesonide showed no evidence of mutagenic potential in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell forward gene mutation (TK+/-) test, the human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, the <span class="Italics">Drosophila melanogaster</span> sex-linked recessive lethality test, the rat hepatocyte UDS test or the mouse micronucleus test.</p><p><span class="Italics">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>In rats, budesonide had no effect on fertility at subcutaneous doses up to 80 mcg/kg (approximately 0.20 times recommended intrarectal dose of 4 mg/day in humans, based on the body surface area). However, it caused a decrease in prenatal viability and viability in pups at birth and during lactation, along with a decrease in maternal body-weight gain, at subcutaneous doses of 20 mcg/kg (approximately 0.05 times recommended intrarectal dose of 4 mg/day in humans, based on the body surface area) and above. No such effects were noted at 5 mcg/kg.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of UCERIS rectal foam were evaluated in 2 replicate, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trials (Studies 1 and 2).</p><p>Participants in the trials were adult patients with active mild-to-moderate distal ulcerative colitis with disease extending at least 5 cm but no further than 40 cm from the anal verge (confirmed by endoscopy). To be eligible, patients had to have a Modified Mayo Disease Activity Index (MMDAI) score between 5 and 10, inclusive, a rectal bleeding subscore of 2 or 3, and an endoscopy subscore of 2 or 3. The MMDAI score ranges from 0 to 12 and has 4 subscales that are each scored from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe): stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on endoscopy, and physician global assessment. An endoscopy subscore of 2 is defined by marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, and erosions; an endoscopy subscore of 3 is defined by spontaneous bleeding and ulceration.</p><p>Oral and rectal corticosteroids, and rectal 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) products were prohibited during the course of the trials, but were allowed as rescue therapy. Oral 5-ASA products were allowed at doses ≤ 4.8 grams/day.</p><p>In total, 546 subjects were randomized in these trials: 267 subjects to UCERIS rectal foam and 279 subjects to placebo. In each trial (Study 1 and Study 2), patients received UCERIS rectal foam 2 mg or placebo twice daily for 2 weeks followed by once daily for 4 weeks.</p><p>The median age was 41 years and 42 years, 5% and 8% were ≥ 65 years of age, and 43% and 45% were male, in Studies 1 and 2, respectively. In each of these trials, 90% were Caucasian, 7‑8% were African American, and 3% were Asian or Other.</p><p>The majority of patients had a baseline diagnosis of proctosigmoiditis (69% and 74%) in Studies 1 and 2, respectively. The remaining patients had a baseline diagnosis of proctitis. Concomitant oral 5-ASA use at baseline was 59% and 51% in Studies 1 and 2, respectively.</p><p>Baseline MMDAI total score was 7.8 and 7.9 in the UCERIS rectal foam group and placebo group, respectively, of Study 1; and 7.9 and 8.0 in the UCERIS rectal foam group and placebo group, respectively, of Study 2. The mean stool frequency subscore at baseline was 1.8 and 1.9 in the UCERIS rectal foam group and placebo group, respectively, of Study 1; and 1.7 and 1.8 in the UCERIS rectal foam group and placebo group, respectively, of Study 2.</p><p>In each trial (Study 1 and Study 2), the primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who were in remission after 6 weeks of treatment. Remission was defined as a decrease or no change in the stool frequency subscore from baseline, a rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and an endoscopy score of 0 or 1. (An endoscopy subscore of zero is defined by normal or inactive disease; an endoscopy subscore of 1 is defined by erythema and decreased vascular pattern.)</p><p>In each trial (Study 1 and Study 2), a higher proportion of patients in the UCERIS rectal foam group than in the placebo group were in remission at Week 6, and had a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 at Week 6 (<span class="Bold">Table 4</span>).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Efficacy Endpoint</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study 1</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">UCERIS Rectal Foam</span><br/>
