</ul><h2>Lac-Hydrin Lotion Description</h2><p class="First"><span class="Sup">*</span>Lac-Hydrin specially formulates 12% lactic acid, neutralized with ammonium hydroxide, as ammonium lactate to provide a lotion pH of 4.5-5.5. Lac-Hydrin (ammonium lactate) Lotion, 12% also contains cetyl alcohol, fragrance, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, laureth-4, light mineral oil, magnesium aluminum silicate, methylcellulose, methyl- and propylparabens, PEG-100 stearate, polyoxyl 40 stearate, propylene glycol and water. Lactic acid is a racemic mixture of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and has the following structural formula:</p><h2>Lac-Hydrin Lotion - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Lactic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid. It is a normal constituent of tissues and blood. The alpha-hydroxy acids (and their salts) are felt to act as humectants when applied to the skin. This property may influence hydration of the stratum corneum. In addition, lactic acid, when applied to the skin, may act to decrease corneocyte cohesion. The mechanism(s) by which this is accomplished is not yet known.</p><p>An <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study of percutaneous absorption of Lac-Hydrin Lotion using human cadaver skin indicates that approximately 5.8% of the material was absorbed after 68 hours.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Lac-Hydrin Lotion</h2><p class="First">Lac-Hydrin is indicated for the treatment of dry, scaly skin (xerosis) and ichthyosis vulgaris and for temporary relief of itching associated with these conditions.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Lac-Hydrin Lotion is contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the label ingredients.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Sun exposure to areas of the skin treated with Lac-Hydrin (ammonium lactate) Lotion, 12% should be minimized or avoided (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>). The use of Lac-Hydrin Lotion should be discontinued if hypersensitivity is observed.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">For external use only. Stinging or burning may occur when applied to skin with fissures, erosions or that is otherwise abraded (for example, after shaving the legs). Caution is advised when used on the face because of the potential for irritation. The potential for post-inflammatory hypo- or hyperpigmentation has not been studied.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients using Lac-Hydrin (ammonium lactate) Lotion, 12% should receive the following information and instructions:</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">The topical treatment of CD-1 mice with 12%, 21% or 30% ammonium lactate formulations for two years did not produce a significant increase in dermal or systemic tumors in the absence of increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The maximum systemic exposure of the mice in this study was 0.7 times the maximum possible systemic exposure in humans. However, a long-term photocarcinogenicity study in hairless albino mice suggested that topically applied 12% ammonium lactate formulations enhanced the rate of ultraviolet light-induced skin tumor formation.</p><p>The mutagenic potential of ammonium lactate formulations was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the mouse <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus assay, both of which were negative.</p><p>In dermal Segment I and III studies with ammonium lactate formulations there were no effects observed in fertility or pre- or post-natal development parameters in rats at dose levels of 300 mg/kg/day (1800 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day), approximately 0.4 times the human topical dose.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category B</span></p><p>Animal reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 0.7 and 1.5 times the human dose, respectively (600 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 3600 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day in the rat and 7200 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day in the rabbit) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ammonium lactate formulations. There are, however, no adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Lac-Hydrin Lotion should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Although lactic acid is a normal constituent of blood and tissues, it is not known to what extent this drug affects normal lactic acid levels in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Lac-Hydrin is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Lac-Hydrin have been demonstrated in infants and children. No unusual toxic effects were reported.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Lac-Hydrin (ammonium lactate) Lotion, 12% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most frequent adverse experiences in patients with xerosis are transient stinging (1 in 30 patients), burning (1 in 30 patients), erythema (1 in 50 patients) and peeling (1 in 60 patients). Other adverse reactions which occur less frequently are irritation, eczema, petechiae, dryness and hyperpigmentation.</p><p>Due to the more severe initial skin conditions associated with ichthyosis, there was a higher incidence of transient stinging, burning and erythema (each occurring in 1 in 10 patients).</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The oral administration of Lac-Hydrin to rats and mice showed this drug to be practically non-toxic (LD<span class="Sub">50</span> &gt;15 mL/kg).</p><h2>Lac-Hydrin Lotion Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Shake well. Apply to the affected areas and rub in thoroughly. Use twice daily or as directed by a physician.</p><h2>How is Lac-Hydrin Lotion Supplied</h2><p class="First">Lac-Hydrin<span class="Sup">®</span> (ammonium lactate) Lotion, 12% is available in a 225g (NDC 10631-098-08) plastic bottle and a 400g (NDC 10631-098-14) plastic bottle.</p><p>Store at controlled room temperature 15°C-30° C (59° F-86° F).</p><p><span class="Bold">RANBAXY</span></p><p>Jacksonville, FL 32257 USA</p><p>Revised July 2009</p><h2>PACKAGE LABEL PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL</h2><p class="MultiMediaCaption">225 g extended label – front cover</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">225 g extended label – back cover</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">400 g extended label – front cover</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">400 g extended label – back cover</p><h2>More about ammonium lactate topical</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
