Prescribe injectable epinephrine, instruct and train patients on its appropriate use, and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care upon its use. Do not administer peanut allergen powder to patients with uncontrolled asthma. Dose modifications may be necessary following an anaphylactic reaction. Observe patients during and after administration of the initial dose escalation and the first dose of each up-dosing level, for at least 60 minutes. Because of the risk of anaphylaxis, peanut allergen powder is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Palforzia REMS.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><i><b>Concerns related to adverse effects:</b></i></p><p>• Anaphylaxis: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Peanut allergen powder can cause anaphylaxis, which may be life threatening and can occur at any time during therapy. Dose modifications may be necessary following an anaphylactic reaction. Observe patients during and after administration of the initial dose escalation and the first dose of each up-dosing level for ≥60 minutes. </b>Anaphylaxis most commonly occurs within 2 hours after a dose but may be delayed for &gt;10 hours in some patients. Do not initiate therapy in patients who have had severe or life-threatening anaphylaxis in the previous 60 days. Increased risk of anaphylaxis may occur with potential cofactors, including exercise, hot water exposure, illness, fasting, menstruation, sleep deprivation, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, or uncontrolled asthma; if possible, adjust dosing time to avoid cofactors or temporarily discontinue therapy.</p><p>• Esophagitis: Eosinophilic esophagitis has been reported. Discontinue therapy in patients who experience severe or persistent GI symptoms (eg, dysphagia, vomiting, nausea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chest pain, abdominal pain). Use is contraindicated in patients with a history of eosinophilic esophagitis.</p><p>• GI effects: GI adverse reactions (including abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, oral pruritus, and oral paresthesia) have been reported; dose adjustment may be necessary.</p><p><i><b>Disease-related concerns:</b></i></p><p>• Respiratory disease: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Do not administer to patients with uncontrolled asthma.</b> Uncontrolled asthma is a risk factor for serious outcome in anaphylaxis, including death<b>.</b> Withhold treatment if patient is experiencing an acute asthma exacerbation; resume therapy with caution after resolution of exacerbation. Reevaluate patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and consider discontinuation. Use has not been studied in patients with severe asthma, persistently uncontrolled asthma, or in patients on long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy. Use is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled asthma.</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• Administration: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Prescribe injectable epinephrine, instruct and train patients on its appropriate use, and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care upon its use.</b></p><p>• Appropriate patient selection: Use may not be suitable for patients with conditions that may reduce their ability to survive anaphylaxis, including but not limited to compromised lung function, severe mast cell disorder, or cardiovascular disease.</p><p>• Appropriate use: Discontinue use in patients who are unable to comply with the daily dosing requirements. Use may not be suitable for patients taking medications that can inhibit or potentiate the effects of epinephrine.</p><p>• REMS: <b>[US Boxed Warning]:</b> <b>Because of the risk of anaphylaxis, peanut allergen powder is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the Palforzia REMS.</b></p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Signs/symptoms of adverse reactions; monitor for ≥60 minutes after the last dose of the initial dose escalation and after the first dose of each new up-dosing level.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Accidental exposure to peanuts in a peanut allergic woman may cause anaphylaxis, which may then decrease maternal BP and placental perfusion. Anaphylaxis may also occur following exposure to peanut allergen powder. Pregnant women were excluded from initial studies of peanut allergen powder as oral immunotherapy (PALISADE Group [Vickery 2018]). In general, immunotherapy should not be initiated during pregnancy (Pitsios 2019). Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes following exposure to peanut allergen powder is ongoing. Health care providers are encouraged to enroll females exposed to peanut allergen powder during pregnancy in the pregnancy registry (1-833-246-2566).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to help with allergies caused by peanuts.
