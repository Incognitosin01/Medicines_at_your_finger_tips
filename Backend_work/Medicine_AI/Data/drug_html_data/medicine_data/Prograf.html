Organ rejection happens when the immune system treats the new organ as an invader and attacks it.</p><p>Prograf is a prescription medicine and is used together with other medicines to prevent your body from rejecting a heart, liver, or kidney transplant.</p><p>Prograf is supplied as oral capsules, granules for oral suspension, and as an injection for intravenous use.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Prograf may increase your risk of developing a serious infection, lymphoma, or other cancers.

Your risk may be higher if you are treated over long periods of time with drugs that weaken the immune system.
