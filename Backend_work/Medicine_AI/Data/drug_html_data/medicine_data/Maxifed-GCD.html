It affects the signals in the brain that trigger cough reflex.</p><p>Guaifenesin is an expectorant. It helps loosen congestion in your chest and throat, making it easier to cough out through your mouth.</p><p>Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages. Dilated blood vessels can cause nasal congestion (stuffy nose).</p><p>Maxifed-G CD is a combination medicine used to treat cough, stuffy nose, and sinus congestion caused by allergies, the common cold, or the flu.</p><p> Maxifed-G CD will not treat a cough that is caused by smoking, asthma, or emphysema.</p><p>Maxifed-G CD may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Codeine can slow or stop your breathing, and may be habit-forming. <b>MISUSE OF THIS MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b></p><p><b>This medicine is not for use in anyone under 18.</b></p><p><b>Taking this medicine during pregnancy may cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the newborn.</b></p><p><b>Fatal side effects can occur if you use this medicine with alcohol, or with other drugs that cause drowsiness or slow your breathing.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use  Maxifed-G CD if you are allergic to codeine, guaifenesin, or pseudoephedrine.</p><p>Do not use this medicine if you have used an MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days.
