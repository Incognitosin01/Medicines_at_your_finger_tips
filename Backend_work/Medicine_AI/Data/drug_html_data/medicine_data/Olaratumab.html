Monoclonal antibodies are made to target and destroy only certain cells in the body, which may help slow or stop tumor growth.</p><p>Olaratumab is used in combination with another cancer medicine called doxorubicin, to treat adults with soft tissue sarcoma. Olaratumab is used when your condition cannot be treated with surgery or radiation.</p><p>Olaratumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on an "accelerated" basis. In clinical studies,  olaratumab was shown to lengthen survival time.
