cold, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis and other upper respiratory tract conditions. Appropriate therapy should be provided for the<br/>
primary disease.<br/></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Patients with hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to any of its ingredients. Sympathomimetic amines are contraindicated<br/>
in patients with severe hypertension, severe coronary heart disease and patients on monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor<br/>
therapy.<br/></p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Sympathomimetic amines should be used judiciously and sparingly in patients with hypertension, diabetes, ischemic<br/>
heart disease, hyperthyroidism, increased intraocular pressure, or prostatic hypertrophy. (See <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).<br/>
Sympathomimetic amines may produce CNS stimulation with convulsions or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying<br/>
hypotension. The elderly (60 years and older) are more likely to exhibit adverse reactions.</p><p>A persistent cough may be a sign of a serious condition. If cough persists for more than one week or tends to recur, or is<br/>
accompanied by fever, rash, or persistent headache, patient re-evaluation should be considered.<br/></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> There are studies which demonstrate that carbetapentane has antitussive activity which may suppress or modify<br/>
cough. Before prescribing medication to suppress or modify cough, identify and provide therapy for the underlying cause of<br/>
the cough and take caution that modification of cough does not increase the risk of clinical or physiologic complications.</p><p>Use with caution in patients with hypertension, heart disease, asthma, hyperthyroidism, increased intraocular pressure,<br/>
diabetes mellitus, and prostatic hypertrophy.<br/></p><h2>Information for patients:</h2><p class="First">Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants while taking this product. Patients sensitive to sympathomimetics may note<br/>
mild CNS stimulation.<br/></p><h2>Drug Interactions:</h2><h2>Pregnancy Category C:</h2><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is not known whether this product can cause fetal<br/>
harm when administered to a pregnant woman or affect reproductive capacity. Give to pregnant women only if clearly needed.<br/></p><h2>Nursing Mothers:</h2><p class="First">It is not known if the drugs in this product are excreted in human milk. Since many drugs may be excreted into human milk<br/>
and because of the potential for serious side effects in the nursing infant, this product should only be given to nursing mothers<br/>
if clearly needed.<br/></p><h2>Pediatric use:</h2><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of six have not been established. Product not intended for<br/>
administration for children 6 years of age and under.<br/></p><h2>Geriatric use:</h2><p class="First">The elderly (60 years and older) are more likely to have adverse reactions to sympathomimetics. Overdosage of<br/>
sympathomimetics in this age group may cause hallucinations, convulsions, CNS depression and death.<br/></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse effects associated with Carbetapentane citrate are rare, but nausea and/or other gastrointestinal disturbances<br/>
sometimes occur.</p><p><span class="Bold">Sympathomimetic Amines:</span> Convulsions, CNS stimulation, cardiac arrhythmia, respiratory difficulties, increased heart<br/>
rate or blood pressure, hallucinations, tremors, nervousness, insomnia, pallor and dysuria.<br/></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The signs, symptoms and treatment described below are those of pseudoephedrine and carbetapentane.</p><p><span class="Bold">Symptoms:</span> Should sympathomimetic symptoms predominate, central effects includes restlessness, dizziness, tremor,<br/>
hyperactive reflexes, talkativeness, irritability, and insomnia. Cardiovascular and renal effects include difficulty in micturition,<br/>
headache, flushing, palpitation, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension with subsequent hypotension and circulatory collapse.<br/>
Gastrointestinal effects include dry mouth, metallic taste, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment:</span><br/>
a) Evacuate stomach as condition warrants. Activated charcoal may be useful.<br/>
b) Maintain a non-stimulating environment.<br/>
c) Monitor cardiovascular status.<br/>
d) Do not give stimulants.<br/>
e) Reduce fever with sponging.<br/>
f) Use sedatives or anticonvulsants to control CNS excitation, and convulsions.<br/>
g) Physostigmine may reverse anti-cholinergic symptoms.<br/>
h) Ammonium Chloride may acidify the urine to increase urinary excretion of pseudoephedrine.<br/>
I) Further care is symptomatic and supportive.<br/></p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION*</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults and Children 12 years of age and older:</span><br/>
