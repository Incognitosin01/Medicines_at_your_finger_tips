HBIG differs from immune globulin in the amount of anti-HBs. Immune globulin is prepared from plasma that is not preselected for anti-HBs content. HBIG is prepared from plasma preselected for high titer anti-HBs. In the US, HBIG has an anti-HBs high titer &gt;1:100,000 by IRA.</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>IM: Slow</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>V<sub>d</sub>: 7 to 15 L</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Serum: IM: 2 to 10 days</p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>Postexposure prophylaxis: 3 to 6 months</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>17 to 25 days</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p>Postexposure prophylaxis following acute exposure to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) blood, plasma, or serum (eg, parenteral exposure, direct mucus membrane contact, oral ingestion); perinatal exposure of infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers; sexual exposure to HBsAg-positive persons; and household exposure to persons with acute HBV infection</p><p>In addition, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) also recommends administration to neonates born to mothers in which HBsAg test results are not available and other evidence suggests possible maternal HBV infection; postexposure prophylaxis to a health care provider (HCP) in which the source has an unknown HBsAg status; in a nonoccupational setting, postexposure prophylaxis to a person who has not been completely vaccinated (CDC/ACIP [Schillie 2018]).</p><p>Prevention of hepatitis B virus recurrence after liver transplantation in HBsAg-positive transplant patients (HepaGam B only)</p><p><b>Note:</b> Hepatitis B immune globulin is not indicated for treatment of active hepatitis B infection and is ineffective in the treatment of chronic active hepatitis B infection.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>HepaGam B: Anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to human globulin preparations; IgA deficiency; postexposure prophylaxis in patients with severe thrombocytopenia or other coagulation disorders which would contraindicate IM injections (administer only if benefit outweighs the risk)</p><p>HyperHEP B S/D: No contraindications listed in manufacturer's labeling</p><p>Nabi-HB: Anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to human globulin preparations</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Postexposure prophylaxis:</b> IM: 0.06 mL/kg as soon as possible after exposure (ie, within 24 hours of needlestick, ocular, or mucosal exposure or within 14 days of sexual exposure); repeat at 28 to 30 days after exposure in non-responders to hepatitis B vaccine or in patients who refuse vaccination</p><p><b>Postexposure management of health care personnel (HCP)</b> (CDC/ACIP [Schillie 2018]):</p><p>If the HCP has prior documentation of ≥3 doses of a hepatitis B vaccine and a post-vaccination anti-HBs ≥10 milliunits/mL, then HBIG is not needed, regardless of the patients HBsAg status.</p><p>If the HCP is unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated, and if the source patient is HBsAg positive or their status is unknown, one dose HBIG should be administered.

Use with caution in patients with isolated immunoglobulin A deficiency or a history of systemic hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulins.</p><p>• Infusion reactions: When administered IV, do not exceed recommended infusion rates; may increase risk of adverse events. Patients should be monitored for adverse events during and after the infusion.</p><p>• Thrombotic events: Thrombotic events have been reported with administration of intravenous immune globulin; use with caution in patients of advanced age, with a history of atherosclerosis or cardiovascular and/or thrombotic risk factors, patients with impaired cardiac output, coagulation disorders, prolonged immobilization, or patients with known/suspected hyperviscosity. Consider a baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorders; IM injections may be contraindicated.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Human plasma: Product of human plasma; may potentially contain infectious agents which could transmit disease. Screening of donors, as well as testing and/or inactivation or removal of certain viruses, reduces the risk. Infections thought to be transmitted by this product should be reported to the manufacturer.</p><p>• Maltose: Some products may contain maltose, which may result in falsely-elevated blood glucose readings.</p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984).
