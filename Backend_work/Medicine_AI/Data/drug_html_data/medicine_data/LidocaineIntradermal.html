Lidocaine prevents pain by blocking the signals at the nerve endings in the skin. Lidocaine does not cause loss of consciousness as general anesthetics do when used for surgery.</p><p>Lidocaine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using lidocaine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For lidocaine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to lidocaine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of lidocaine injection in children younger than 3 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of lidocaine injection in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of lidocaine</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you lidocaine in a medical facility. Lidocaine is given by placing a special round device on your skin. The device pushes the medicine into the skin, and does not use a needle to do this. You or your child will hear a popping sound when the medicine is given.</p><p>Lidocaine is for use <i>on the skin only</i>. It will not be used on skin areas that have cuts or scrapes. Do not get it into your eyes, nose, or mouth. If it does get on these areas, rinse it off right away.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using lidocaine</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check you or your child's progress closely</i> to make sure lidocaine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for any problems or unwanted effects that may be caused by lidocaine.</p><p>Lidocaine may cause a rare, but serious blood problem called methemoglobinemia. The risk may be increased in children younger than 6 months of age, elderly patients, or patients with certain inborn defects. It is more likely to occur in patients receiving too much of the medicine, but can also occur with small amounts. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child has the following symptoms after receiving lidocaine: pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nails, confusion, headache, lightheadedness, fast heartbeat, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Do not let your child get any of the medicine in the mouth. Lidocaine can cause serious side effects, especially in children, if any of it gets into the mouth and is swallowed.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Lidocaine side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
