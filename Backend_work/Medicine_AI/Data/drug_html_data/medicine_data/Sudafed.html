Dilated blood vessels can cause nasal congestion (stuffy nose).</p><p>Sudafed is used to treat nasal and sinus congestion, or congestion of the tubes that drain fluid from your inner ears, called the eustachian (yoo-STAY-shun) tubes.</p><p>Sudafed may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Do not give Sudafed to a child younger than 4 years old.
