An increased need for medication could be an early sign of a serious asthma attack.</p><p>Your dosage of Pulmicort may change if you have surgery, are ill, are under stress, or have recently had an asthma attack. Talk with your doctor if any of your asthma medications do not seem to work as well in treating or preventing asthma attacks.</p><p>If you also use an oral steroid medication, do not stop using the steroid suddenly or you may have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Talk with your doctor about taking less and less of the steroid before stopping completely.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Pulmicort if you are allergic to budesonide, or if:</p><ul>

Follow all directions on your prescription label. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results. Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p><b>Pulmicort is not a rescue medicine. It will not work fast enough to treat an asthma attack.</b> Use only a fast acting inhalation medicine for an asthma attack.</p><p>Use only the inhaler device that comes with Pulmicort Flexhaler. Do not place the device in water or try to take it apart. The Flexhaler device has a dose counter that shows how many doses are left inside. The dose-counter indicator may not appear to move until about 5 doses have been used. Do not use an extra dose just because the Flexhaler indicator has not moved to a lower number after just one use.</p><p>Always rinse your mouth with water after using the Pulmicort Flexhaler, to help prevent thrush (a fungal infection in the mouth or throat). If you are using a nebulizer with a face mask, wash the mask area of your face after each use.</p><p>Do not allow a young child to use Pulmicort Flexhaler without help from an adult.</p><p>Pulmicort Respules should be used only with a standard jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor. Do not mix with other medicines in the nebulizer cup (reservoir).</p><p>Your doctor will need to check your progress on a regular basis. Your vision or bone mineral density may also need to be checked.</p><p>Using a steroid can weaken your immune system. This can make it easier for you to get sick from being around others who are ill.</p><p>Your dose needs may change if you have surgery, are ill, are under stress, or have recently had an asthma attack. Do not change your medication dose or schedule without your doctor's advice.</p><p><b>Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve after the first week of treatment, or if you think your asthma medications are not working as well.</b> If you use a peak flow meter at home, tell your doctor if your numbers are lower than normal.</p><p>Store at room temperature, away from moisture, light, and heat. Keep the cover on your inhaler device while not in use.</p><p>Store Pulmicort Respules upright in the foil envelope. When you are ready to use the medicine, remove an ampule and put the strip back in the envelope. Once you have opened an envelope, you must use the ampules within 2 weeks.</p><p>In case of emergency, wear or carry medical identification to let others know you use a steroid medication.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Skip the missed dose and use your next dose at the regular time. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>High doses or long-term use of budesonide can lead to thinning skin, easy bruising, changes in body fat (especially in your face, neck, back, and waist), increased acne or facial hair, menstrual problems, impotence, or loss of interest in sex.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using Pulmicort?</h2><p>Avoid getting Pulmicort in your eyes.</p><p>Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Call your doctor for preventive treatment if you are exposed to chickenpox or measles. These conditions can be serious or even fatal in people who are using steroid medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Pulmicort side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Pulmicort</b>: hives, rash, severe itching; chest pain, difficult breathing, feeling anxious; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
