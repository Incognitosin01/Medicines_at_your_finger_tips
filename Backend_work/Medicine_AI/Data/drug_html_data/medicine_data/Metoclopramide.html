This speeds up the rate at which the stomach empties into the intestines.</p><p>Metoclopramide oral (taken by mouth) is used for 4 to 12 weeks to treat heartburn caused by gastroesophageal reflux in people who have used other medications without relief.</p><p>Metoclopramide oral is also used to treat gastroparesis (slow stomach emptying) in people with diabetes, which can cause heartburn and stomach discomfort after meals.</p><p>Metoclopramide injection is used to treat severe diabetic gastroparesis. The injection is also used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy or surgery, or to aid in certain medical procedures involving the stomach or intestines.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Do not use this medicine if you've ever had muscle movement problems after using metoclopramide or similar medicines, or if you've had a movement disorder called tardive dyskinesia. You also should not use this medicine if you've had stomach or intestinal problems (a blockage, bleeding, or a hole or tear), epilepsy or other seizure disorder, or an adrenal gland tumor (pheochromocytoma).</p><p><b>NEVER USE METOCLOPRAMIDE IN LARGER AMOUNTS THAN RECOMMENDED, OR FOR LONGER THAN 12 WEEKS.</b> High doses or long-term use can cause a serious movement disorder that may not be reversible. The longer you use metoclopramide, the more likely you are to develop this movement disorder. The risk of this side effect is higher in diabetics and older adults (especially women).</p><p>Before you take metoclopramide, tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver disease, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, or a history of depression.</p><p>Do not drink alcohol. It can increase some of the side effects of metoclopramide.</p><p>Stop using metoclopramide and call your doctor at once if you have tremors or uncontrolled muscle movements, fever, stiff muscles, confusion, sweating, fast or uneven heartbeats, rapid breathing, depressed mood, thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself, hallucinations, anxiety, agitation, seizure, or jaundice (yellowing of your skin or eyes).</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use metoclopramide if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p><ul>

Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides.

Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully.</p><p>Do not use two different forms of metoclopramide (such as tablets and oral syrup) at the same time.</p><p>Measure liquid medicine carefully. Use the dosing syringe provided, or use a medicine dose-measuring device (not a kitchen spoon).</p><p>To take the orally disintegrating tablet (ODT):</p><ul>
