It is also used together with other medicines (eg, cisplatin) for the first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC.</p><p>Vinorelbine belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells also may be affected by vinorelbine, other effects can occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, such as hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.</p><p>Vinorelbine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using vinorelbine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of vinorelbine</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you vinorelbine in a medical facility. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins.</p><p>Vinorelbine is sometimes given together with certain other medicines.

However, it is very important that you continue to receive it, even if you begin to feel ill. Ask your health care professional for ways to lessen these effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using vinorelbine</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress closely and at regular visits</i> to make sure that vinorelbine is working properly. Blood and urine tests are needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Receiving vinorelbine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. It may also cause birth defects if the father is receiving it when his sexual partner becomes pregnant. Female patients should use effective birth control during treatment with vinorelbine and for 6 months after the last dose. Male patients who have female partners should use effective birth control during treatment with vinorelbine and for 3 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving vinorelbine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Vinorelbine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infection. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or have painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose, unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects, such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury can occur.</li>
</ul><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.</p><p>Vinorelbine may cause severe constipation, stomach or bowel blockage, or perforation, which can be life-threatening. Check with your doctor right away if you have stomach cramps or pain, black, tarry stools, diarrhea, fever, or severe vomiting, sometimes with blood.</p><p>If vinorelbine accidentally leaks out of the vein into which it is injected, it may damage the skin tissue and cause scarring. Tell the doctor or nurse right away if you notice redness, pain, or swelling at the place of injection.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have burning, tingling, numbness, or pain in the hands, arms, feet, or legs ,sensation of pins and needles, stabbing pain, or muscle weakness. These may be signs of a brain or nerve problem.</p><p>Serious lung or breathing problems (eg, bronchospasm, interstitial pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome) may occur after you get a shot of vinorelbine into one of your muscles. Call your doctor right away if have any changes in your breathing after you receive vinorelbine.</p><p>If you plan to have children, talk with your doctor before receiving vinorelbine.
