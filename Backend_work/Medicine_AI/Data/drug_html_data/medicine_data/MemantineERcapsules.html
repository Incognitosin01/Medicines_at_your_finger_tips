</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Memantine ER capsules</h2><p class="First">Memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules are indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer's type.</p><h2>Memantine ER capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosing</h3><p class="First">The dosage of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules shown to be effective in a controlled clinical trial is 28 mg once daily.</p><p>The recommended starting dose of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules is 7 mg once daily. The dose should be increased in 7 mg increments to the recommended maintenance dose of 28 mg once daily. The minimum recommended interval between dose increases is one week. The dose should only be increased if the previous dose has been well tolerated. The maximum recommended dose is 28 mg once daily.</p><p>Memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules can be taken with or without food. Memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules can be taken intact or may be opened, sprinkled on applesauce, and thereby swallowed. The entire contents of each memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsule should be consumed; the dose should not be divided.</p><p>Except when opened and sprinkled on applesauce, as described above, memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules should be swallowed whole. Memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules should not be divided, chewed, or crushed.</p><p>If a patient misses a single dose of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules, that patient should not double up on the next dose. The next dose should be taken as scheduled. If a patient fails to take memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules for several days, dosing may need to be resumed at lower doses and retitrated as described above.</p><h3>Switching from Memantine Hydrochloride Tablets to Memantine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules</h3><p class="First">Patients treated with memantine hydrochloride tablets may be switched to memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules as follows:</p><p>It is recommended that a patient who is on a regimen of 10 mg twice daily of memantine hydrochloride tablets be switched to memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 28 mg once daily capsules the day following the last dose of 10 mg memantine hydrochloride tablets. There is no study addressing the comparative efficacy of these 2 regimens.</p><p>In a patient with severe renal impairment, it is recommended that a patient who is on a regimen of 5 mg twice daily of memantine hydrochloride tablets be switched to memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 14 mg once daily capsules the day following the last dose of 5 mg memantine hydrochloride tablets.</p><h3>Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 5 – 29 mL/min, based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation), the recommended maintenance dose (and maximum recommended dose) is 14 mg/day <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Each capsule contains 7 mg, 14 mg, 21 mg, or 28 mg of memantine hydrochloride.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to memantine hydrochloride or to any excipients used in the formulation.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Genitourinary Conditions</h3><p class="First">Conditions that raise urine pH may decrease the urinary elimination of memantine resulting in increased plasma levels of memantine. <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules were evaluated in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in which a total of 676 patients with moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (341 patients on memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 28 mg/day and 335 patients on placebo) for a treatment period up to 24 weeks.</p><p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation</span></p><p>In the placebo-controlled clinical trial of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules, the proportion of patients in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsule group and the placebo group who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 10% and 6%, respectively. The most common adverse reaction that led to treatment discontinuation in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsule group was dizziness at a rate of 1.5%.</p><p><span class="Bold">Most Common Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>The most commonly observed adverse reactions seen in patients administered memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in the controlled clinical trial, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsule group and at a higher frequency than placebo were headache, diarrhea and dizziness.</p><p>Table 1 lists adverse reactions that were observed at an incidence of ≥ 2% in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsule group and occurred at a rate greater than placebo.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reaction</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span><br/>

In clinical trials of memantine, seizures occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with memantine and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of memantine.</p><p>Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions include:</p><p>Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, leukopenia (including neutropenia), pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.</p><p>Cardiac Disorders: cardiac failure congestive.</p><p>Gastrointestinal Disorders: pancreatitis.</p><p>Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatitis.</p><p>Psychiatric Disorders: suicidal ideation.</p><p>Renal and Urinary Disorders: acute renal failure (including increased creatinine and renal insufficiency).</p><p>Skin Disorders: Stevens Johnson syndrome.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drugs That Make Urine Alkaline</h3><p class="First">The clearance of memantine was reduced by about 80% under alkaline urine conditions at pH 8. Therefore, alterations of urine pH towards the alkaline condition may lead to an accumulation of the drug with a possible increase in adverse effects. Urine pH is altered by diet, drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate) and clinical state of the patient (e.g. renal tubular acidosis or severe infections of the urinary tract). Hence, memantine should be used with caution under these conditions.</p><h3>Use with Other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) Antagonists</h3><p class="First">The combined use of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules with other NMDA antagonists (amantadine, ketamine, and dextromethorphan) has not been systematically evaluated and such use should be approached with caution.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in pregnant women.</p><p>Adverse developmental effects (decreased body weight and skeletal ossification) were observed in the offspring of rats administered memantine during pregnancy at doses associated with minimal maternal toxicity. These doses are higher than those used in humans at the maximum recommended daily dose of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules <span class="Italics">[see Data].</span></p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Oral administration of memantine (0, 2, 6, or 18 mg/kg/day) to rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased skeletal ossification in fetuses at the highest dose tested. The higher no-effect dose for adverse developmental effects (6 mg/kg) is 2 times the maximum recommended human daily dose (MRHD) of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules (28 mg) on a body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) basis.</p><p>Oral administration of memantine to rabbits (0, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day) during the period of organogenesis resulted in no adverse developmental effects. The highest dose tested is approximately 20 times the MRHD of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><p>In rats, memantine (0, 2, 6, or 18 mg/kg/day) was administered orally prior to and throughout mating and, in females, through the period of organogenesis or continuing throughout lactation to weaning. Decreased skeletal ossification in fetuses and decreased body weight in pups were observed at the highest dose tested. The higher no-effect dose for adverse developmental effects (6 mg/kg/day) is 2 times the MRHD of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><p>Oral administration of memantine (0, 2, 6, or 18 mg/kg/day) to rats from late gestation throughout lactation to weaning, resulted in decreased pup weights at the highest dose tested. The higher no-effect dose (6 mg/kg/day) is approximately 2 times the MRHD of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of memantine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules on milk production.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from memantine hydrochloride extended- release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><p>Memantine failed to demonstrate efficacy in two 12-week controlled clinical studies of 578 pediatric patients aged 6-12 years with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including autism, Asperger’s disorder and Pervasive Development Disorder -Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). Memantine has not been studied in pediatric patients under 6 years of age or over 12 years of age. Memantine treatment was initiated at 3 mg/day and the dose was escalated to the target dose (weight-based) by week 6. Oral doses of memantine 3, 6, 9, or 15 mg extended-release capsules were administered once daily to patients with weights &lt; 20 kg, 20-39 kg, 40-59 kg and ≥ 60 kg, respectively.</p><p>In a randomized, 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study (Study A) in patients with autism, there was no statistically significant difference in the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) total raw score between patients randomized to memantine (n=54) and those randomized to placebo (n=53). In a 12-week responder-enriched randomized withdrawal study (Study B) in 471 patients with ASD, there was no statistically significant difference in the loss of therapeutic response rates between patients randomized to remain on full-dose memantine (n=153) and those randomized to switch to placebo (n=158).</p><p>The overall safety profile of memantine in pediatric patients was generally consistent with the known safety profile in adults <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>In Study A, the adverse reactions in the memantine group (n=56) that were reported in at least 5% of patients and at least twice the frequency of the placebo group (N=58) are listed in Table 2.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reaction</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Memantine</span><br/>

Body weights were reduced at 45 mg/kg/day. Delays in sexual maturation were noted in male and female rats at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day. Memantine induced neuronal lesions in several areas of the brain on PND 15 and 17 at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day. Behavioral toxicity (decrease percent of auditory startle habituation) was noted for animals in the 45 mg/kg/day dose group. The 15 mg/kg/day dose was considered the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for this study.</p><p>In a second juvenile rat toxicity study, male and female juvenile rats were administered memantine (1, 3, 8, 15, 30, and 45 mg/kg/day) starting on postnatal day (PND) 7 through PND 70. Due to early memantine-related mortality, the 30 and 45 mg/kg/day dose groups were terminated without further evaluation. Memantine induced apoptosis or neuronal degeneration in several areas of the brain on PND 8, 10, and 17 at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for apoptosis and neuronal degeneration was 8 mg/kg/day. Behavioral toxicity (effects on motor activity, auditory startle habituation, and learning and memory) was noted at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg/day during treatment, but was not seen after drug discontinuation. Therefore, the 1 mg/kg/day dose was considered the NOAEL for the neurobehavioral effect in this study.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The majority of people with Alzheimer’s disease are 65 years of age and older. In the clinical study of memantine hydrochloride extended-release, the mean age of patients was approximately 77 years; over 91% of patients were 65 years and older, 67% were 75 years and older, and 14% were at or above 85 years of age. The efficacy and safety data presented in the clinical trial sections were obtained from these patients. There were no clinically meaningful differences in most adverse reactions reported by patient groups ≥ 65 years old and &lt; 65 years old.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. A dosage reduction is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules were not studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Signs and symptoms most often accompanying overdosage with other formulations of memantine in clinical trials and from worldwide marketing experience, alone or in combination with other drugs and/or alcohol, include agitation, asthenia, bradycardia, confusion, coma, dizziness, ECG changes, increased blood pressure, lethargy, loss of consciousness, psychosis, restlessness, slowed movement, somnolence, stupor, unsteady gait, visual hallucinations, vertigo, vomiting, and weakness. The largest known ingestion of memantine worldwide was 2 grams in a patient who took memantine in conjunction with unspecified antidiabetic medications. This patient experienced coma, diplopia, and agitation, but subsequently recovered.</p><p>One patient participating in a memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsule clinical trial unintentionally took 112 mg of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules daily for 31 days and experienced an elevated serum uric acid, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, and low platelet count.</p><p>Fatal outcome has been very rarely reported with memantine, and the relationship to memantine was unclear.</p><p>Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving, it is advisable to contact a poison control center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an overdose of any drug. As in any cases of overdose, general supportive measures should be utilized, and treatment should be symptomatic.</p><p>Elimination of memantine can be enhanced by acidification of urine.</p><h2>Memantine ER capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Memantine hydrochloride is an orally active NMDA receptor antagonist. The chemical name for memantine hydrochloride is 1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane hydrochloride with the following structural formula:</p><p>The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">12</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>N•HCl and the molecular weight is 215.76. Memantine hydrochloride occurs as a fine white to off-white powder and is soluble in water.</p><p>Memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules are supplied for oral administration as 7 mg, 14 mg, 21 mg, and 28 mg capsules. Each capsule contains extended-release beads with the labeled amount of memantine hydrochloride and the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, medium chain triglycerides, oleic acid, polyethylene glycol, sugar spheres and talc, in hard gelatin capsules (containing gelatin, titanium dioxide and red iron oxide) imprinted with black ink containing black iron oxide, potassium hydroxide (14 mg and 28 mg), propylene glycol, and shellac.</p><h2>Memantine ER capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Persistent activation of central nervous system N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors by the excitatory amino acid glutamate has been hypothesized to contribute to the symptomatology of Alzheimer’s disease. Memantine is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect through its action as a low to moderate affinity uncompetitive (open-channel) NMDA receptor antagonist which binds preferentially to the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels. There is no evidence that memantine prevents or slows neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Memantine showed low to negligible affinity for GABA, benzodiazepine, dopamine, adrenergic, histamine and glycine receptors and for voltage-dependent Ca<span class="Sup">2+</span>, Na<span class="Sup">+</span>, or K<span class="Sup">+</span> channels. Memantine also showed antagonistic effects at the 5HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptor with a potency similar to that for the NMDA receptor and blocked nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with one-sixth to one-tenth the potency.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that memantine does not affect the reversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by donepezil, galantamine, or tacrine.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Memantine is well absorbed after oral administration and has linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range. It is excreted predominantly unchanged in urine and has a terminal elimination half life of about 60-80 hours. In a study comparing 28 mg once daily memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules to 10 mg twice daily memantine hydrochloride tablets, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> values were 48% and 33% higher for the XR dosage regimen, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>After multiple dose administration of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules, memantine peak concentrations occur around 9-12 hours postdose. There is no difference in the absorption of memantine hydrochloride when the capsule is taken intact or when the contents are sprinkled on applesauce.</p><p>There is no difference in memantine exposure, based on C<span class="Sub">max</span> or AUC, for memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules whether that drug product is administered with food or on an empty stomach. However, peak plasma concentrations are achieved about 18 hours after administration with food versus approximately 25 hours after administration on an empty stomach.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The mean volume of distribution of memantine is 9-11 L/kg and the plasma protein binding is low (45%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Memantine undergoes partial hepatic metabolism. The hepatic microsomal CYP450 enzyme system does not play a significant role in the metabolism of memantine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Memantine is excreted predominantly unchanged in the urine and has a terminal elimination half-life of about 60-80 hours. About 48% of administered drug is excreted unchanged in urine; the remainder is converted primarily to three polar metabolites which possess minimal NMDA receptor antagonistic activity: the N-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy-memantine, and 1-nitroso-deaminated memantine. A total of 74% of the administered dose is excreted as the sum of the parent drug and the N-glucuronide conjugate. Renal clearance involves active tubular secretion moderated by pH dependent tubular reabsorption.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Elderly</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of memantine in young and elderly subjects are similar.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gender</span></p><p>Following multiple dose administration of memantine hydrochloride 20 mg daily, females had about 45% higher exposure than males, but there was no difference in exposure when body weight was taken into account.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Memantine pharmacokinetics were evaluated following single oral administration of 20 mg memantine hydrochloride in 8 subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance, CLcr, &gt; 50 – 80 mL/min), 8 subjects with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 – 49 mL/min), 7 subjects with severe renal impairment (CLcr 5 – 29 mL/min) and 8 healthy subjects (CLcr &gt; 80 mL/min) matched as closely as possible by age, weight and gender to the subjects with renal impairment. Mean AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> increased by 4%, 60%, and 115% in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. The terminal elimination half-life increased by 18%, 41%, and 95% in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Memantine pharmacokinetics were evaluated following the administration of single oral doses of 20 mg in 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7-9) and 8 subjects who were age-, gender-, and weight-matched to the hepatically-impaired subjects. There was no change in memantine exposure (based on C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment as compared with healthy subjects. However, terminal elimination half-life increased by about 16% in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment as compared with healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug-Drug Interactions</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Use with Cholinesterase Inhibitors</span></p><p>Coadministration of memantine with the AChE inhibitor donepezil did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either compound. Furthermore, memantine did not affect AChE inhibition by donepezil. In a 24-week controlled clinical study in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease, the adverse reaction profile observed with a combination of memantine immediate-release and donepezil was similar to that of donepezil alone.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Memantine on the Metabolism of Other Drugs</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies conducted with marker substrates of CYP450 enzymes (CYP1A2, -2A6, 2C9, -2D6, -2E1, -3A4) showed minimal inhibition of these enzymes by memantine. In addition, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies indicate that at concentrations exceeding those associated with efficacy, memantine does not induce the cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP1A2, -2C9, 2E1 and -3A4/5. No pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs metabolized by these enzymes are expected.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of memantine for interaction with warfarin and bupropion. Memantine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the CYP2B6 substrate bupropion or its metabolite hydroxybupropion. Furthermore, memantine did not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin as assessed by the prothrombin INR.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Other Drugs on Memantine</span></p><p>Memantine is predominantly renally eliminated, and drugs that are substrates and/or inhibitors of the CYP450 system are not expected to alter the metabolism of memantine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Drugs Eliminated via Renal Mechanisms</span></p><p>Because memantine is eliminated in part by tubular secretion, coadministration of drugs that use the same renal cationic system, including hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), triamterene (TA), metformin, cimetidine, ranitidine, quinidine, and nicotine, could potentially result in altered plasma levels of both agents. However, coadministration of memantine and HCTZ/TA did not affect the bioavailability of either memantine or TA, and the bioavailability of HCTZ decreased by 20%. In addition, coadministration of memantine with the antihyperglycemic drug Glucovance<span class="Sup">®</span> (glyburide and metformin hydrochloride) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of memantine, metformin and glyburide. Furthermore, memantine did not modify the serum glucose lowering effect of Glucovance, indicating the absence of a pharmacodynamic interaction.</p><p><span class="Italics">Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Proteins</span></p><p>Because the plasma protein binding of memantine is low (45%), an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to plasma proteins, such as warfarin and digoxin, is unlikely.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in a 113-week oral study in mice at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (7 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). There was also no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats orally dosed at up to 40 mg/kg/day for 71 weeks followed by 20 mg/kg/day (14 and 7 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively) through 128 weeks.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Memantine produced no evidence of genotoxic potential when evaluated in the <span class="Italics">in vitro S. typhimurium</span> or <span class="Italics">E. coli</span> reverse mutation assay, an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes, an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> cytogenetics assay for chromosome damage in rats, and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay. The results were equivocal in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> gene mutation assay using Chinese hamster V79 cells.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>No impairment of fertility or reproductive performance was seen in rats administered up to 18 mg/kg/day (6 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) orally from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and lactation in females, or for 60 days prior to mating in males.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Memantine induced neuronal lesions (vacuolation and necrosis) in the multipolar and pyramidal cells in cortical layers III and IV of the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial neocortices in rats, similar to those which are known to occur in rodents administered other NMDA receptor antagonists. Lesions were seen after a single dose of memantine. In a study in which rats were given daily oral doses of memantine for 14 days, the no-effect dose for neuronal necrosis was 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD of 28 mg/day) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><p>In acute and repeat-dose neurotoxicity studies in female rats, oral administration of memantine and donepezil in combination resulted in increased incidence, severity, and distribution of neurodegeneration compared with memantine alone. The no-effect levels of the combination were associated with clinically relevant plasma memantine and donepezil exposures.</p><p>The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The effectiveness of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules as a treatment for patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease was based on the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.</p><p><span class="Bold">24-week Study of Memantine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules</span></p><p>This was a randomized double-blind clinical investigation in outpatients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease (diagnosed by DSM-IV criteria and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for AD with a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≥ 3 and ≤ 14 at Screening and Baseline) receiving acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) therapy at a stable dose for 3 months prior to screening. The mean age of patients participating in this trial was 76.5 years with a range of 49-97 years. Approximately 72% of patients were female and 94% were Caucasian.</p><p><span class="Bold">Study Outcome Measures</span></p><p>The effectiveness of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules was evaluated in this study using the co-primary efficacy parameters of Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) and the Clinician’s Interview-Based Impression of Change (CIBIC-Plus).</p><p>The ability of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), a multi-item instrument that has been validated for the evaluation of cognitive function in patients with moderate to severe dementia. The SIB examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of attention, orientation, language, memory, visuospatial ability, construction, praxis, and social interaction. The SIB scoring range is from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment.</p><p>The ability of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules to produce an overall clinical effect was assessed using a Clinician’s Interview Based Impression of Change that required the use of caregiver information, the CIBIC-Plus. The CIBIC-Plus is not a single instrument and is not a standardized instrument like the ADCS-ADL or SIB. Clinical trials for investigational drugs have used a variety of CIBIC formats, each different in terms of depth and structure. As such, results from a CIBIC-Plus reflect clinical experience from the trial or trials in which it was used and cannot be compared directly with the results of CIBIC-Plus evaluations from other clinical trials. The CIBIC-Plus used in this trial was a structured instrument based on a comprehensive evaluation at baseline and subsequent time-points of four domains: general (overall clinical status), functional (including activities of daily living), cognitive, and behavioral. It represents the assessment of a skilled clinician using validated scales based on his/her observation during an interview with the patient, in combination with information supplied by a caregiver familiar with the behavior of the patient over the interval rated. The CIBIC-Plus is scored as a seven point categorical rating, ranging from a score of 1, indicating “marked improvement” to a score of 4, indicating “no change” to a score of 7, indicating “marked worsening.” The CIBIC-Plus has not been systematically compared directly to assessments not using information from caregivers (CIBIC) or other global methods.</p><p><span class="Bold">Study Results</span></p><p>In this study, 677 patients were randomized to one of the following 2 treatments: memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 28 mg/day or placebo while still receiving an AChEI (either donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine).</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on Severe Impairment Battery (SIB)</span></p><p>Figure 1 shows the time course for the change from baseline in SIB score for the two treatment groups completing the 24 weeks of the study. At 24 weeks of treatment, the mean difference in the SIB change scores for the memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsule 28 mg/AChEI-treated (combination therapy) patients compared to the patients on placebo/AChEI (monotherapy) was 2.6 units. Using an LOCF analysis, memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsule 28 mg/AChEI treatment was statistically significantly superior to placebo/AChEI.</p><p><span class="Italics">Figure 1: Time course of the change from baseline in SIB score for patients completing 24 weeks of treatment</span></p><p>Figure 2 shows the cumulative percentages of patients from each treatment group who had attained at least the measure of improvement in SIB score shown on the X axis. The curves show that both patients assigned to memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsule 28 mg/AChEI and placebo/AChEI have a wide range of responses, but that the memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsule 28 mg/AChEI group is more likely to show an improvement or a smaller decline.</p><p><span class="Italics">Figure 2: Cumulative percentage of patients completing 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with specified changes from baseline in SIB scores</span></p><p>Figure 3 shows the time course for the CIBIC-Plus score for patients in the two treatment groups completing the 24 weeks of the study.
