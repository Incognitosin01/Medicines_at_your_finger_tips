It is also found in meat and fish. Most creatine in the human body is stored in the muscles. Creatine is a source of energy for muscle contraction and is also involved in muscle growth.</p><p>Creatine has been used in alternative medicine as a possibly effective aid for enhancing athletic performance, and for increasing muscle strength in people with heart failure, muscular dystrophy, and McArdle's disease (a genetic disorder). It may also be possibly effective in treating Parkinson's disease, and gyrate atrophy (a genetic eye disorder that affects the retina and causes vision loss).</p><p>Creatine has also been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, or Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS). However, research has shown that it may not be effective in treating these conditions.</p><p>Other uses not proven with research have included treating high cholesterol, depression, bipolar disorder, or certain muscle diseases.</p><p>It is not certain whether creatine is effective in treating any medical condition. Medicinal use of this product has not been approved by the FDA. It should not be used in place of medication prescribed for you by your doctor.</p><p>Creatine is often sold as an herbal supplement. There are no regulated manufacturing standards in place for many herbal compounds and some marketed supplements have been found to be contaminated with toxic metals or other drugs. Herbal/health supplements should be purchased from a reliable source to minimize the risk of contamination.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Creatine has not been evaluated by the FDA for safety, effectiveness, or purity.

There have been instances where herbal/health supplements have been sold which were contaminated with toxic metals or other drugs. Herbal/health supplements should be purchased from a reliable source to minimize the risk of contamination.</p><p>Drink plenty of fluid while taking creatine. Although it has not been proven, dehydration, heat-related illnesses, muscle cramps, reduced blood volume, and electrolyte imbalances are expected to be more likely to occur while taking creatine.</p><p>Follow all directions on the product label and package.

High doses may cause harmful effects on your heart, kidneys, or liver.</p><p>Some athletes have used a "loading method" of taking creatine by using large doses for 2 to 5 days, followed by smaller "maintenance" doses. This method has been used by athletes seeking a short-term increase in athletic ability, such as before a sporting competition.</p><p>Another method of use involves taking smaller doses over an extended training period. This method has been used by people seeking endurance for long-term training such as body-building.</p><p>Creatine may be more effective if you take it with a meal of carbohydrates. Follow all directions on the product label.</p><p>Muscle tissues can only hold a certain amount of creatine. Using more of this product will not increase any effects.</p><p>Do not use different forms (tablets, liquid, powder, beverages, etc) of creatine at the same time without medical advice.
