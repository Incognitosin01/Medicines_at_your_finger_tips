It is used with other medicines to lower the body's natural immunity in patients who receive organ transplants (eg, kidney, heart, or liver).</p><p>When a patient receives an organ transplant, the body's white blood cells will try to get rid of (reject) the transplanted organ. Mycophenolate prevents the white blood cells from rejecting the transplanted organ.</p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using mycophenolate mofetil</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For mycophenolate mofetil, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to mycophenolate mofetil or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of mycophenolate in children receiving <i>kidney transplants</i>. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in infants younger than 3 months of age.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of mycophenolate in children receiving <i>heart or liver transplants</i>. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of mycophenolate in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving mycophenolate.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking mycophenolate mofetil, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using mycophenolate mofetil with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of mycophenolate mofetil</h2><p><i>Take mycophenolate mofetil exactly as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. Taking too much may increase the chance of side effects, while taking too little may lead to rejection of your transplanted organ.</p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>It is best to take mycophenolate mofetil on an empty stomach, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.</p><p>Mycophenolate <i>capsules</i> and <i>tablets</i> should be swallowed whole. Do not break, crush, open, or chew them.</p><p>It is important that you handle mycophenolate mofetil with care. Avoid inhaling the powder from the capsule or allowing the powder or the oral liquid to touch your skin or eyes. If the medicine gets on your skin, wash it thoroughly with soap and water. If the medicine gets in your eyes, wash them with plain water. Should a spill occur, wipe it up using paper towels wetted with water to remove the powder or liquid.</p><p>You should use the oral dispenser from the pharmacist to measure the correct amount of <i>suspension</i>. If you have any questions about this, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p><p>Use only the brand of mycophenolate <i>tablets</i> that your doctor ordered. Different brands may not work the same way.</p><p>If you are also using antacids that contain aluminum or magnesium (such as Maalox® or Mylanta®), do not use them at the same time as mycophenolate. Use them 1 hour before or 2 hours after your dose. If you have questions, talk with your doctor about the best times to use your medicines.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of mycophenolate mofetil will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of mycophenolate mofetil. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

Throw away any unused suspension after 60 days.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using mycophenolate mofetil</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i>. Your doctor will do blood tests to make sure that mycophenolate is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Using mycophenolate mofetil while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby or cause a miscarriage during the first 3 months. If you are a woman who can bear children, your doctor may give you a pregnancy test before you start using mycophenolate mofetil to make sure you are not pregnant. Your birth control pills may not work as well while you are using mycophenolate mofetil. You must use two forms of birth control together for 1 month before starting mycophenolate mofetil, for the entire time that you are being treated, and for 6 weeks after you receive your last dose of mycophenolate mofetil. Use birth control pills together with another form of birth control, such as a condom, diaphragm, or contraceptive foam or jelly. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Using mycophenolate mofetil may increase your risk of getting skin cancer or cancer of the lymph system (lymphoma). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.</p><p>Use sunscreen or sunblock lotions with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 on a regular basis when you are outdoors. Wear protective clothing and hats and stay out of direct sunlight, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Avoid sunlamps and tanning beds.</p><p>Mycophenolate can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, which increases the chance of getting an infection. If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you have a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</p><p>Mycophenolate may cause pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). This is a very rare condition where the body no longer makes red blood cells and the patient has severe anemia. Check with your doctor right away if you have a fever and sore throat, pale skin, unusual bleeding or bruising, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil may increase your risk of developing a serious and rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Check with your doctor right away if you are having more than one of these symptoms: vision changes, loss of coordination, clumsiness, memory loss, difficulty speaking or understanding what others say, and weakness in the legs.</p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil may increase your risk of developing rare and serious virus infections, such as shingles, herpes, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, polyomavirus associated nephropathy (PVAN), and BK virus-associated nephropathy (BKVAN). The BK virus may affect how your kidneys work and cause a transplanted kidney to fail. Check with your doctor right away if you are having more than one of these symptoms: bloody urine, a decreased frequency or amount of urine, increased thirst, loss of appetite, lower back or side pain, nausea, swelling of the face, fingers, or lower legs, trouble breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, vomiting, or weight gain.</p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil may cause reactivation of hepatitis B or C infection. Check with your doctor right away if you have the following symptoms while using mycophenolate mofetil: dark-colored urine or pale stools, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, pain in your upper stomach, yellow skin or eyes.</p><p>While you are using mycophenolate, and after you stop, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Mycophenolate will lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent.</p><p><i>Do not stop taking mycophenolate mofetil without checking first with your doctor</i>. Doing so may cause rejection of your transplanted organ. Your doctor will decide how long you should take mycophenolate mofetil.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Mycophenolate mofetil side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
