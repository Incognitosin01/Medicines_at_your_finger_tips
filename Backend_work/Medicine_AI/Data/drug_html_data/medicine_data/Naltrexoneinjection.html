Naltrexone can help keep you from feeling a "need" to use the opioid.</p><p>Naltrexone injection is also used to treat alcoholism by reducing your urge to drink alcohol. This may help you drink less or stop drinking altogether. You should not be drinking at the time you receive your first naltrexone injection.</p><p>Naltrexone is not a permanent cure for drug addiction or alcoholism.</p><p>Naltrexone may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should be treated with naltrexone <b>only if you have not recently used:</b> any opioid medicine, buprenorphine, methadone, or medicine to treat a cold, cough, diarrhea, or pain. Using these medicines in the 7 to 14 days before starting naltrexone can cause sudden opioid withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>Do not use opioid medication, heroin, or other street drugs while you are receiving naltrexone. Doing so could result in dangerous effects, including coma and death.</p><p>Call your doctor if you have ongoing or worsening pain, redness, itching, bruising, swelling, or a hard lump where the medicine was injected.</p><p>Naltrexone can harm your liver. Tell your doctor if you have upper stomach pain, dark urine, or yellowing in the whites of your eyes.</p><p>After receiving naltrexone, your body will be more sensitive to opioids if you use an opioid medicine in the future. Using the same amount you used before could lead to overdose or death.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p><b>You should not receive a naltrexone injection if you still use opioid medicine, or you could have sudden and severe withdrawal symptoms.</b></p><p>You should not be treated with naltrexone if you are allergic to it, or if:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>you are currently addicted to opioids;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you are having withdrawal symptoms from opioid addiction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have used any opioid medicine within the past 7 to 14 days (including fentanyl, Vicodin, OxyContin, and many others);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have used methadone or buprenorphine (Subutex, Butrans, Suboxone, Zubsolv) in the past 14 days; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have used any medicine to treat a cold, cough, diarrhea, or pain in the past 7 to 14 days.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>you are currently addicted to opioids;</p><p>you are having withdrawal symptoms from opioid addiction;</p><p>you have used any opioid medicine within the past 7 to 14 days (including fentanyl, Vicodin, OxyContin, and many others);</p><p>you have used methadone or buprenorphine (Subutex, Butrans, Suboxone, Zubsolv) in the past 14 days; or</p><p>you have used any medicine to treat a cold, cough, diarrhea, or pain in the past 7 to 14 days.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>liver disease;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kidney disease; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bleeding problems such as hemophilia.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>liver disease;</p><p>kidney disease; or</p><p>bleeding problems such as hemophilia.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><p>It is not known whether naltrexone will harm an unborn baby. However, <b>if you use opioid medicine while you are pregnant, your baby could become dependent on the drug.</b> This can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the baby after it is born. Babies born dependent on opioids may need medical treatment for several weeks.</p><h2>How is naltrexone given?</h2><p>Naltrexone is injected into a muscle. This injection is usually given once a month (every 4 weeks) and can be given only by a healthcare professional. Get your naltrexone injection regularly to get the most benefit.</p><p>You may notice pain, redness, itching, bruising, swelling, or a hard lump where the medicine was injected. Call your doctor if you have this type of reaction, especially if it gets worse or does not clear up within 2 weeks.</p><p>Naltrexone injections are only part of a complete treatment program that may also include additional forms of counseling and/or monitoring. Follow your doctor's instructions very closely.</p><p>In case of emergency, wear or carry medical identification to let others know you are using naltrexone.</p><p>After using naltrexone, your body will be more sensitive to opioids. If you use an opioid medicine in the future, you will need to use less than before naltrexone treatment. Using the same amount you used before could lead to overdose or death.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss an appointment for your naltrexone injection.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since  naltrexone is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur. However, overdose symptoms may include nausea, stomach pain, drowsiness, dizziness, or a reaction where an injection was given (such as severe pain or skin changes).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using naltrexone?</h2><p><b>Do not use opioid medication, heroin, or other street drugs while you are receiving naltrexone</b>. Once naltrexone is injected, it cannot be removed from your body. Never try to overcome the effects of naltrexone by taking large doses of opioids. Doing so could result in dangerous effects, including coma and death.</p><p>Ask your doctor before using any medicine to treat a cold, cough, diarrhea, or pain. These medicines may contain opioids and may not work as well while you are using naltrexone.</p><p>Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how this medicine will affect you. Dizziness or drowsiness can cause falls, accidents, or severe injuries.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Naltrexone side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction</b>: hives; chest pain, wheezing, difficult breathing; feeling light-headed; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Using opioid medicine while you are receiving naltrexone injections could stimulate opioid withdrawal symptoms.
