Low levels of collagenase AUX-I and AUX-II were quantifiable for up to 30 minutes following intralesional injection into a Peyronie plaque.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Dupuytren contracture:</b> Treatment of adults with Dupuytren contracture with a palpable cord</p><p><b>Peyronie disease:</b> Treatment of adult men with Peyronie disease with a palpable plaque and curvature deformity of at least 30 degrees at the start of therapy</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Treatment of Peyronie plaques that involve the penile urethra; history of hypersensitivity to collagenase or to collagenase used in any other therapeutic application or application method.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Dupuytren contracture:</b> Intralesional: Inject 0.58 mg per cord affecting a metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint or a proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. If contracture persists, finger extension procedure should be performed 24 to 72 hours following injection to facilitate cord disruption. If MP or PIP contracture remains, may reinject cord with a single dose of 0.58 mg 4 weeks following initial injection; injections and finger extension procedures may be administered up to 3 times per cord separated by ~4 week intervals. <b>Note:</b> Up to 2 injections per hand may be used during a treatment; 2 palpable cords affecting 2 joints or 1 palpable cord affecting 2 joints in the same finger may be injected at 2 locations during a treatment. Other palpable cords with contractures of MP or PIP joints may be injected at other treatment visits ~4 weeks apart.</p><p><b>Peyronie disease:</b> Intralesional: Males: Inject 0.58 mg into a Peyronie plaque; repeat injection 1 to 3 days later. A penile modeling procedure should be performed 1 to 3 days after the second injection. Administer a second treatment cycle (two 0.58 mg injections and a penile modeling procedure) in ~6 weeks if needed (maximum, 4 treatment cycles [a total of 8 injection procedures and 4 penile modeling procedures]); subsequent treatment cycles should not be administered if the curvature deformity is &lt;15 degrees after a treatment cycle or health care provider determines further treatment is not indicated. The safety of more than 1 treatment course (ie, 4 treatment cycles) is not known. <b>Note:</b> If more than 1 plaque is present, inject into the plaque causing the curvature deformity.</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy: </b>Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Lyophilized powder must be reconstituted with the provided diluent. Allow powder and diluent to warm to room temperature for at least 15 minutes and no longer than 60 minutes prior to reconstitution. Volume needed for reconstitution is dependent on intended site of injection. Using a 1 mL syringe with 0.01 graduations and a 27-gauge <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-inch needle, reconstitute powder (containing 0.9 mg collagenase clostridium histolyticum) with the following volume of diluent:</p><p><i>Cords affecting MP joints or Peyronie plaque:</i> Dilute with 0.39 mL diluent; provides 0.58 mg/0.25 mL concentration; inject diluent slowly into the sides of the vial and swirl to dissolve; do not invert vial or shake</p><p><i>Cords affecting PIP joints:</i> Dilute with 0.31 mL diluent; provides 0.58 mg/0.20 mL concentration; inject diluent slowly into the sides of the vial and swirl to dissolve; do not invert vial or shake</p><p>Each vial is for a single injection; if two joints on the same hand are to be treated during a treatment, use separate vials and syringes for each reconstitution and injection.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Inject intralesionally into a palpable cord or plaque using a 1 mL syringe with 0.01 mL graduations with a 27-gauge <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-inch needle. If reconstituted solution is refrigerated, warm to room temperature for ~15 to 60 minutes before use. Refer to product labeling for additional administration details. </p><p>Dupuytren contracture: Divide dose into 3 injections; after correct needle placement, inject <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of the dose, then reposition the needle in a distal location ~2 to 3 mm from the initial injection for the second injection (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of the dose), followed by the final injection (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of the dose) positioned ~2 to 3 mm proximal to the initial injection. To avoid tendon rupture when injecting a cord affecting a PIP joint of the fifth finger, needle insertion should not be &gt;2 to 3 mm in depth or &gt;4 mm distal to the palmar digital crease. Do not administer local anesthetic agent prior to administration due to possible interference with proper needle placement. When administering two injections in the same hand during a treatment, begin with the affected finger in the most medial aspect of the hand and continue toward the lateral aspect (eg, fifth finger to index finger). When administering two injections in a cord affecting two joints in the same finger, begin with the affected joint in the most proximal aspect of the finger and continue toward the distal aspect (eg, MP to PIP).</p><p>Peyronie disease: Local anesthetic may be administered prior to injection. The penis should be in a flaccid state before injection. The first injection should be into the plaque at the point of maximum concavity (or focal point) in the bend of the penis; second injection of each treatment cycle should be made ~2 to 3 mm apart from the first injection. Inject only into the plaque; avoid injection into the urethra, nerves, blood vessels, corpora cavernosa, or other collagen-containing structures of the penis to avoid damage to these structures and possible corporal rupture. Do not advance the needle beneath the plaque or perpendicularly towards the corpora cavernosum. Withdraw the needle slowly to deposit the full dose along the needle track within the plaque.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Prior to use, store lyophilized powder and diluent refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F); do not freeze. Once reconstituted, may be stored at room temperature 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) for ≤1 hour or refrigerated 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for ≤4 hours. Discard any unused reconstituted solution.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Agents with Antiplatelet Properties (e.g., P2Y12 inhibitors, NSAIDs, SSRIs, etc.): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Collagenase (Systemic).
