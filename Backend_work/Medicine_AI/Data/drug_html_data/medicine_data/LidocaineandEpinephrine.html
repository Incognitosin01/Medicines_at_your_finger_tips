When a more pronounced hemostasis is required, use a 1:50,000 epinephrine concentration. Do not exceed 7 mg/kg body weight, up to a maximum range of 300 mg (usual dental practice) to 500 mg (approved product labeling) of lidocaine and 3 mcg (0.003 mg) of epinephrine/kg of body weight or 0.2 mg epinephrine per dental appointment.</p><p><b>Epidural:</b> Administer a test dose (eg, 2 to 3 mL of lidocaine 1.5%) at least 5 minutes prior to injecting the total volume required for a lumbar or caudal block. Dosage varies with the number of dermatomes to be anesthetized (generally 2 to 3 mL of lidocaine 1%, 1.5%, or 2% with epinephrine [1:200,000] per dermatome). For continuous epidural or caudal anesthesia, the maximum dose should not be administered at intervals of &lt;90 minutes. Maximum total dose for paracervical block: 200 mg/90 minutes (50% of the total dose to each side, with 5 minutes between sides).</p><p><b>Local:</b> Infiltration: Dosage varies with procedure, degree of anesthesia needed, vascularity of tissue, duration of anesthesia required, and physical condition of patient. Maximum dose of lidocaine: 7 mg/kg (up to 500 mg). Use lidocaine 1%, 1.5%, or 2% with epinephrine (1:200,000) as single dose units.</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b>Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing; use with caution and at reduced dosages.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Note: </b>Dose varies with procedure, depth of anesthesia, vascularity of tissues, duration of anesthesia, and condition of patient should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of anesthetics. Dosing units variable (mL/kg, <b>mg/kg</b>); use extra precaution to ensure accuracy.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Dosing should be based on lean body mass (Cote 2013). Due to shorter duration of action and potential toxicity with repeat dosing, lidocaine is not typically used for central (spinal) or regional (epidural/caudal) anesthesia (Cote 2013; Miller 2015).</p><p><b>Local anesthesia; dermal/cutaneous infiltration: </b>Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Usual concentration ≤2% (eg, 1% or 2%) solution: Infiltrate area locally; maximum dose is 7 mg/kg, not to exceed adult maximum dose of 500 mg (Cote 2013; Kliegman 2016). <b>Note:</b> Aspiration should be performed prior to each injection; however, absence of blood in the syringe does not guarantee that intravascular injection has been avoided (Mulroy 2010).</p><p><b>Peripheral nerve block; excluding digital or penile:</b> Infants ≥6 months, Children, and Adolescents: Usual concentrations ≤1%: Dosage (concentration [0.25, 0.5 or 1%]) and volume varies with procedure, degree of anesthesia needed, vascularity of tissue, duration of anesthesia required, and physical condition of patient. Maximum dose of lidocaine: 7 mg/kg, not to exceed adult maximum of 500 mg (Cote 2013; Kliegman 2016). For infants &lt;6 months, maximum doses should be reduced by 30% (Cote 2013; Miller 2015).</p><p><b>Dental anesthesia; oral infiltration/mandibular block:</b> <b>Note:</b> For most routine dental procedures, lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 1:100,000 is preferred. When a more pronounced hemostasis is required, a 1:50,000 epinephrine concentration should be used.</p><p>Children &lt;10 years: Lidocaine 2% with epinephrine solution: ≤0.9 to 1 mL (lidocaine 18 mg to 20 mg) per procedure; maximum dose: 4.4 mg/kg not to exceed 300 mg (AAPD 2009); dosing is for procedures involving a single tooth, maxillary infiltration for 2 to 3 teeth, or mandibular block of an entire quadrant; it is rare that a patient would require a higher dose (ie, &gt;1 mL)</p><p>Children ≥10 years and Adolescents: Lidocaine 2% with epinephrine solution: Initial: 1 to 5 mL (lidocaine 20 mg to 100 mg). Do not exceed usual dental guideline recommended maximum dose of 4.4 mg/kg up to a maximum total dose of 300 mg (AAPD 2009); some suggest a higher maximum of 7 mg/kg up to total maximum of 500 mg (approved product labeling) of lidocaine and 3 mcg (0.003 mg) of epinephrine/kg of body weight or 0.2 mg epinephrine per dental appointment.</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Avoid intravascular injections. Aspirate the syringe after tissue penetration and before injection to minimize chance of direct vascular injection. Use with caution or avoid use when there is inflammation and/or sepsis in the region of the proposed injection. Do not use injections containing preservatives (eg, methylparaben) for epidural or spinal anesthesia, or for any route of administration that would introduce solution into the cerebrospinal fluid.

Treatment is primarily symptomatic and supportive.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Anaphylactic reactions may occur following administration.</p><p>• Intra-articular infusion related chondrolysis: Continuous intra-articular infusion of local anesthetics after arthroscopic or other surgical procedures is <b>not</b> an approved use; chondrolysis (primarily in the shoulder joint) has occurred following infusion, with some cases requiring arthroplasty or shoulder replacement.</p><p>• Methemoglobinemia: Has been reported with local anesthetics; clinically significant methemoglobinemia requires immediate treatment along with discontinuation of the anesthetic and other oxidizing agents. Onset may be immediate or delayed (hours) after anesthetic exposure. Patients with G6PD deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites, or infants &lt;6 months of age are more susceptible and should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia (eg, cyanosis, headache, rapid pulse, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, fatigue).</p><p>• Respiratory arrest: Local anesthetics have been associated with occurrences of respiratory arrest.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with bradycardia, severe shock, heart block, or impaired cardiovascular function; use with caution in areas of the body supplied by end arteries or having otherwise compromised blood supply. Patients with peripheral vascular disease or hypertensive vascular disease may exhibit exaggerated vasoconstrictor response. Ischemic injury (eg, exfoliating, ulcerating lesions) or necrosis may result.</p><p>• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; lidocaine is hepatically metabolized and patients with severe hepatic impairment are at greater risk of lidocaine toxicity.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (lidocaine metabolites may accumulate).</p><p>• Thyroid disease: Use with caution in patients with poorly controlled hyperthyroidism.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Acutely ill patients: Use with caution in acutely ill; reduce dose consistent with age and physical status.</p><p>• Debilitated patients: Use with caution in debilitated patients; reduce dose consistent with age and physical status.</p><p>• Elderly: Use with caution in the elderly; reduce dose consistent with age and physical status.</p><p>• Pediatric: Use with caution in children; reduce dose consistent with age and physical status.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension and cardiovascular collapse (AAP 1997; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol with caution in neonates See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><p>• Sodium metabisulfite: May contain sodium metabisulfite; use caution in patients with a sulfite allergy.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Avoid intravascular injections. Aspirate the syringe prior to administration; the needle must be repositioned until no return of blood can be elicited by aspiration; however, absence of blood in the syringe does not guarantee that intravascular injection has been avoided. Use with caution when there is inflammation and/or sepsis in the region of the proposed injection. Do not use injections containing preservatives (eg, methylparaben) for epidural or spinal anesthesia, or for any route of administration that would introduce solution into the cerebrospinal fluid.</p><p>• Epidural anesthesia: Use lumbar and caudal epidural anesthesia with extreme caution in patients with existing neurological disease, spinal deformities, septicemia, and impaired cardiovascular function (eg, severe hypertension).</p><p>• Repeat doses: Repeat doses of lidocaine may cause significant increases in blood levels with each repeated dose due to slow accumulation of the drug or its metabolites. Tolerance to elevated blood levels varies with the status of the patient.</p><p>• Trained personnel: Dental practitioners and/or clinicians using local anesthetic agents should be well trained in diagnosis and management of emergencies that may arise from the use of these agents. Resuscitative equipment, oxygen, and other resuscitative drugs should be available for immediate use.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Vital signs; ECG during administration of a test dose; state of consciousness after each injection; CNS toxicity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
