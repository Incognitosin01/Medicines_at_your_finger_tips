</ul><p class="First">GVOKE is indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above.</p><h2>Gvoke Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">2.1 Important Administration Instructions</span></p><p>GVOKE auto-injector and pre-filled syringe are for subcutaneous injection only.</p><p>Instruct patients and their caregivers on the signs and symptoms of severe hypoglycemia. Because severe hypoglycemia requires the help of others to recover, instruct the patient to inform those around them about GVOKE and its Instructions for Use. Administer GVOKE as soon as possible when severe hypoglycemia is recognized.</p><p>Instruct the patient or caregiver to read the Instructions for Use at the time they receive a prescription for GVOKE. Emphasize the following instructions to the patient or caregiver:</p><ul>
<li>Do not open foil pouch until ready to administer GVOKE.</li>
<li>Administer GVOKE according to the printed instructions on the foil pouch label, carton, or the Instructions for Use.</li>
<li>Visually inspect GVOKE prior to administration. The solution should appear clear and colorless to pale yellow and be free of particles. If the solution is discolored or contains particulate matter, do not use.</li>
<li>Administer the injection in the lower abdomen, outer thigh, or outer upper arm.</li>
<li>Call for emergency assistance immediately after administering the dose.</li>
<li>When the patient has responded to treatment, give oral carbohydrates to restore the liver glycogen and prevent recurrence of hypoglycemia.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to reuse GVOKE. Each GVOKE device contains a single dose of glucagon and cannot be reused.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">2.2 Dosage in Adults and Pediatric Patients Aged 2 years and Above</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Adults and Pediatric Patients Aged 12 and Older</span></p><ul>
<li>The recommended dose of GVOKE is 1 mg administered by subcutaneous injection into lower abdomen, outer thigh, or outer upper arm.</li>
<li>If there has been no response after 15 minutes, an additional 1 mg dose of GVOKE from a new device may be administered while waiting for emergency assistance.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to Under 12 Years of Age</span></p><ul>
<li>The recommended dose for pediatric patients who weigh less than 45 kg is 0.5 mg GVOKE administered by subcutaneous injection into the lower abdomen, outer thigh, or outer upper arm.</li>
<li>The recommended dose for pediatric patients who weigh 45 kg or greater is 1 mg GVOKE administered by subcutaneous injection into the lower abdomen, outer thigh, or outer upper arm.</li>
<li>If there has been no response after 15 minutes, an additional weight appropriate dose of GVOKE from a new device may be administered while waiting for emergency assistance.</li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Gvoke Injection is a clear, colorless to pale yellow solution available as follows:</p><ul>
<li>0.5 mg/0.1 mL single-dose pre-filled HypoPen auto-injector</li>
<li>1 mg/0.2 mL single-dose pre-filled HypoPen auto-injector</li>
<li>0.5 mg/0.1 mL single-dose pre-filled syringe</li>
<li>1 mg/0.2 mL single-dose pre-filled syringe</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">GVOKE is contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul>
<li>Pheochromocytoma [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions</span><span class="Italics">( 5.1)</span> ]</li>
<li>Insulinoma [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)</span> ] because of the risk of hypoglycemia</li>
<li>Known hypersensitivity to glucagon or to any of the excipients in GVOKE. Allergic reactions have been reported with glucagon and include anaphylactic shock with breathing difficulties and hypotension [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)</span> ].</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">5.1 Catecholamine Release in Patients with Pheochromocytoma</span></p><p>GVOKE is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma because glucagon may stimulate the release of catecholamines from the tumor [ <span class="Italics">see Contraindications ( 4)</span> ]. If the patient develops a dramatic increase in blood pressure and a previously undiagnosed pheochromocytoma is suspected, 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate, administered intravenously, has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure.</p><p><span class="Bold">5.2 Hypoglycemia in Patients with Insulinoma</span></p><p>In patients with insulinoma, administration of glucagon may produce an initial increase in blood glucose; however, glucagon administration may directly or indirectly (through an initial rise in blood glucose) stimulate exaggerated insulin release from an insulinoma and cause hypoglycemia. GVOKE is contraindicated in patients with insulinoma [ <span class="Italics">see Contraindications ( 4)</span> ]. If a patient develops symptoms of hypoglycemia after a dose of GVOKE, give glucose orally or intravenously.</p><p><span class="Bold">5.3 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions</span></p><p>Allergic reactions have been reported with glucagon, these include generalized rash, and in some cases anaphylactic shock with breathing difficulties and hypotension. GVOKE is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications ( 4)</span> ].</p><p><span class="Bold">5.4 Lack of Efficacy in Patients with Decreased Hepatic Glycogen</span></p><p>GVOKE is effective in treating hypoglycemia only if sufficient hepatic glycogen is present. Patients in states of starvation, with adrenal insufficiency or chronic hypoglycemia may not have adequate levels of hepatic glycogen for GVOKE administration to be effective. Patients with these conditions should be treated with glucose.</p><p><span class="Bold">5.5 Necrolytic Migratory Erythema</span></p><p>Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME), a skin rash commonly associated with glucagonomas (glucagon-producing tumors) and characterized by scaly, pruritic erythematous plaques, bullae, and erosions, has been reported postmarketing following continuous glucagon infusion. NME lesions may affect the face, groin, perineum and legs or be more widespread. In the reported cases NME resolved with discontinuation of the glucagon, and treatment with corticosteroids was not effective. Should NME occur, consider whether the benefits of continuous glucagon infusion outweigh the risks.</p><p><span class="Bold">5.6 Hypoglycemia in Patients with Glucagonoma</span></p><p>Glucagon administered to patients with glucagonoma may cause secondary hypoglycemia. Test patients suspected of having glucagonoma for blood levels of glucagon prior to treatment, and monitor for changes in blood glucose levels during treatment. If a patient develops symptoms of hypoglycemia after a dose of Glucagon for Injection, give glucose orally or intravenously.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in labeling:</p><ul>
<li>Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)</span> ].</li>
<li>Necrolytic Migratory Erythema [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5)</span> ].</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">6.1 Clinical Trials Experience</span></p><p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of GVOKE cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of other drugs and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients</span></p><p>The safety of GVOKE was evaluated in two randomized, blinded, 2-way crossover studies conducted in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus. In total, 154 patients received an injection of GVOKE [ <span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (</span>14.1<span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>The most common adverse reactions occurring in 2% or more of adult subjects treated with GVOKE during clinical trials are listed in Table 1.</p><p class="First">GVOKE 1 mg dose</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">7.1 Beta-Blockers</span></p><p>Patients taking beta-blockers may have a transient increase in pulse and blood pressure when given GVOKE.</p><p><span class="Bold">7.2 Indomethacin</span></p><p>In patients taking indomethacin, GVOKE may lose its ability to raise blood glucose or may even produce hypoglycemia.</p><p><span class="Bold">7.3 Warfarin</span></p><p>GVOKE may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">8.1 Pregnancy</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available data from case reports and a small number of observational studies with glucagon use in pregnant women over decades of use have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Multiple small studies have demonstrated a lack of transfer of pancreatic glucagon across the human placental barrier during early gestation. In a rat reproduction study, no embryofetal toxicity was observed with glucagon administered by injection during the period of organogenesis at doses representing up to 40 times the human dose, based on body surface area (mg/m2) (see Data).</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In pregnant rats given animal sourced glucagon twice-daily by injection at doses up to 2 mg/kg (up to 40 times the human dose based on body surface area extrapolation, mg/m2) during the period of organogenesis, there was no evidence of increased malformations or embryofetal lethality.</p><p><span class="Bold">8.2 Lactation</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information available on the presence of glucagon in human or animal milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. However, glucagon is a peptide and would be expected to be broken down to its constituent amino acids in the infant's digestive tract and is therefore, unlikely to cause harm to an exposed infant.</p><p><span class="Bold">8.4 Pediatric Use</span></p><p>The safety and effectiveness of GVOKE for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes have been established in pediatric patients ages 2 years and above. Use of GVOKE for this indication is supported by evidence from a study in 31 pediatric patients ages 2 and older with type 1 diabetes mellitus [ <span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (</span>14.2<span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of GVOKE have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age.</p><p><span class="Bold">8.5 Geriatric Use</span></p><p>Clinical studies of GVOKE did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Limited clinical trial experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">If overdosage occurs, the patient may experience nausea, vomiting, inhibition of GI tract motility, increase in blood pressure, and pulse rate. In case of suspected overdosing, serum potassium may decrease and should be monitored and corrected if needed. If the patient develops a dramatic increase in blood pressure, phentolamine mesylate has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure for the short time that control would be needed.</p><h2>Gvoke Injection Description</h2><p class="First">GVOKE contains glucagon, an antihypoglycemic agent used to treat severe hypoglycemia. Glucagon is a single chain containing 29 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 3483 and is identical to human glucagon. Glucagon is produced by solid phase synthesis with subsequent purification.</p><p>Its molecular formula is C <span class="Sub">153</span>H <span class="Sub">225</span>N <span class="Sub">43</span>O <span class="Sub">49</span>S with the following structure:</p><p></p><p>GVOKE is a clear, colorless to pale yellow, sterile solution for subcutaneous injection available in 0.5 mg per 0.1 mL or 1 mg per 0.2 mL auto-injector or pre-filled syringe.</p><p>Each 0.2 mL of GVOKE contains 1 mg of glucagon, 11.1 mg of trehalose dihydrate USP and 1.2 mg of 1N sulfuric acid, NF in dimethyl sulfoxide diluent.</p><p>Each 0.1 mL of GVOKE contains 0.5 mg of glucagon, 5.6 mg of trehalose dihydrate USP and 0.6 mg of 1N sulfuric acid, NF in dimethyl sulfoxide diluent.</p><h2>Gvoke Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">12.1 Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>Glucagon increases blood glucose concentration by activating hepatic glucagon receptors, thereby stimulating glycogen breakdown and release of glucose from the liver. Hepatic stores of glycogen are necessary for glucagon to produce an antihypoglycemic effect.</p><p><span class="Bold">12.2 Pharmacodynamics</span></p><p>After administration of 1 mg GVOKE in adult patients with diabetes, the mean maximum glucose increase from baseline was 176 mg/dL.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Mean ± Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) Plasma Glucose vs. Time from 1 mg Gvoke Injection in Adult Subjects with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</span></p><p></p><p>In pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (2 to less than 18 years), the mean maximum glucose increase from baseline was 134 mg/dL (2 to less than 6 years), 145 mg/dL (6 to less than 12 years), and 123 mg/dL (12 to less than 18 years).</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2: Mean (± SEM) Plasma Glucose vs. Time from Gvoke Injection in Pediatric Subjects with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</span></p><p>​</p><p><span class="Bold">12.3 Pharmacokinetics</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Subcutaneous injection of 1 mg GVOKE in adult type 1 diabetes mellitus subjects resulted in a mean glucagon Cmax of 2481.3 pg/mL, tmax of 50 minutes and AUC0‑240min of 3454.6 pg*min/mL.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 3: Mean (± SEM) Plasma Glucagon Concentration vs. Time for 1 mg Gvoke Injection in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</span></p><p></p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The apparent volume of distribution was in the range of 137-2425 L.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>The half-life of GVOKE was determined to be 32 minutes.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Glucagon is extensively degraded in liver, kidney, and plasma.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Urinary excretion of intact glucagon has not been measured.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatrics</span></p><p>Subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mg GVOKE in subjects ages 2 to under 6 years resulted in a mean glucagon Cmax of 2300 pg/mL, tmax of 41 minutes, and AUC0‑180min of 1389 pg/mL*min. Subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mg GVOKE in subjects ages 6 to under 12 years resulted in a mean Cmax of 1600 pg/mL, median tmax of 34 minutes and AUC0‑180min of 1047 pg/mL*min. Subcutaneous injection of 1 mg GVOKE in subjects ages 12 to less than 18 years resulted in a mean Cmax of 1900 pg/mL, tmax of 51 minutes AUC0‑180min of 1343 pg/mL*min.

Recombinant glucagon was positive in the bacterial Ames assay. It was determined that an increase in colony counts was related to technical difficulties in running this assay with peptides. Studies in rats have shown that glucagon does not cause impaired fertility.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">14.1 Adult Patients Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</span></p><p>GVOKE was evaluated in adult patients aged 18 to 74 years with type 1 diabetes in two multi-center 2-way crossover studies, Study A was double-blinded with 80 patients, and Study B was single-blinded with 81 patients. Both studies involved 2 clinic visits 7 to 28 days apart, with random assignment to receive GVOKE 1 mg during one session and GEK 1 mg during the other. 154 subjects received an injection of GVOKE and 157 subjects received an injection of GEK. A total of 152 subjects received both GVOKE and GEK.</p><p>The efficacy of GVOKE was compared to GEK in subjects who were in a state of insulin‑induced hypoglycemia via insulin infusion with target plasma glucose less than 50 mg/dL. In Study A, mean plasma glucose at time of glucagon administration was 44.8 mg/dL and 45.2 mg/dL for GVOKE and GEK, respectively. In Study B, mean plasma glucose at time of glucagon administration was 47.7 mg/dL and 48.7 mg/dL for GVOKE and GEK, respectively.</p><p>Treatment ‘success’ was defined as plasma glucose increase from mean value at time of glucagon administration to absolute value greater than 70 mg/dL or relative increase of 20 mg/dL or greater, at 30 minutes after glucagon administration. In a pooled analysis of Study A and Study B, the proportion of patients who achieved treatment ‘success’ was 98.7 % in the GVOKE group and 100% in the GEK group and the comparison between groups met the pre-specified non-inferiority margin. A summary of treatment ‘success’ rates is shown in Table 3.</p><p>The mean time to treatment ‘success’ was 13.8 minutes in the GVOKE group and 10 minutes in the GEK group.</p><p class="First">152</p><p class="First">157</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Glucose criteria met- n (%)</span></p><p>Greater than 70 mg/dL</p><p class="First">74 (95%)</p><p class="First">79 (100%)</p><p class="First">76 (100%)</p><p class="First">78 (100%)</p><p class="First">150 (97%)</p><p class="First">157 (100%)</p><p>1 - Treatment success is defines as blood glucose greater than 70 mg/dL or an increase of blood glucose by 20 mg/dL or greater from baseline.

<li>If you have questions regarding the use of this product, talk to a healthcare provider or pharmacist.</li>
</ul><p>Make sure that relatives, close friends or caregivers know that if you become unconscious, they should call for emergency medical help right away. GVOKE PFS may have been prescribed so that relatives, close friends and caregivers can give the injection if you become hypoglycemic (severe low blood sugar) and are unable to take sugar by mouth. If you are unconscious, GVOKE PFS can be given while awaiting medical assistance.</p><p>Show your relatives, close friends or caregivers where you store GVOKE PFS and how to use it. They need to know how to use GVOKE PFS before an emergency situation happens.</p><p><span class="Bold">Indications for Use</span></p><p>GVOKE PFS is for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. Symptoms of severe hypoglycemia include unconsciousness, and seizures or convulsions.</p><p>Give GVOKE PFS if:</p><p>Milder cases of hypoglycemia should be treated promptly by eating sugar or a sugar-sweetened product. (See Information on Hypoglycemia for more information on the symptoms of low blood sugar.) GVOKE PFS will not work when taken by mouth (orally).</p><p><span class="Bold">Understanding GVOKE PFS</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Adult GVOKE PFS contains a 1 mg dose of glucagon and is in a foil pouch.

<li>confusion</li>
<li>seizures</li>
<li>unconsciousness</li>
<li>death</li>
</ul><p>The occurrence of early symptoms calls for quick and, if necessary, repeated administration of some form of carbohydrate. Patients should always carry a quick source of sugar, such as candy mints or glucose tablets. The prompt treatment of mild hypoglycemic symptoms can prevent severe hypoglycemic reactions. If the patient does not improve or if administration of carbohydrate is impossible, GVOKE PFS should be given or the patient should be treated with intravenous glucose by a medical professional.</p><p><span class="Bold">Possible Problems with GVOKE PFS Treatment</span></p><p>Common side effects in adults and pediatric patients are nausea and vomiting. The product may cause serious side effects including serious allergic reactions, fast heart beat and high blood pressure.</p><p>People may be allergic to glucagon or to one of the inactive ingredients in GVOKE PFS, or may experience fast heart-beat for a short while.</p><p>If you experience any other reactions that may have been caused by GVOKE PFS, please contact your healthcare provider.</p><p><span class="Bold">Important:</span></p><ul>
