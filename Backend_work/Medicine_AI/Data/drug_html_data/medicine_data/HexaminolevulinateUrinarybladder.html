Hexaminolevulinate is used to check for cancer cells in the bladder.</p><p>Hexaminolevulinate is to be used only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using hexaminolevulinate</h2><p>In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. Also, other things may affect test results. For this test, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to hexaminolevulinate or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of hexaminolevulinate in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of hexaminolevulinate in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this diagnostic test, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Receiving this diagnostic test with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of hexaminolevulinate</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you hexaminolevulinate in a hospital or clinic.

You may stand, sit, or move during this time. If you feel you cannot hold the medicine in the bladder for 1 hour, tell your doctor or nurse right away.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using hexaminolevulinate</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress closely</i> while you are receiving hexaminolevulinate.
