Each 100 mL contains 5 g Dextrose Hydrous, USP*, 260 mg Sodium Lactate (C<span class="Sub">3</span>H<span class="Sub">5</span>NaO<span class="Sub">3</span>), 141 mg Potassium Chloride, USP (KCl), 31 mg Magnesium Chloride, USP (MgCl<span class="Sub">2</span>•6H<span class="Sub">2</span>0), 20 mg Monobasic Potassium Phosphate, NF (KH<span class="Sub">2</span>PO<span class="Sub">4</span>), and 12 mg Sodium Chloride, USP (NaCl). It contains no antimicrobial agents. The pH is 5.0 (4.0 to 6.5).</p><p>5% Dextrose and Electrolyte No. 48 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) administered intravenously has value as a source of water, electrolytes, and calories. One liter has an ionic concentration of 25 mEq sodium, 20 mEq potassium, 3 mEq magnesium, 24 mEq chloride, 23 mEq lactate and 3 mEq phosphate (as HPO<span class="Sub">4</span><span class="Sup">2-</span>). The osmolarity is 348 mOsmol/L (calc). Normal physiologic osmolarity range is approximately 280 to 310 mOsmol/L. Administration of substantially hypertonic solutions (≥ 600 mOsmol/L) may cause vein damage. The caloric content is 180 kcal/L.</p><p>Dextrose is derived from corn.</p><p>The VIAFLEX plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride (PL 146 Plastic). The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period, e.g., di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), up to 5 parts per million. However, the safety of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies.</p><h2>Dextrose and Electrolyte No 48 - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">5% Dextrose and Electrolyte No. 48 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) has value as a source of water, electrolytes and calories.
