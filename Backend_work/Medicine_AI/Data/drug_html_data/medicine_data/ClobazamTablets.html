<li><span class="Bold">Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">The use of benzodiazepines, including clobazam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing clobazam and throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clobazam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clobazam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue clobazam or reduce the dosage <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></span></li>
</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Clobazam Tablets</h2><p class="First">Clobazam is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age or older.</p><h2>Clobazam Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosing Information</h3><p class="First">A daily dose of clobazam greater than 5 mg should be administered in divided doses twice daily; a 5 mg daily dose can be administered as a single dose. Dose patients according to body weight. Individualize dosing within each body weight group, based on clinical efficacy and tolerability. Each dose in Table 1 (e.g., 5 to 20 mg in ≤30 kg weight group) has been shown to be effective, although effectiveness increases with increasing dose <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. Do not proceed with dose escalation more rapidly than weekly, because serum concentrations of clobazam and its active metabolite require 5 and 9 days, respectively, to reach steady-state.</p><h3>Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Clobazam</h3><p class="First">To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, increased seizure frequency, and status epilepticus, use a gradual taper to discontinue clobazam or reduce the dosage. Taper by decreasing the total daily dose by 5-10 mg/day on a weekly basis until discontinued. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clobazam Tablet Oral Administration</span></p><p>Clobazam Tablets can be taken with or without food.<br/>
Clobazam Tablets can be administered whole, broken in half along the score, or crushed and mixed in applesauce.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustments in Geriatric Patients</h3><p class="First">Plasma concentrations at any given dose are generally higher in the elderly: proceed slowly with dose escalation. The starting dose should be 5 mg/day for all elderly patients. Then titrate elderly patients according to weight, but to half the dose presented in Table 1, as tolerated. If necessary and based upon clinical response, an additional titration to the maximum dose (20 mg/day or 40 mg/day, depending on weight) may be started on day 21 <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustments in CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizers</h3><p class="First">In CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, levels of N-desmethylclobazam, clobazam's active metabolite, will be increased. Therefore, in patients known to be CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, the starting dose should be 5 mg/day and dose titration should proceed slowly according to weight, but to half the dose presented in Table 1, as tolerated. If necessary and based upon clinical response, an additional titration to the maximum dose (20 mg/day or 40 mg/day, depending on the weight group) may be started on day 21 <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. There is no experience with clobazam in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (ESRD). It is not known if clobazam or its active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, is dialyzable <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Clobazam is hepatically metabolized; however, there are limited data to characterize the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Clobazam. For this reason, proceed slowly with dosing escalations. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-9), the starting dose should be 5 mg/day in both weight groups. Then titrate patients according to weight, but to half the dose presented in Table 1, as tolerated. If necessary and based upon clinical response, start an additional titration on day 21 to the maximum dose (20 mg/day or 40 mg/day, depending on the weight group). There is inadequate information about metabolism of clobazam in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore no dosing recommendation in those patients can be given <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.8), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Tablets: 10 mg and 20 mg with a functional score for oral administration.</p><p>Each clobazam tablet is white to off-white, oval tablet with a functional score on one side and either a “C” and “I” or a “C” and “II” debossed on the other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Clobazam is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients. Hypersensitivity reactions have included serious dermatological reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including clobazam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe clobazam concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when clobazam is used with opioids <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><h3>Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction</h3><p class="First">The use of benzodiazepines, including clobazam, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]</span>.</p><p>Before prescribing clobazam and throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of clobazam, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of clobazam along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.</p><h3>Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions</h3><p class="First">To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue clobazam or reduce the dosage <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><p>Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use.</p><p><span class="Bold">Acute Withdrawal Reactions</span></p><p>The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clobazam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clobazam after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome</span><br/>
In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Potentiation of Sedation from Concomitant Use with Central Nervous System Depressants</h3><p class="First">Since clobazam has a central nervous system (CNS) depressant effect, patients or their caregivers should be cautioned against simultaneous use with other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol, and cautioned that the effects of other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol may be potentiated <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Somnolence or Sedation</h3><p class="First">Clobazam causes somnolence and sedation. In clinical trials, somnolence or sedation was reported at all effective doses and was dose-related. </p><p>In general, somnolence and sedation begin within the first month of treatment and may diminish with continued treatment. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation, particularly with concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants. Prescribers should caution patients against engaging in hazardous activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating dangerous machinery or motor vehicles, until the effect of clobazam is known.</p><h3>Serious Dermatological Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported with clobazam in both children and adults during the postmarketing period.  Patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of SJS/TEN, especially during the first 8 weeks of treatment initiation or when re-introducing therapy. Clobazam should be discontinued at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</h3><p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including clobazam, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p><p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted relative risk 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p><p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p><p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.</p><p>Anyone considering prescribing clobazam or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p><p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Clinically significant adverse reactions that appear in other sections of the labeling include the following:</p><ul class="Disk">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>During its development for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with LGS, clobazam was administered to 333 healthy volunteers and 300 patients with a current or prior diagnosis of LGS, including 197 patients treated for 12 months or more. The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly and included single- and multiple-dose clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers and two double-blind studies in patients with LGS (Study 1 and 2) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. Only Study 1 included a placebo group, allowing comparison of adverse reaction rates on clobazam at several doses to placebo.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in an LGS Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial (Study 1)</span></p><p>The adverse reactions associated with clobazam treatment discontinuation in ≥1% of patients in decreasing order of frequency included lethargy, somnolence, ataxia, aggression, fatigue, and insomnia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Most Common Adverse Reactions in an LGS Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial (Study 1)</span></p><p>Table 3 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥5% of clobazam-treated patients (at any dose), and at a rate greater than placebo-treated patients, in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical study of adjunctive AED therapy for 15 weeks (Study 1).</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">These reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size; therefore, it is not possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Benzodiazepines interact at GABA<span class="Sub">A</span> sites, and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>CNS Depressants and Alcohol</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of clobazam with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and somnolence <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><p>Alcohol, as a CNS depressant, will interact with clobazam in a similar way and also increases clobazam's maximum plasma exposure by approximately 50%. Therefore, caution patients or their caregivers against simultaneous use with other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol, and caution that the effects of other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol may be potentiated <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Effect of Clobazam on Other Drugs</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hormonal Contraceptives</span></p><p>Clobazam is a weak CYP3A4 inducer. As some hormonal contraceptives are metabolized by CYP3A4, their effectiveness may be diminished when given with clobazam. Additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended when using clobazam <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6</span></p><p>Clobazam inhibits CYP2D6.

This may increase the risk of dose-related adverse reactions. Dosage adjustment of clobazam may be necessary when co-administered with strong CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole, fluvoxamine, ticlopidine) or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Registry</span><br/>
There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, such as clobazam, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking clobazam enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll-free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of clobazam in pregnant women. Available data suggest that the class of benzodiazepines is not associated with marked increases in risk for congenital anomalies. Although some early epidemiological studies suggested a relationship between benzodiazepine drug use in pregnancy and congenital anomalies such as cleft lip and/or palate, these studies had considerable limitations. More recently completed studies of benzodiazepine use in pregnancy have not consistently documented elevated risks for specific congenital anomalies. There is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of benzodiazepine pregnancy exposure on neurodevelopment.<br/>
<br/>
There are clinical considerations regarding exposure to benzodiazepines during the second and third trimester of pregnancy or immediately prior to or during childbirth. These risks include decreased fetal movement and/or fetal heart rate variability, “floppy infant syndrome,” dependence, and withdrawal [<span class="Italics">see </span><span class="Italics">Clinical Considerations </span><span class="Italics">and Human Data</span>].<br/>
<br/>
Administration of clobazam to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis or to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in developmental toxicity, including increased incidences of fetal malformations and mortality, at plasma exposures for clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, below those expected at therapeutic doses in patients [<span class="Italics">see Animal Data</span>]. Data for other benzodiazepines suggest the possibility of long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines at clinically relevant doses. Clobazam should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Advise a pregnant woman and women of childbearing age of the potential risk to a fetus.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</span>Infants born to mothers who have taken benzodiazepines during the later stages of pregnancy can develop dependence, and subsequently withdrawal, during the postnatal period. Clinical manifestations of withdrawal or neonatal abstinence syndrome may include hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hypoventilation, irritability, tremors, diarrhea, and vomiting. These complications can appear shortly after delivery to 3 weeks after birth and persist from hours to several months depending on the degree of dependence and the pharmacokinetic profile of the benzodiazepine. Symptoms may be mild and transient or severe. Standard management for neonatal withdrawal syndrome has not yet been defined. Observe newborns who are exposed to clobazam <span class="Italics">in utero</span> during the later stages of pregnancy for symptoms of withdrawal and manage accordingly.</p><p><span class="Italics">Labor and Delivery</span><br/>
Administration of benzodiazepines immediately prior to or during childbirth can result in a floppy infant syndrome, which is characterized by lethargy, hypothermia, hypotonia, respiratory depression, and difficulty feeding. Floppy infant syndrome occurs mainly within the first hours after birth and may last up to 14 days. Observe exposed newborns for these symptoms and manage accordingly.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span><br/>

Congenital Anomalies</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>Although there are no adequate and well controlled studies of clobazam in pregnant women, there is information about benzodiazepines as a class. Dolovich et al. published a meta-analysis of 23 studies that examined the effects of benzodiazepine exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. Eleven of the 23 studies included in the meta-analysis considered the use of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam and not other benzodiazepines. The authors considered case-control and cohort studies separately. The data from the cohort studies did not suggest an increased risk for major malformations (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.61—1.35) or for oral cleft (OR 1.19; 95% CI 0.34—4.15). The data from the case-control studies suggested an association between benzodiazepines and major malformations (OR 3.01; 95% CI 1.32—6.84) and oral cleft (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.13—2.82). The limitations of this meta-analysis included the small number of reports included in the analysis, and that most cases for analyses of both oral cleft and major malformations came from only three studies. A follow up to that meta-analysis included 3 new cohort studies that examined risk for major malformations and one study that considered cardiac malformations. The authors found no new studies with an outcome of oral clefts. After the addition of the new studies, the odds ratio for major malformations with first trimester exposure to benzodiazepines was 1.07 (95% CI 0.91—1.25).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Neonatal Withdrawal and Floppy Infant Syndrome</span></span><br/>
Neonatal withdrawal syndrome and symptoms suggestive of floppy infant syndrome associated with administration of clobazam during the later stages of pregnancy and peripartum period have been reported in the postmarketing experience. Findings in published scientific literature suggest that the major neonatal side effects of benzodiazepines include sedation and dependence with withdrawal signs. Data from observational studies suggest that fetal exposure to benzodiazepines is associated with the neonatal adverse events of hypotonia, respiratory problems, hypoventilation, low Apgar score, and neonatal withdrawal syndrome.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span><br/>
In a study in which clobazam (0, 150, 450, or 750 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to pregnant rats throughout the period of organogenesis, embryofetal mortality and incidences of fetal skeletal variations were increased at all doses. The low-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (150 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) for clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, lower than those in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg/day.</p><p>Oral administration of clobazam (0, 10, 30, or 75 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weights, and increased incidences of fetal malformations (visceral and skeletal) at the mid and high doses, and an increase in embryofetal mortality at the high dose. Incidences of fetal variations were increased at all doses. The highest dose tested was associated with maternal toxicity (ataxia and decreased activity). The low-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbits (10 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma exposures for clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam lower than those in humans at the MRHD.</p><p>Oral administration of clobazam (0, 50, 350, or 750 mg/kg/day) to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in increased embryofetal mortality at the high dose, decreased pup survival at the mid and high doses and alterations in offspring behavior (locomotor activity) at all doses. The low-effect dose for adverse effects on pre- and postnatal development in rats (50 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma exposures for clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam lower than those in humans at the MRHD.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
Clobazam is excreted in human milk. Postmarketing experience suggests that breastfed infants of mothers taking benzodiazepines, such as clobazam, may have effects of lethargy, somnolence and poor sucking. The effect of clobazam on milk production is unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for clobazam and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from clobazam or from the underlying maternal condition. If exposing a breastfed infant to clobazam, observe for any potential adverse effects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Monitoring for Adverse Reactions</span><br/>
Adverse reactions such as somnolence and difficult feeding have been reported in infants during breastfeeding in postmarketing experience with clobazam. Monitor breastfed infants for possible sedation and poor sucking.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span><br/>
Scientific literature on clobazam use during lactation is limited. After short-term administration, clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam are transferred into breast milk.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Administration of clobazam to rats prior to and during mating and early gestation resulted in adverse effects on fertility and early embryonic development at plasma exposures for clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, below those in humans at the MRHD <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology</span> (<span class="Italics">13.1)].</span><br/></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in patients less than 2 years of age have not been established.</p><p>In a study in which clobazam (0, 4, 36, or 120 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to rats during the juvenile period of development (postnatal days 14 to 48), adverse effects on growth (decreased bone density and bone length) and behavior (altered motor activity and auditory startle response; learning deficit) were observed at the high dose. The effect on bone density, but not on behavior, was reversible when drug was discontinued. The no-effect level for juvenile toxicity (36 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) to clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, less than those expected at therapeutic doses in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of clobazam did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, elderly subjects appear to eliminate clobazam more slowly than younger subjects based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. For these reasons, the initial dose in elderly patients should be 5 mg/day. Patients should be titrated initially to 10-20 mg/day. Patients may be titrated further to a maximum daily dose of 40 mg if tolerated <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizers</h3><p class="First">Concentrations of clobazam's active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, are higher in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers. For this reason, dosage modification is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of clobazam were evaluated in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. There were no significant differences in systemic exposure (AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) between patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. There is essentially no experience with clobazam in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD. It is not known if clobazam or its active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, is dialyzable <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Clobazam is hepatically metabolized; however, there are limited data to characterize the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clobazam. For this reason, dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-9). There is inadequate information about metabolism of clobazam in patients with severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Clobazam Tablets contain clobazam, a Schedule IV controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Clobazam is a benzodiazepine and a CNS depressant with a potential for abuse and addiction. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Even taking benzodiazepines as prescribed may put patients at risk for abuse and misuse of their medication. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines may lead to addiction.</p><p>Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Benzodiazepines are often sought by individuals who abuse drugs and other substances, and by individuals with addictive disorders <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p>The following adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: abdominal pain, amnesia, anorexia, anxiety, aggression, ataxia, blurred vision, confusion, depression, disinhibition, disorientation, dizziness, euphoria, impaired concentration and memory, indigestion, irritability, muscle pain, slurred speech, tremors, and vertigo.</p><p>The following severe adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: delirium, paranoia, suicidal ideation and behavior, seizures, coma, breathing difficulty, and death. Death is more often associated with polysubstance use (especially benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants such as opioids and alcohol).</p><p>The World Health Organization epidemiology database contains reports of drug abuse, misuse, and overdoses associated with clobazam.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Physical Dependence</span></p><p>Clobazam may produce physical dependence from continued therapy. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of benzodiazepines or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening. Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e., higher and/or more frequent doses) and those who have had longer durations of use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>. In clinical trials, cases of dependency were reported following abrupt discontinuation of clobazam.</p><p>To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue clobazam or reduce the dosage <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Acute Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms</span></p><p>Acute withdrawal signs and symptoms associated with benzodiazepines have included abnormal involuntary movements, anxiety, blurred vision, depersonalization, depression, derealization, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal adverse reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, decreased appetite), headache, hyperacusis, hypertension, irritability, insomnia, memory impairment, muscle pain and stiffness, panic attacks, photophobia, restlessness, tachycardia, and tremor. More severe acute withdrawal signs and symptoms, including life-threatening reactions, have included catatonia, convulsions, delirium tremens, depression, hallucinations, mania, psychosis, seizures, and suicidality.</p><p><span class="Italics">Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome</span></p><p>Protracted withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines is characterized by anxiety, cognitive impairment, depression, insomnia, formication, motor symptoms (e.g., weakness, tremor, muscle twitches), paresthesia, and tinnitus that persists beyond 4 to 6 weeks after initial benzodiazepine withdrawal. Protracted withdrawal symptoms may last weeks to more than 12 months. As a result, there may be difficulty in differentiating withdrawal symptoms from potential re-emergence or continuation of symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was being used.</p><p><span class="Bold">Tolerance</span></p><p>Tolerance to clobazam may develop from continued therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance to the therapeutic effect of clobazam may develop; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Signs and Symptoms of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">Overdose and intoxication with benzodiazepines, including clobazam, may lead to CNS depression, associated with drowsiness, confusion and lethargy, possibly progressing to ataxia, respiratory depression, hypotension, and, rarely, coma or death. The risk of a fatal outcome is increased in cases of combined poisoning with other CNS depressants, including opioids and alcohol.</p><h3>10.2 Management of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">The management of clobazam overdose may include gastric lavage and/or administration of activated charcoal, intravenous fluid replenishment, early control of airway and general supportive measures, in addition to monitoring level of consciousness and vital signs. Hypotension can be treated by replenishment with plasma substitutes and, if necessary, with sympathomimetic agents.</p><p>The efficacy of supplementary administration of physostigmine (a cholinergic agent) or of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) in clobazam overdose has not been assessed. The administration of flumazenil in cases of benzodiazepine overdose can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions. Its use in patients with epilepsy is typically not recommended.</p><h2>Clobazam Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Clobazam is a white or almost white, crystalline powder with a slightly bitter taste; is slightly soluble in water, sparingly soluble in ethanol, and freely soluble in methylene chloride. The melting range of clobazam is from 182ºC to 185ºC. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">16</span>H<span class="Sub">13</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>Cl and the molecular weight is 300.7.</p><p>Each clobazam tablet contains 10 mg or 20 mg of clobazam. Tablet also contains as inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, pregelatinized starch, colloidal silicon dioxide, talc, and magnesium stearate.</p><h2>Clobazam Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The exact mechanism of action for clobazam, a 1,5-benzodiazepine, is not fully understood but is thought to involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission resulting from binding at the benzodiazepine site of the GABA<span class="Sub">A</span> receptor.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on Electrocardiogram</span></p><p>The effect of clobazam 20 mg and 80 mg administered twice daily on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, evaluator-blinded, placebo-, and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) parallel thorough QT study in 280 healthy subjects. In a study with demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on the Fridericia correction method was below 10 ms, the threshold for regulatory concern. Thus, at a dose two times the maximum recommended dose, clobazam did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The peak plasma levels (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and the area under the curve (AUC) of clobazam are dose-proportional over the dose range of 10-80 mg following single- or multiple-dose administration of clobazam. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the pharmacokinetics of clobazam are linear from 5-160 mg/day. Clobazam is converted to N-desmethylclobazam which has about 1/5 the activity of clobazam. The estimated mean elimination half-lives (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam were 36-42 hours and 71-82 hours, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Clobazam is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration. The time to peak concentrations (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) of Clobazam Tablets under fasted conditions ranged from 0.5 to 4 hours after single- or multiple-dose administrations. The administration of Clobazam Tablets with food or when crushed in applesauce does not affect absorption.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Clobazam is lipophilic and distributes rapidly throughout the body. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state was approximately 100 L. The <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> plasma protein binding of clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam is approximately 80-90% and 70%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Excretion</span></p><p>Clobazam is extensively metabolized in the liver, with approximately 2% of the dose recovered in urine and 1% in feces as unchanged drug. The major metabolic pathway of clobazam involves N-demethylation, primarily by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and CYP2B6. N-desmethylclobazam, an active metabolite, is the major circulating metabolite in humans, and at therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations are 3-5 times higher than those of the parent compound. Based on animal and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> receptor binding data, estimates of the relative potency of N-desmethylclobazam compared to parent compound range from 1/5 to equal potency. N-desmethylclobazam is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP2C19. N-desmethylclobazam and its metabolites comprise ~94% of the total drug-related components in urine. Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled drug, approximately 11% of the dose was excreted in the feces and approximately 82% was excreted in the urine.</p><p>The polymorphic CYP2C19 is the major contributor to the metabolism of the pharmacologically active N-desmethylclobazam <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]</span>. In CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, levels of N-desmethylclobazam were 5-fold higher in plasma and 2- to 3-fold higher in the urine than in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Age</span></p><p>Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the clearance of clobazam is lower in elderly subjects compared to other age groups (ages 2 to 64).

There were insignificant changes in C<span class="Sub">max</span> (3-24%) and AUC (≤13%) for clobazam or N-desmethylclobazam in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. Patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD were not included in this study.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>There are limited data to characterize the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clobazam. In a small study, the pharmacokinetics of a 20 mg single oral dose of clobazam in 9 patients with liver impairment were compared to healthy controls (N=6). The C<span class="Sub">max</span> and the mean plasma clearance of clobazam, as well as the C<span class="Sub">max</span> of N-desmethylclobazam, showed no significant change compared to the healthy controls.
