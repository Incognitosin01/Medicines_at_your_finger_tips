<li>Brain tumors glioblastoma, brainstem glioma, medulloblastoma, astrocytoma, ependymoma, and metastatic brain tumors.</li>
<li>Multiple myeloma in combination with prednisone.</li>
<li>Relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma in combination with other approved drugs.</li>
<li>Relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in combination with other approved drugs.</li>
</ul><h2>Carmustine Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of Carmustine for Injection as a single agent in previously untreated patients is 150 to 200 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> intravenously every 6 weeks. Administer as a single dose or divided into daily injections such as 75 to 100 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> on two successive days. Lower the dose when Carmustine for Injection is used with other myelosuppressive drugs or in patients in whom bone marrow reserve is depleted. Administer Carmustine for Injection for the duration according to the established regimen. Premedicate each dose with anti-emetics.</p><p>Adjust doses subsequent to the initial dose according to the hematologic response of the patient to the preceding dose. The following schedule is suggested as a guide to dosage adjustment:</p><p>The hematologic toxicity can be delayed and cumulative. Monitor blood counts weekly. Do not administer a repeat course of Carmustine for Injection until circulating blood elements have returned to acceptable levels (platelets above 100 Gi/L, leukocytes above 4 Gi/L and absolute neutrophil count above 1 Gi/L). The usual interval between courses is 6 weeks.</p><p>Evaluate renal function prior to administration and periodically during treatment. For patients with compromised renal function, monitor for toxicity more frequently. Discontinue Carmustine for Injection if the creatinine clearance is less than 10 mL/min. Do not administer Carmustine for Injection to patients with compromised renal function. Monitor transaminases and bilirubin periodically during treatment. <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)].</span></p><h3>Preparation and Administration of Intravenous Solution</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Dissolve carmustine for injection with 3 mL of the supplied sterile diluent (Dehydrated Alcohol Injection, USP).</li>
<li>Aseptically add 27 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP.
<ul>

</ul><p class="First">Accidental contact of reconstituted carmustine for injection with the skin has caused transient hyperpigmentation of the affected areas. Wear impervious gloves to minimize the risk of dermal exposure impervious gloves when handling vials containing carmustine for injection. Immediately wash the skin or mucosa thoroughly with soap and water if carmustine for injection lyophilized material or solution contacts the skin or mucosa <span class="Sup">1</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">For injection: 100 mg of carmustine as a lyophilized powder in a single-dose vial for reconstitution and a vial containing 3 mL sterile diluent (Dehydrated Alcohol Injection, USP).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Carmustine for Injection is contraindicated in patients with previous hypersensitivity to carmustine or its components.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myelosuppression</h3><p class="First">Bone marrow toxicity is a dose-limiting, common and severe toxic effect of carmustine for injection occurring 4-6 weeks after drug administration (thrombocytopenia occurs at about 4 weeks post-administration persisting for 1 to 2 weeks; leukopenia occurs at 5 to 6 weeks after a dose of carmustine for injection persisting for 1 to 2 weeks; thrombocytopenia is generally more severe than leukopenia; anemia is less frequent and less severe compared to thrombocytopenia and/or leukopenia) Complete blood count should therefore be monitored weekly for at least six weeks after a dose. Repeat doses of carmustine for injection should not be given more frequently than every six weeks. The bone marrow toxicity of carmustine for injection is cumulative and therefore the dosage adjustment must be considered on the basis of nadir blood counts from prior dose [see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions</span> ( 6)] . Greater myelotoxicity (e.g., leukopenia and neutropenia) has been reported when carmustine was combined with cimetidine [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span> ( 7)] .</p><h3>Pulmonary Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Cases of fatal pulmonary toxicity with carmustine for injection have been reported. Pulmonary toxicity characterized by pulmonary infiltrates and/or fibrosis has been reported to occur from 9 days to 43 months after treatment with carmustine for injection and related nitrosoureas. Pulmonary toxicity from carmustine for injection is dose-related. Patients receiving greater than 1400 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> cumulative dose are at significantly higher risk than those receiving less. However, there have been reports of pulmonary fibrosis in patients receiving lower total doses. Interstitial fibrosis (with lower doses) occurred rarely. Additionally, delayed onset pulmonary fibrosis occurring up to 17 years after treatment has been reported in patients who received carmustine for injection (in cumulative doses ranging from 770 to 1800 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> combined with cranial radiotherapy for intracranial tumors) in childhood and early adolescence. Other risk factors include past history of lung disease and duration of treatment. Baseline pulmonary function studies should be conducted along with frequent pulmonary function tests during treatment. Patients with a baseline below 70% of the predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) or carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) are particularly at risk.</p><h3>Administration Reactions</h3><p class="First">Injection site reactions may occur during the administration of carmustine for injection. Rapid intravenous infusion of carmustine for injection may produce intensive flushing of the skin and suffusion of the conjunctiva within 2 hours, lasting about 4 hours. It is also associated with burning at the site of injection although true thrombosis is rare. Given the possibility of extravasation, close monitoring of the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration is recommended. A specific treatment for extravasation reactions is unknown at this time.</p><h3>Carcinogenicity</h3><p class="First">Long-term use of nitrosoureas, such as carmustine for injection, has been reported to be associated with the development of secondary malignancies. Carmustine was carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicity (13.1)]</span> . Nitrosourea therapy, such as carmustine for injection, has carcinogenic potential in humans. Patients treated with carmustine for injection should be monitored long-term for development of second malignancies.</p><h3>Ocular Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Carmustine for injection has been administered through an intraarterial intracarotid route; this procedure is investigational and has been associated with ocular toxicity. Safety and effectiveness of the intra-arterial route have not been established.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Carmustine was embryotoxic in rats and rabbits and teratogenic in rats when given in doses lower than the maximum cumulative human dose based on body surface area. There are no adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus [ <span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1, 8.3)</span> ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during and after treatment with carmustine for injection for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with carmustine for injection for at least 3 months after therapy <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1, 8.3)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

Limited available data with Carmustine for Injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. Carmustine was embryotoxic in rats and rabbits and teratogenic in rats (thoracoabdominal closure, neural tube, and eye defects and malformations of the skeletal system of the fetus) when given in doses lower than the maximum cumulative human dose based on body surface area. Consider the benefits and risks of Carmustine for Injection for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing Carmustine for Injection to a pregnant woman.</p><p>Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Intraperitoneal (IP) administration of carmustine to pregnant rats 14 days prior to mating and during the period of organogenesis at cumulative doses ≥ 26 mg/kg (158 mg/ m <span class="Sup">2</span>), approximately 0.1 times the maximum cumulative human dose of 1400 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>, resulted in pre-implantation loss, increased resorptions (including completely resorbed litters), and reduced the number of live births in the presence of maternal toxicity.</p><p>Carmustine administered IP to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at cumulative doses ≥ 4 mg/kg (24 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>), approximately 0.02 times the maximum cumulative human dose based on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis, resulted in reduced fetal weight and various malformations, which included thoracoabdominal closure defects, neural tube defects, and eye defects, including microphthalmia/anophthalmia, and skeletal anomalies in the skull, sternebra, vertebrae and ribs, and reduced skeletal ossification) in the presence of maternal toxicity. Embryo-fetal death was observed at cumulative doses ≥ 8 mg/kg (48 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>), approximately 0.03 times the maximum cumulative human dose on a mg/ m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Intravenous (IV) administration of carmustine to rats at a cumulative dose of 50 mg/kg (300 mg/ m <span class="Sup">2</span>), approximately 0.2 times the maximum cumulative human dose on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis, during the last quarter of pregnancy resulted in the death of offspring within 4 months. Carmustine administered IV to rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in spontaneous abortions in mothers and growth defects in the fetus, mainly at cumulative doses ≥ 13 mg/kg (156 mg/ m <span class="Sup">2</span>), approximately 0.1 times the maximum cumulative human dose on a mg/ m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of carmustine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse events (e.g., carcinogenicity and myelosuppression) in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued while taking Carmustine for Injection.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Contraception</span></p><p>Advise female patients to avoid pregnancy during treatment with carmustine for injection because of the risk of fetal harm <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span> .</p><p>Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during and for up to six months after completion of treatment.</p><p>Advise males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during carmustine for injection treatment and for at least three months after the final dose of carmustine for injection [ <span class="Italics">see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p>Based on nonclinical findings, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with carmustine for injection  <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. Delayed onset pulmonary fibrosis occurring up to 17 years after treatment has been reported in a long-term study of patients who received carmustine for injection in childhood and early adolescence (1-16 years). Eight out of the 17 patients (47%) who survived childhood brain tumors, including all the 5 patients initially treated at less than 5 years of age, died of pulmonary fibrosis. <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of carmustine for injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dose range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>Carmustine for injection and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and renal function should be monitored.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The main result of overdose is myeloablation. No proven antidotes have been established for Carmustine for Injection overdosage.</p><h2>Carmustine Injection Description</h2><p class="First">The active ingredient in Carmustine for injection, USP is a nitrosourea with the chemical name 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea and a molecular weight of 214.06. The drug product is supplied as sterile lyophilized pale yellow flakes or a congealed mass, and it is highly soluble in alcohol and lipids, and poorly soluble in water. Carmustine for Injection, USP is administered by intravenous infusion after reconstitution, as recommended.</p><p>The structural formula of carmustine is:</p><p></p><p>Carmustine for Injection, USP is available in 100-mg single dose vials of lyophilized material. Sterile diluent for constitution of Carmustine for Injection, USP is co-packaged with the active drug product for use in constitution of the lyophile. The diluent is supplied in a vial containing 3 mL of Dehydrated Alcohol Injection, USP.</p><h2>Carmustine Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of carmustine is not fully understood. While carmustine alkylates DNA and RNA, it is not cross-resistant with other alkylators. As with other nitrosoureas, it may also inhibit several key enzymatic processes by carbamoylation of amino acids in proteins. The metabolites may contribute to antitumor activity and toxicities of carmustine.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The exposure-response relationship for efficacy or safety is unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Carmustine crosses the blood-brain barrier.
