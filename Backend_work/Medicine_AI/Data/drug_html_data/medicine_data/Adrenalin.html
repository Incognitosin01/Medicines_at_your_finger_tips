You may need to use epinephrine during pregnancy or while you are breast-feeding. <b>Seek emergency medical attention right away after using the injection.</b></p><p>In an emergency, you may not be able to tell caregivers if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Make sure any doctor caring for your pregnancy or your baby knows you received this medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use  Adrenalin?</h2><p>Epinephrine is injected into the skin or muscle of your outer thigh. In an emergency, this injection can be given through your clothing.</p><p>Epinephrine is sometimes given as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give you this type of injection.</p><p><b>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine.</b> Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>The auto-injector device is a disposable single-use system. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Do not give this medicine to a child without medical advice.</p><p>Do not remove the safety cap until you are ready to use the auto-injector. Never put your fingers over the injector tip after the safety cap has been removed.</p><p>To use an epinephrine auto-injector:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Form a fist around the auto-injector with the tip pointing down. Pull off the safety cap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the tip against the fleshy portion of the outer thigh. You may give the injection directly through clothing. Hold the leg firmly when giving this injection to a child or infant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Push the auto-injector firmly against the thigh to release the needle that injects the dose of epinephrine. Hold the auto-injector in place for 10 seconds after activation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the auto-injector from the thigh and massage the area gently. Carefully re-insert the used device needle-first into the carrying tube. Re-cap the tube and take it with you to the emergency room so that anyone who treats you will know how much epinephrine you have received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an auto-injector only one time. Do not try to reinsert an auto-injector a second time if the needle has come out of your skin before the full 10 seconds. If the needle is bent from the first use, it may cause serious injury to your skin.</p>

You will need to receive further treatment and observation.</p><p>Also seek emergency medical attention if you accidentally inject yourself while giving epinephrine to another person.</p><p>Your medicine may also come with a "trainer pen."
