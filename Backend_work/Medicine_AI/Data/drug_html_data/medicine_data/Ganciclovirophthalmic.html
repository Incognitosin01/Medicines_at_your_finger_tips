The implant will slowly release ganciclovir into the affected eye over a period of 5 to 8 months.</p><p>Use Zirgan gel exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not use in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label.</p><p>Zirgan is usually applied 5 times each day until your eye ulcer heals. Then the gel is applied 3 times per day for 7 days. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Wash your hands before using the eye drops.</p><p>To apply Zirgan:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Tilt your head back slightly and pull down your lower eyelid to create a small pocket. Hold the dropper above the eye with the tip down. Look up and away from the dropper as you squeeze out a drop, then close your eye.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use only the number of drops your doctor has prescribed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gently press your finger to the inside corner of the eye (near your nose) for about 1 minute to keep the liquid from draining into your tear duct. If you use more than one drop in the same eye, wait about 5 minutes before putting in the next drop.</p>
