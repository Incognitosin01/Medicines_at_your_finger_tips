(Theragnostics) is coordinating with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to increase the availability of the drug. Theragnostics has initiated temporary importation of DMSA Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc99m Succimer Injection into the U.S. market. This product is marketed in Germany and is manufactured in Dresden, Germany by ROTOP Pharmaka GmbH for Theragnostics.</p><p>At this time, no other entity except ROTOP Pharmaka GmbH, Germany through its US Agent, Theragnostics, and Theragnostics' distributor, Medi-Physics Inc., dba GE Healthcare, is authorized by the FDA to import or distribute the DMSA Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc99m Succimer Injection in the U.S. FDA has not approved ROTOP Pharmaka GmbH's Kit for DMSA Preparation of Technetium Tc99m Succimer Injection product in the U.S.</p><p>Effective immediately, and during this temporary period, Theragnostics will offer the following presentation of ROTOP DMSA Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc99m Succimer Injection:</p><p>The vial and carton labels will display the text, translated to English, as approved via the Marketing Authorization of EEA in Germany. At the end of this letter you will find a product comparison table with the prescribing information in English, as well as images of the labels for your reference.</p><p><span class="Bold Underline">There are some differences in the labeling between the FDA-approved DMSA Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc99m Succimer Injection (GE Healthcare) product and ROTOP DMSA Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc99m Succimer Injection (Theragnostics) product (please see the product comparison tables below). These differences do not alter the favorable risk/benefit of the drug:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>In alignment with current practice, the ROTOP DMSA Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc99m Succimer label does not include a statement under the heading "Pediatric Use" that appears in the GE Healthcare label as follows: "Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."</li>
<li>Unlike the GE Healthcare label, the ROTOP DMSA Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc99m Succimer label contains pediatric dosing information under the heading "How to Use ROTOP DMSA". Pediatric doses can also be calculated online through the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging website's Pediatric Injected Activity Tool.</li>
<li>The ROTOP DMSA Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc99m Succimer label does not state the product is sterile; however, like the GE Healthcare product, ROTOP DMSA Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc99m Succimer is manufactured to be sterile.</li>
<li>Side effects encountered with use of the ROTOP DMSA Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc99m Succimer within the U.S. can be reported directly to Theragnostics, Inc., at 1-888-286-3848 rather than the foreign site referenced in the label for ROTOP DMSA Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc99m Succimer.</li>
