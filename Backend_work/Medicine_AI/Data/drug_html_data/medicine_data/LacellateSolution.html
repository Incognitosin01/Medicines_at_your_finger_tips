The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period, e.g., di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), up to 5 parts per million. However, the safety of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies.</p><h2>Lacellate Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP has value as a source of water and electrolytes. It is capable of inducing diuresis depending on the clinical condition of the patient.</p><p>Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP produces a metabolic alkalinizing effect. Lactate ions are metabolized ultimately to carbon dioxide and water, which requires the consumption of hydrogen cations.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Lacellate Solution</h2><p class="First">Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP is indicated as a source of water and electrolytes or as an alkalinizing agent.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">As for other calcium-containing infusion solutions, concomitant administration of ceftriaxone and Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP is contraindicated in newborns (≤ 28 days of age), even if separate infusion lines are used (risk of fatal ceftriaxone-calcium salt precipitation in the neonate’s bloodstream).</p><p>In patients older than 28 days (including adults), ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with intravenous calcium-containing solutions, including Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP, through the same infusion line (e.g., via Y-connector).<br/>
If the same infusion line is used for sequential administration, the line must be thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid.</p><p>Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to sodium lactate.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Although Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP has a potassium concentration similar to the concentration in plasma, it is insufficient to produce a useful effect in case of severe potassium deficiency; therefore, it should not be used for this purpose.</p><p>Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP is not for use for the treatment of lactic acidosis or severe metabolic acidosis.</p><p>Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP should not be administered simultaneously with citrate anticoagulated/preserved blood through the same administration set because of the likelihood of coagulation.</p><p>The infusion must be stopped immediately if any signs or symptoms of a suspected hypersensitivity reaction develop. Appropriate therapeutic countermeasures must be instituted as clinically indicated. Hypersensitivity reactions are reported more frequently during pregnancy.</p><p>Depending on the volume and the rate of infusion, the intravenous administration of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states, pulmonary edema or acid-base imbalance. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injections. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injections.</p><p>Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations may be necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient or the rate of administration warrants such evaluation.</p><p>Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP should be administered with particular caution, if at all, to patients with hyperkalemia or conditions predisposing to hyperkalemia (such as severe renal impairment or adrenocortical insufficiency, acute dehydration, or extensive tissue injury or burns) and in patients with cardiac disease.</p><p>Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP should be administered with particular caution, if at all, to patients with alkalosis or at risk for alkalosis. Because lactate is metabolized to bicarbonate, administration may result in, or worsen, metabolic alkalosis.</p><p>Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP should be administered with particular caution, if at all, to patients with severe renal impairment, hypervolemia, overhydration, or conditions that may cause sodium and/or potassium retention, fluid overload, or edema.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Do not connect flexible plastic containers in series in order to avoid air embolism due to possible residual air contained in the primary container.</p><p>Pressurizing intravenous solutions contained in flexible plastic containers to increase flow rates can result in air embolism if the residual air in the container is not fully evacuated prior to administration.</p><p>Use of a vented intravenous administration set with the vent in the open position could result in air embolism. Vented intravenous administration sets with the vent in the open position should not be used with flexible plastic containers.</p><p>Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP should be administered with particular caution, if at all, to patients with conditions associated with increased lactate levels or impaired lactate utilization, such as severe hepatic insufficiency.</p><p>Hyperlactatemia can develop in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, since lactate metabolism may be impaired. In addition Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP may not produce its alkalinizing action in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, since lactate metabolism may be impaired.</p><p>Solutions containing calcium salts should be used with caution in patients with hypercalcemia or conditions predisposing to hypercalemia, such as patients with severe renal impairment and granulomatous diseases associated with increased calcitriol synthesis such as sarcoidosis, calcium renal calculi or history of such calculi.</p><p>Lactate is a substrate for gluconeogenesis. This should be taken into account when Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP is used in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well controlled trials, however, the use of electrolyte solutions in the pediatric population is referenced in the medical literature. The warnings, precautions and adverse reactions identified in the label copy should be observed in the pediatric population.</p><p>Lactate-containing solutions should be administered with particular caution to neonates and infants less than 6 months of age.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Ceftriaxone – see CONTRAINDICATIONS</p><p>Caution is advised when administering Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP to patients treated with drugs that may increase the risk of sodium and fluid retention, such as corticosteroids.</p><p>Caution is advised when administering Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP to patients treated with drugs for which renal elimination is pH dependent. Due to the alkalinizing action of lactate (formation of bicarbonate), Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP may interfere with the elimination of such drugs.</p><p>Renal clearance of lithium may also be increased. Caution is advised when administering Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP to patients treated with lithium.</p><p>Because of its potassium content, Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP should be administered with caution in patients treated with agents or products that can cause hyperkalemia or increase risk of hyperkalemia, such as potassium sparing diuretics (amiloride, spironolactone, triamterene), with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, or the immunosuppressants tacrolimus and cyclosporine.</p><p>Caution is advised when administering Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP to patients treated with thiazide diuretics or vitamin D, as these can increase the risk of hypercalcemia.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP. It is also not known whether Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.
