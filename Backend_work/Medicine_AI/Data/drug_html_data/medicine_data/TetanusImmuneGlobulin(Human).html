Wound management includes proper use of tetanus toxoid and/or tetanus immune globulin (TIG), wound cleaning, and (if required) surgical debridement and the proper use of antibiotics. Patients with an uncertain or incomplete tetanus immunization status should have additional follow-up to ensure a series is completed. Patients with a history of Arthus reaction following a previous dose of a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine should not receive a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine until &gt;10 years after the most recent dose even if they have a wound that is neither clean nor minor (CDC/ACIP [Liang 2018]).

Administer in the anterolateral aspects of the upper thigh or the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Avoid gluteal region due to risk of injury to sciatic nerve; if gluteal region is used, administer only in the upper outer quadrant. If tetanus vaccine and tetanus immune globulin are administered simultaneously, separate syringes at different anatomical sites should be used for each injection. When used for the treatment of tetanus, infiltration of part of the dose around the wound is recommended (CDC 2015a).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 2°C to 8°C (26°F to 46°F). Do not use if frozen.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Vaccines (Live): Immune Globulins may diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Live).  Management: Consult full interaction monograph for dose interval recommendations.  This interaction does not apply to oral Ty21a typhoid vaccine or others listed as exceptions.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Frequency not defined.</p><p>Central nervous system: Increased body temperature</p><p>Local: Local soreness/soreness at injection site, pain at injection site, tenderness at injection site</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Anaphylactic shock, angioedema, nephrotic syndrome</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions can occur; immediate treatment (including epinephrine 1 mg/mL) should be available. Use with caution in patients with isolated immunoglobulin A deficiency or a history of systemic hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulins.  </p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorders; IM injections may be contraindicated.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Human plasma: Product of human plasma; may potentially contain infectious agents which could transmit disease. Screening of donors, as well as testing and/or inactivation or removal of certain viruses, reduces the risk. Infections thought to be transmitted by this product should be reported to the manufacturer.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Administration: Not for intravenous administration.</p><p>• Appropriate use: When used for the treatment of tetanus infection, TIG removes circulating toxin, but does not remove toxin bound to nerve endings (CDC 2012). Larger doses of TIG are needed for treatment than prophylaxis (see Dosage) (MMWR 2015).</p><p>• Skin testing: Skin testing should not be performed as local irritation can occur and be misinterpreted as a positive allergic reaction.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted. Tetanus immune globulin and a tetanus toxoid containing vaccine are recommended by the ACIP as part of the standard wound management to prevent tetanus in pregnant women (CDC 57[RR6], 2008; CDC 62[7], 2013).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat or prevent tetanus.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
