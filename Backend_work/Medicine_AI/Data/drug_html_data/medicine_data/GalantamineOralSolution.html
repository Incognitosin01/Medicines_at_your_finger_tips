</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Galantamine Oral Solution</h2><p class="First">Galantamine is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.</p><h2>Galantamine Oral Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Galantamine Oral Solution</h3><p class="First">The dosage of galantamine tablets shown to be effective in controlled clinical trials is 16 mg to 32 mg/day given as twice daily dosing. As the dosage of 32 mg/day is less well tolerated than lower dosages and does not provide increased effectiveness, the recommended dosage range is 16 mg to 24 mg/day given twice daily. The dosage of 24 mg/day did not provide a statistically significant greater clinical benefit than 16 mg/day. It is possible, however, that a daily dosage of 24 mg of galantamine might provide additional benefit for some patients.</p><p>The recommended starting dosage of Galantamine Oral Solution is 4 mg twice a day (8 mg/day). The dosage should be increased to the initial maintenance dosage of 8 mg twice a day (16 mg/day) after a minimum of 4 weeks. A further increase to 12 mg twice a day (24 mg/day) should be attempted after a minimum of 4 weeks at 8 mg twice a day (16 mg/day).</p><p>Dosage increases should be based upon assessment of clinical benefit and tolerability of the previous dose.</p><p>Galantamine Oral Solution should be administered twice a day, preferably with morning and evening meals.</p><p>Patients and caregivers should be advised to ensure adequate fluid intake during treatment. If therapy has been interrupted for more than three days, the patient should be restarted at the lowest dosage and the dosage escalated to the current dose.</p><p>The abrupt withdrawal of galantamine in those patients who had been receiving dosages in the effective range was not associated with an increased frequency of adverse events in comparison with those continuing to receive the same dosages of that drug. The beneficial effects of galantamine are lost, however, when the drug is discontinued.</p><h3>Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 7 to 9), the dosage should generally not exceed 16 mg/day. The use of galantamine in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 10 to 15) is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with creatinine clearance of 9 mL to 59 mL/min, the dosage should generally not exceed 16 mg/day. In patients with creatinine clearance less than 9 mL/min, the use of galantamine is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Galantamine Oral Solution USP, 4 mg/mL is a clear, colorless to pale yellow solution supplied in 100 mL bottles with a calibrated (in milligrams and milliliters) syringe. The minimum calibrated volume is 0.5 mL, while the maximum calibrated volume is 4 mL.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Galantamine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to galantamine hydrobromide or to any excipients used in the formulation.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis) have been reported in patients receiving galantamine. Inform patients and caregivers that the use of galantamine should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a serious skin reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.</p><h3>Anesthesia</h3><p class="First">Galantamine, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate the neuromuscular blocking effects of succinylcholine-type and similar neuromuscular blocking agents during anesthesia.</p><h3>Cardiovascular Conditions</h3><p class="First">Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, leading to bradycardia and AV block. Bradycardia and all types of heart block have been reported in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions(6.1, 6.2)]</span>. Therefore, all patients should be considered at risk for adverse effects on cardiac conduction.</p><p>Patients treated with galantamine up to 24 mg/day using the recommended dosing schedule showed a dose-related increase in risk of syncope (placebo 0.7% [2/286]; 4 mg twice daily 0.4% [3/692]; 8 mg twice daily 1.3% [7/552]; 12 mg twice daily 2.2% [6/273]).</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First">Through their primary action, cholinomimetics may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those with an increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or patients using concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of galantamine have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.</p><p>Galantamine, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss. During therapy, the patient’s weight should be monitored.</p><h3>Genitourinary Conditions</h3><p class="First">Although this was not observed in clinical trials with galantamine, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction.</p><h3>Neurological Conditions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Seizures:</span></p><p>Cholinesterase inhibitors are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. Seizure activity may also be a manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease. Patients with Alzheimer’s disease should be monitored closely for seizures while taking galantamine.</p><h3>Pulmonary Conditions</h3><p class="First">Because of its cholinomimetic action, galantamine should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of severe asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease. Respiratory function should be monitored closely for the occurrence of respiratory adverse effects.</p><h3>Deaths in Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)</h3><p class="First">In two randomized placebo controlled trials of 2 years duration in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a total of 13 patients on galantamine (n=1026) and 1 patient on placebo (n=1022) died. The deaths were due to various causes which could be expected in an elderly population; about half of the galantamine deaths appeared to result from various vascular causes (myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden death).</p><p>Although the difference in mortality between galantamine- and placebo-treated groups in these two studies was significant, the results are highly discrepant with other studies of galantamine. Specifically, in these two MCI studies, the mortality rate in the placebo-treated patients was markedly lower than the rate in placebo-treated patients in trials of galantamine in Alzheimer’s disease or other dementias (0.7 per 1000 person years compared to 22 to 61 per 1000 person years, respectively). Although the mortality rate in the galantamine-treated MCI patients was also lower than that observed in galantamine-treated patients in Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia trials (10.2 per 1000 person years compared to 23 to 31 per 1000 person years, respectively), the relative difference was much less. When the Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia studies were pooled (n=6000), the mortality rate in the placebo group numerically exceeded that in the galantamine group. Furthermore, in the MCI studies, no patients in the placebo group died after 6 months, a highly unexpected finding in this population.</p><p>Individuals with mild cognitive impairment demonstrate isolated memory impairment greater than expected for their age and education, but do not meet current diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer’s disease.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in the following sections of the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions in galantamine-treated patients from double-blind clinical trials (≥5%) were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, and decreased appetite.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions associated with discontinuation (≥1%) in galantamine-treated patients from double-blind clinical trials were nausea (6.2%), vomiting (3.3%), decreased appetite (1.5%), and dizziness (1.3%).</p><p>The safety of the extended-release capsule and immediate-release tablet formulations of galantamine was evaluated in 3956 galantamine-treated patients who participated in 8 placebo-controlled clinical studies and 1454 subjects in 5 open-label clinical studies with mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer’s type. In clinical studies, the safety profile of once-daily treatment with extended-release galantamine was similar in frequency and nature to that seen with tablets. The information presented in this section was derived from pooled double-blind studies and from pooled open-label data.</p><p><span class="Italics">Commonly-Observed Adverse Reactions in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials:</span></p><p>Table 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in ≥1% of galantamine-treated patients in 8 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1.

In studies conducted in animals, administration of galantamine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (increased incidence of morphological abnormalities and decreased growth in offspring) at doses similar to or greater than those used clinically. Galantamineshould be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>In rats, administration of galantamine (oral doses of 2 mg, 8 mg, or 16 mg/kg/day), from day 14 (females) or day 60 (males) prior to mating and continuing in females through the period of organogenesis, resulted in an increased incidence of fetal skeletal variations at the two highest doses. The no-effect dose for embryo-fetal developmental toxicity in rats (2 mg/kg/day) is approximately equal to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD of 24 mg/day) on a body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) basis. When galantamine (oral doses of 4 mg, 12 mg, 28 mg, or 48 mg/kg/day) was administered to pregnant rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis, small increases in fetal visceral malformations and skeletal variations were observed at the highest dose. The no-effect dose for embryo-fetal developmental toxicity in rabbits (28 mg/kg/day) is approximately 20 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In a study in which pregnant rats were orally dosed with galantamine (2 mg, 8 mg, or 16 mg/kg/day) from the beginning of organogenesis through day 21 post-partum, pup weights were decreased at birth and during the lactation period at the two highest doses. The no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity in rats (2 mg/kg/day) is approximately equal to the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when galantamineis administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Eight double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials and 5 open-label trials in a total of 6519 patients have investigated galantaminein the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer’s type <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>and<span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14)].</span> The mean age of patients enrolled in these clinical studies was 75 years; 78% of these patients were between 65 and 84 years of age, and 10% of patients were 85 years of age or older.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, a dosage adjustment is recommended. The use of galantaminein patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span>and<span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with a creatinine clearance of 9 mL to 59 mL/min, a dosage adjustment is recommended. The use of galantamine in patients with creatinine clearance less than 9 mL/min is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span>and<span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving, it is advisable to contact a poison control center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an overdose of any drug.</p><p>As in any case of overdose, general supportive measures should be utilized. Signs and symptoms of significant overdosing of galantamine are predicted to be similar to those of overdosing of other cholinomimetics. These effects generally involve the central nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system, and the neuromuscular junction. In addition to muscle weakness or fasciculations, some or all of the following signs of cholinergic crisis may develop: severe nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal cramping, salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression, collapse and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.</p><p>Tertiary anticholinergics such as atropine may be used as an antidote for galantamineoverdosage. Intravenous atropine sulfate titrated to effect is recommended at an initial dose of 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg i.v. with subsequent doses based upon clinical response. Atypical responses in blood pressure and heart rate have been reported with other cholinomimetics when co-administered with quaternary anticholinergics. It is not known whether galantamine and/or its metabolites can be removed by dialysis (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or hemofiltration). Dose-related signs of toxicity in animals included hypoactivity, tremors, clonic convulsions, salivation, lacrimation, chromodacryorrhea, mucoid feces, and dyspnea.</p><p>In one postmarketing report, one patient who had been taking 4 mg of galantamine daily for a week inadvertently ingested eight 4 mg tablets (32 mg total) on a single day. Subsequently, she developed bradycardia, QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes accompanied by a brief loss of consciousness for which she required hospital treatment. Two additional cases of accidental ingestion of 32 mg (nausea, vomiting, and dry mouth; nausea, vomiting, and substernal chest pain) and one of 40 mg (vomiting), resulted in brief hospitalizations for observation with full recovery. One patient, who was prescribed 24 mg/day and had a history of hallucinations over the previous two years, mistakenly received 24 mg twice daily for 34 days and developed hallucinations requiring hospitalization. Another patient, who was prescribed 16 mg/day of oral solution, inadvertently ingested 160 mg (40 mL) and experienced sweating, vomiting, bradycardia, and near-syncope one hour later, which necessitated hospital treatment. His symptoms resolved within 24 hours.</p><h2>Galantamine Oral Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Galantamine Oral Solution, USP contain galantamine hydrobromide, USP, a reversible, competitive acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, as the hydrobromide salt. Galantamine hydrobromide is known chemically as (4a<span class="Italics">S</span>,6<span class="Italics">R</span>,8a<span class="Italics">S</span>)-4a,5,9,10,11,12-hexahydro-3-methoxy-11-methyl-6<span class="Italics">H</span>-benzofuro[3a,3,2-<span class="Italics">ef</span>][2]benzazepin-6-ol hydrobromide. It has an empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span> •HBr and a molecular weight of 368.27. Galantamine hydrobromide, USP is a white to off-white powder and is sparingly soluble in water. The structural formula is:</p><p>Galantamine Oral Solution, USP contains 4 mg (as 5.13 mg galantamine hydrobromide, USP) per mL. The inactive ingredients are methylparaben, propylparaben, purified water and saccharin sodium. Galantamine may contain hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide to adjust pH.</p><h2>Galantamine Oral Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Although the etiology of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is not fully understood, it has been reported that acetylcholine-producing neurons degenerate in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The degree of this cholinergic loss has been correlated with degree of cognitive impairment and density of amyloid plaques (a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease).</p><p>Galantamine, a tertiary alkaloid, is a competitive and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. While the precise mechanism of galantamine’s action is unknown, it is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. If this mechanism is correct, galantamine’s effect may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact. There is no evidence that galantamine alters the course of the underlying dementing process.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of galantamine are linear over a dose range of 8 mg to 32 mg/day.</p><p><span class="Italics">Absorption and Distribution</span></p><p>Galantamine is absorbed with time to peak concentration of about 1 hour. The absolute bioavailability of galantamine is about 90%. The bioavailability of the tablet formulation was the same as the bioavailability of the oral solution formulation. Food did not affect the AUC of galantamine, but C<span class="Sub">max</span> was decreased by 25% and T<span class="Sub">max</span> was delayed by 1.5 hours, when galantamine was administered with food. The mean volume of distribution of galantamine is 175 L.</p><p>The plasma protein binding of galantamine is 18% at therapeutically relevant concentrations. In whole blood, galantamine is mainly distributed to blood cells (52.7%). The blood to plasma concentration ratio of galantamine is 1.2.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Elimination</span></p><p>Galantamine is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, glucuronidated, and excreted unchanged in the urine. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicate that cytochrome CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 were the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of galantamine, and inhibitors of both pathways increase oral bioavailability of galantamine modestly. O-demethylation, mediated by CYP2D6 was greater in extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 than in poor metabolizers. In plasma from both poor and extensive metabolizers, however, unchanged galantamine and its glucuronide accounted for most of the sample radioactivity.</p><p>In studies of oral <span class="Sup">3</span>H-galantamine, unchanged galantamine and its glucuronide, accounted for most plasma radioactivity in poor and extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers. Up to 8 hours post-dose, unchanged galantamine accounted for 39% to 77% of the total radioactivity in the plasma, and galantamine glucuronide for 14% to 24%. By 7 days, 93% to 99% of the radioactivity had been recovered, with about 95% in urine and about 5% in the feces. Total urinary recovery of unchanged galantamine accounted for, on average, 32% of the dose and that of galantamine glucuronide for another 12% on average.</p><p>After i.v. or oral administration, about 20% of the dose was excreted as unchanged galantamine in the urine in 24 hours, representing a renal clearance of about 65 mL/min, about 20% to 25% of the total plasma clearance of about 300 mL/min.

In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (n=8; Child Pugh score of 7 to 9), galantamine clearance was decreased by about 25% compared to galantamine clearance in normal volunteers.

Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that there was a 25% decrease in median clearance in poor metabolizers compared to extensive metabolizers.

Doses studied with the tablet formulation were 8 mg to 32 mg/day given as twice daily doses. In 3 of the 4 studies with the tablet, patients were started on a low dose of 8 mg, then titrated weekly by 8 mg/day to 24 mg or 32 mg as assigned. In the fourth study (USA 4-week Dose Escalation Fixed-Dose Study) dose escalation of 8 mg/day occurred over 4-week intervals. The mean age of patients participating in these 4 galantamine trials was 75 years with a range of 41 to 100. Approximately 62% of patients were women and 38% were men. The racial distribution was White 94%, Black 3% and other races 3%. Two other studies examined a three times daily dosing regimen; these also showed or suggested benefit but did not suggest an advantage over twice daily dosing.</p><h3>Study Outcome Measures</h3><p class="First">In each study, the primary effectiveness of galantamine was evaluated using a dual outcome assessment strategy as measured by the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) and the Clinician’s Interview Based Impression of Change that required the use of caregiver information (CIBIC-plus).</p><p>The ability of galantamine to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive sub-scale of the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), a multi-item instrument that has been extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer’s disease patients. The ADAS-cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance including elements of memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language and praxis. The ADAS-cog scoring range is from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Elderly normal adults may score as low as 0 or 1, but it is not unusual for non-demented adults to score slightly higher.</p><p>The patients recruited as participants in each study using the tablet formulation had mean scores on ADAS-cog of approximately 27 units, with a range from 5 to 69. Experience gained in longitudinal studies of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease suggests that they gain 6 to 12 units a year on the ADAS-cog. Lesser degrees of change, however, are seen in patients with very mild or very advanced disease because the ADAS-cog is not uniformly sensitive to change over the course of the disease. The annualized rate of decline in the placebo patients participating in galantamine trials was approximately 4.5 units per year.</p><p>The ability of galantamine to produce an overall clinical effect was assessed using a Clinician’s Interview Based Impression of Change that required the use of caregiver information, the CIBIC-plus. The CIBIC-plus is not a single instrument and is not a standardized instrument like the ADAS-cog. Clinical trials for investigational drugs have used a variety of CIBIC formats, each different in terms of depth and structure. As such, results from a CIBIC-plus reflect clinical experience from the trial or trials in which it was used and cannot be compared directly with the results of CIBIC-plus evaluations from other clinical trials. The CIBIC-plus used in the trials was a semi-structured instrument based on a comprehensive evaluation at baseline and subsequent time-points of 4 major areas of patient function: general, cognitive, behavioral and activities of daily living. It represents the assessment of a skilled clinician based on his/her observation at an interview with the patient, in combination with information supplied by a caregiver familiar with the behavior of the patient over the interval rated. The CIBIC-plus is scored as a seven point categorical rating, ranging from a score of 1, indicating “markedly improved,” to a score of 4, indicating “no change” to a score of 7, indicating “marked worsening.” The CIBIC-plus has not been systematically compared directly to assessments not using information from caregivers (CIBIC) or other global methods.</p><h3>Immediate-Release Tablets</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">U.S. Twenty-One Week Fixed-Dose Study</span></p><p>In a study of 21 weeks duration, 978 patients were randomized to doses of 8 mg, 16 mg, or 24 mg of galantamine per day, or to placebo, each given in 2 divided doses. Treatment was initiated at 8 mg/day for all patients randomized to galantamine, and increased by 8 mg/day every 4 weeks. Therefore, the maximum titration phase was 8 weeks and the minimum maintenance phase was 13 weeks (in patients randomized to 24 mg/day of galantamine).</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the ADAS-cog:</span> Figure 1 illustrates the time course for the change from baseline in ADAS-cog scores for all four dose groups over the 21 weeks of the study.
