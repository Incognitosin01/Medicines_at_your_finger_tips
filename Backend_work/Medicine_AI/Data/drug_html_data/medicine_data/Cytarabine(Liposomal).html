Cytarabine is converted intracellularly to its active metabolite cytarabine-5’-triphosphate (ara-CTP). Ara-CTP also appears to be incorporated into DNA and RNA; however, the primary action is inhibition of DNA polymerase, resulting in decreased DNA synthesis and repair. The liposomal formulation allows for gradual release, resulting in prolonged exposure. </p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Systemic exposure following intrathecal administration is negligible since transfer rate from CSF to plasma is slow</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Cerebrospinal fluid: Intrathecal: Within 1 hour.</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Cerebrospinal fluid: ~6 to 82 hours.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Lymphomatous meningitis:</b> Intrathecal treatment of lymphomatous meningitis</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to cytarabine or any component of the formulation; active meningeal infection</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note:</b> DepoCyt is no longer available in the US.</p><p><b>Note: Initiate dexamethasone 4 mg twice daily (oral or IV) for 5 days, beginning on the day of cytarabine liposomal administration.</b></p><p><b>Lymphomatous meningitis:</b> Intrathecal:</p><p><i>Induction:</i> 50 mg every 14 days for a total of 2 doses (weeks 1 and 3)</p><p><i>Consolidation:</i> 50 mg every 14 days for 3 doses (weeks 5, 7, and 9), followed by an additional dose at week 13</p><p><i>Maintenance:</i> 50 mg every 28 days for 4 doses (weeks 17, 21, 25, and 29)</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Dosing: Adjustment for Toxicity</h2><p>Neurotoxicity: If drug-related neurotoxicity develops, reduce dose to 25 mg. If toxicity persists, discontinue treatment.</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Allow vial to warm to room temperature. Particles may settle in diluent over time, and may be resuspended with gentle agitation or inversion immediately prior to withdrawing from the vial. Do not agitate aggressively. Withdraw from the vial immediately prior to administration. No further reconstitution or dilution is required. Do not mix with any other medications. Intrathecal medications should not be prepared during the preparation of any other agents (Jacobson 2009).</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Intrathecal: For intrathecal use (intraventricular or lumbar puncture) only. Dose should be removed from vial immediately before administration (must be administered within 4 hours of removal from the vial). An in-line filter should <b>NOT</b> be used. Administer directly into the cerebrospinal fluid via an intraventricular reservoir or by direct injection into the lumbar sac. Injection should be made slowly (over 1 to 5 minutes). Patients should lie flat for 1 hour after lumbar puncture. After administration, observe for immediate toxic reactions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store intact vial at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F); protect from freezing. Avoid aggressive agitation. Withdraw from the vial immediately prior to administration; solutions should be used within 4 hours of withdrawal from the vial.</p><p>After preparation, store intrathecal medications in an isolated location or container clearly marked with a label identifying as "intrathecal" use only (Jacobson 2009).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Cedazuridine: May increase the serum concentration of Cytidine Deaminase Substrates.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Cladribine: Agents that Undergo Intracellular Phosphorylation may diminish the therapeutic effect of Cladribine. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Solriamfetol: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Hypertension-Associated Agents.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>&gt;10%:</p><p>Cardiovascular: Peripheral edema (11%)</p><p>Central nervous system: Chemical arachnoiditis (without dexamethasone premedication: 100%; with dexamethasone premedication: 33% to 42%; grade 4: 19% to 30%; onset: ≤5 days), headache (56%), confusion (33%), fatigue (25%), abnormal gait (23%), seizure (20% to 22%), dizziness (18%), lethargy (16%), insomnia (14%), memory impairment (14%), pain (14%)</p><p>Endocrine &amp; metabolic: Dehydration (13%)</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Nausea (46%), vomiting (44%), constipation (25%), diarrhea (12%), decreased appetite (11%)</p><p>Genitourinary: Urinary tract infection (14%)</p><p>Hematologic &amp; oncologic: Anemia (12%), thrombocytopenia (3% to 11%)</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Weakness (40%), back pain (24%), limb pain (15%), neck pain (14%), arthralgia (11%), neck stiffness (11%)</p><p>Ophthalmic: Blurred vision (11%)</p><p>Miscellaneous: Fever (32%)</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Cardiovascular: Tachycardia (9%), hypotension (8%), hypertension (6%), syncope (3%), edema (2%)</p><p>Central nervous system: Agitation (10%), hypoesthesia (10%), myasthenia (10%), depression (8%), anxiety (7%), peripheral neuropathy (3% to 4%), abnormal reflexes (3%), sensorimotor neuropathy (3%)</p><p>Dermatologic: Diaphoresis (2%), pruritus (2%)</p><p>Endocrine &amp; metabolic: Hypokalemia (7%), hyponatremia (7%), hyperglycemia (6%)</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain (9%), dysphagia (8%), anorexia (5%), hemorrhoids (3%), mucosal inflammation (3%)</p><p>Genitourinary: Urinary incontinence (7%), urinary retention (5%)</p><p>Hematologic &amp; oncologic: Neutropenia (10%), bruise (2%)</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Tremor (9%)</p><p>Otic: Hypoacusis (6%)</p><p>Respiratory: Dyspnea (10%), cough (7%), pneumonia (6%)</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Anaphylaxis, bladder disease (bladder control impaired), blindness, brain disease, cauda equina syndrome, cranial nerve palsy, deafness, drowsiness, fecal incontinence, hemiplegia, hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, leukocytosis (in CSF), meningitis (infectious), myelopathy, nervous system disease (neurologic deficit), numbness, papilledema, visual disturbance</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">ALERT: U.S. Boxed Warning</h2><p>Chemical arachnoiditis, a syndrome manifested primarily by nausea, vomiting, headache, and fever, was a common adverse event in all clinical studies. If left untreated, chemical arachnoiditis may be fatal. Patients receiving intrathecal cytarabine liposomal should be treated concurrently with dexamethasone to mitigate the symptoms of chemical arachnoiditis.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Chemical arachnoiditis: <b> [US Boxed Warning]: Chemical arachnoiditis (nausea, vomiting, headache, fever) occurs commonly; may be fatal if untreated. Dexamethasone should be administered concomitantly with cytarabine (liposomal) to diminish chemical arachnoid symptoms;</b> the incidence and severity of chemical arachnoiditis is reduced with dexamethasone. If chemical arachnoiditis is suspected, exclude other possible inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic conditions. Toxic effects may be related to a single dose or to cumulative administration and usually occur within 5 days, although may occur at any time during treatment. Monitor continuously for development of neurotoxicity; dose reduction or discontinuation may be necessary. Hydrocephalus has been reported and may be precipitated by chemical arachnoiditis.</p><p>• CSF component elevations: Transient elevations in CSF protein and CSF white blood cell counts have been observed following administration.</p><p>• Neurotoxicity: May cause neurotoxicity (including myelopathy), which may lead to permanent neurologic deficit (rare). The risk for neurotoxicity is increased when administered with other antineoplastic agents or with cranial/spinal irradiation. CSF flow blockage may lead to increased free cytarabine concentrations in the CSF and increases the risk for neurotoxicity; consider assessing CSF flow prior to administration. Persistent (extreme) somnolence, hemiplegia, visual disturbances (including blindness; may be total and permanent), deafness, cranial nerve palsies have been reported. Signs/symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (eg, pain, numbness, paresthesia, weakness, impaired bowel/bladder control) have also been reported. Combined neurologic features (cauda equina syndrome) have been reported in some cases. If neurotoxicity develops, reduce subsequent doses or discontinue treatment. Headache, nausea, and fever are early signs of neurotoxicity.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Intrathecal safety: Intrathecal medications should not be prepared during the preparation of any other agents. After preparation, store intrathecal medications in an isolated location or container clearly marked with a label identifying as "intrathecal" use only. Delivery of intrathecal medications to the patient should only be with other medications also intended for administration into the central nervous system (Jacobson 2009).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor closely for signs/symptoms of an immediate reaction,chemical arachnoiditis, or neurotoxicity</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Systemic exposure following intrathecal administration of cytarabine liposomal is negligible; however, women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Adverse effects were observed in animal reproductive studies with conventional cytarabine. Conventional cytarabine has been associated with fetal malformations when given as a component of systemic combination chemotherapy during the first trimester. Systemic exposure following intrathecal administration of cytarabine liposomal is negligible.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat a type of cancer in the brain fluid.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
