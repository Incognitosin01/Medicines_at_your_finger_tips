</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 100 units per mL (U-100) is 75% insulin lispro protamine and 25% insulin lispro, a white and cloudy suspension available as:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>3 mL single-patient-use KwikPen (prefilled)</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 is contraindicated:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>during episodes of hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
<li>in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 or to any of its excipients. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Never Share an Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 KwikPen Between Patients</h3><p class="First">Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 KwikPens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.</p><h3>5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen</h3><p class="First">Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span> or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to an unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</p><p>Make any changes to a patient's insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed.</p><h3>Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with all insulin therapies, including Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life-threatening, or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery).</p><p>Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>, or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia</span></p><p>The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia</span></p><p>Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.</p><h3>Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">Accidental mix-ups between Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 and other insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve. Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 or any of its excipients <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypokalemia</h3><p class="First">All insulin products, including Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations).</p><h3>Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists</h3><p class="First">Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

Published studies with insulin lispro used during pregnancy have not reported an association between insulin lispro and the induction of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span> There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations).</span></p><p>Pregnant rats and rabbits were exposed to insulin lispro in animal reproduction studies during organogenesis. No adverse effects on embryo/fetal viability or morphology were observed in offspring of rats exposed to insulin lispro at a dose approximately 3 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit insulin lispro/kg/day. No adverse effects on embryo/fetal development were observed in offspring of rabbits exposed to insulin lispro at doses up to approximately 0.2 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a HbA1c &gt;7 and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a HbA1c &gt;10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk</span></p><p>Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Published data from retrospective studies and meta-analyses do not report an association with insulin lispro and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when insulin lispro is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish or exclude the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations including small sample size, selection bias, confounding by unmeasured factors, and some lacking comparator groups.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been performed with Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25. However, subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been conducted with insulin lispro (a component of Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25). In a combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study, female rats were given subcutaneous insulin lispro injections of 1, 5, and 20 units/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, and 3 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit insulin lispro/kg/day, based on units/body surface area, respectively) from 2 weeks prior to cohabitation through Gestation Day 19. There were no adverse effects on female fertility, implantation, or fetal viability and morphology. However, fetal growth retardation was produced at the 20 units/kg/day-dose as indicated by decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of fetal runts/litter.</p><p>In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits, insulin lispro doses of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.75 unit/kg/day (0.03, 0.08, and 0.2 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit insulin lispro/kg/day, based on units/body surface area, respectively) were injected subcutaneously on Gestation days 7 through 19. There were no adverse effects on fetal viability, weight, and morphology at any dose.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. One small published study reported that exogenous insulin was present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for insulin, any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 in patients less than 18 years of age has not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. In elderly patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dose increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 has not been studied. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 dose adjustment and more frequent glucose monitoring <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 has not been studied. Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 dose adjustment and more frequent glucose monitoring <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Excess insulin administration may cause hypoglycemia and hypokalemia. Mild episodes of hypoglycemia usually can be treated with oral glucose. Adjustments in drug dosage, meal patterns, or exercise may be needed. More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular or subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.6)].</span></p><h2>Insulin Lispro Mix 75/25 Kwikpen Description</h2><p class="First">Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 is a mixture of 75% insulin lispro protamine, an intermediate-acting human insulin analog, and 25% insulin lispro, a rapid-acting human insulin analog. Insulin lispro is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>. Insulin lispro differs from human insulin in that the amino acid proline at position B28 is replaced by lysine and the lysine in position B29 is replaced by proline. Chemically, it is Lys(B28), Pro(B29) human insulin analog and has the empirical formula C<span class="Sub">257</span>H<span class="Sub">383</span>N<span class="Sub">65</span>O<span class="Sub">77</span>S<span class="Sub">6</span> and a molecular weight of 5808, both identical to that of human insulin. Insulin lispro protamine suspension is a suspension of crystals produced from combining insulin lispro and protamine sulfate under appropriate conditions for crystal formation.</p><p>Insulin lispro has the following primary structure:</p><p>Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 KwikPens contain a white and cloudy, sterile suspension of insulin lispro protamine suspension mixed with soluble insulin lispro for use as an injection.</p><p>Each milliliter of Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 injection contains insulin lispro 100 units, 0.28 mg protamine sulfate, 16 mg glycerin, 3.78 mg dibasic sodium phosphate, 1.76 mg Metacresol, zinc oxide content adjusted to provide 0.025 mg zinc ion, 0.715 mg phenol, and Water for Injection. The pH is 7.0 to 7.8. Sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid may be added during manufacture to adjust the pH.</p><h2>Insulin Lispro Mix 75/25 Kwikpen - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The primary activity of insulin, including Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25, is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhance protein synthesis.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In a glucose clamp study performed in 30 healthy subjects, the onset of action and glucose-lowering activity of HUMALOG, HUMALOG<span class="Sup">®</span> Mix50/50™, Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25, and insulin lispro protamine suspension (ILPS) were compared (<span class="Italics">see</span> Figure 1). Graphs of mean glucose infusion rate versus time showed a distinct insulin activity profile for each formulation. The rapid onset of glucose-lowering activity characteristic of HUMALOG was maintained in Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25. The median maximum pharmacologic effect of Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 after administration of a 0.3 unit/kg dose to healthy subjects occurred at approximately 2 hours (range: 1-6 hours); glucose lowering activity was detectable for a median of 22 hours (range: 13 to 22 hours), which was the end of the clamp.</p><p>In separate glucose clamp studies performed in healthy subjects, pharmacodynamics of Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 and HUMULIN<span class="Sup">®</span> 70/30 were assessed and are presented in Figure 2. Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25 has a duration of activity similar to that of HUMULIN 70/30.</p><p>Figures 1 and 2 should be considered only as representative examples since the time course of action of insulin and insulin analogs, may vary in different individuals or within the same individual.<br/>

Identical results were found in patients with type 1 diabetes. The rapid absorption characteristics of HUMALOG are maintained with Insulin Lispro Protamine and Insulin Lispro Injectable Suspension Mix75/25.
