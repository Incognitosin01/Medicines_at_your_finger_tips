An image of the gland on film or on a computer screen can be provided to help with the diagnosis.</p><p>Iobenguane I 123 is also used during a test for patients with congestive heart failure. This may help the doctor see certain heart problems.</p><p>Iobenguane i 123 is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor with specialized training in nuclear medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using iobenguane i 123</h2><p>In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do.

Safety and efficacy have not been established in these populations.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of iobenguane I 123 in the elderly.
