<html><head></head><body><h1>Streptomycin (Intramuscular)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> streptomycin (strep-toe-MYE-sin)</p><p>The risk of severe neurotoxic reactions is sharply increased in patients with impaired renal function or prerenal azotemia. These include disturbances of vestibular and cochlear function, optic nerve dysfunction, peripheral neuritis, arachnoiditis, and encephalopathy may also occur. The incidence of clinically detectable, irreversible vestibular damage is particularly high in patients treated with streptomycin.Renal function should be monitored carefully; patients with renal impairment and/or nitrogen retention should receive reduced doses. The peak serum concentration in individuals with kidney damage should not exceed 20 to 25 mcg/mL.The concurrent or sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs with streptomycin sulfate, including neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, cephaloridine, paromomycin, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, tobramycin and cyclosporine should be avoided.The neurotoxicity of streptomycin can result in respiratory paralysis from neuromuscular blockage, especially when the drug is given soon after the use of anesthesia or muscle relaxants.The administration of streptomycin in parenteral form should be reserved for patients where adequate laboratory and audiometric testing facilities are available during therapy .</p><p>Available Dosage Forms:</p><ul>

It works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. However, streptomycin will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.</p><p>Streptomycin injection is usually used for serious bacterial infections for which other medicines may not work. However, it may also cause some serious side effects, including damage to your hearing and sense of balance. These side effects may be more likely to occur in elderly patients and newborn infants. <i>You and your doctor should talk about the benefits of streptomycin as well as the risks</i>.</p><p>Streptomycin is to be administered only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using streptomycin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For streptomycin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to streptomycin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of streptomycin injection in children. However, streptomycin should be used with caution in young infants.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of streptomycin injection in geriatric patients. However, elderly patients are more likely to have kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving streptomycin injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving streptomycin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using streptomycin with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of streptomycin</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you streptomycin. Streptomycin is given as a shot into one of your muscles (usually in the buttocks, middle thighs, or upper arms).</p><p>To help clear up your infection completely, <i>keep using streptomycin for the full time of treatment</i>, even if you begin to feel better after a few days. Also, streptomycin works best when there is a constant amount in the blood. To help keep the amount constant, you must receive streptomycin on a regular schedule.</p><p>To keep your kidneys working well and help prevent kidney problems, drink extra fluids so you will pass more urine while you are receiving streptomycin.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using streptomycin</h2><p><i>Your doctor will check your progress closely while you or your child are receiving streptomycin</i>. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you or your child should continue to receive it. Blood, urine, nerve, and hearing tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>You will need to see your doctor after finishing streptomycin to make sure your infection is gone. You may also need to see your doctor again in four months to have a repeat blood test done for other infections such as syphilis.</p><p>If your or your child's symptoms do not improve within a few days, or if they become worse, check with your doctor.</p><p>Using streptomycin while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Streptomycin may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you or your child have itching; hives; hoarseness; shortness of breath; trouble breathing; trouble swallowing; or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after you receive streptomycin.</p><p>High doses of streptomycin injection may cause serious reactions (e.g., syndrome of CNS depression) for a young infant. Infants should not receive a dose of streptomycin that is higher than the recommended dose.</p><p><i>Stop using streptomycin and check with your doctor right away if you or your child have sudden decrease in hearing or loss of hearing, which may be accompanied by dizziness and ringing in the ears</i>. Tell your doctor if you or your child have dizziness or lightheadedness; feeling of constant movement of self or surroundings; or sensation of spinning. These may be symptoms of damage to your hearing or sense of balance.</p><p>Make sure your doctor knows that you or your child are using streptomycin before having a surgery or other procedures that require you to receive a numbing medicine (e.g., anesthetics, neuromuscular blocking agents). Using streptomycin injection together with numbing medicines may increase your risk of having difficulty in breathing, drowsiness, inability to breath without assistance, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Streptomycin side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
