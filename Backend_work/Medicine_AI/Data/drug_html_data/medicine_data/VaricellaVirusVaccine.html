Gently agitate to mix thoroughly. Do not use if the lyophilized vaccine does not dissolve, if particulates are present, or liquid appears discolored (should be clear, colorless to pale yellow). Total volume of reconstituted vaccine will be ~0.5 mL. Administer vaccine within 30 minutes of preparation (90 minutes for Varilrix [Canadian product]).</p><h2>Administration</h2><p><b>SubQ:</b> For SubQ injection only; inject in the outer aspect of upper arm or the anterolateral thigh. Do not administer IV or IM; however, if inadvertently given IM, response is unlikely to be affected and repeating the dose to give SubQ is not necessary (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). Administer immediately following reconstitution. Varilrix (Canadian product) is to be administered in the deltoid region only. Do not mix with other vaccines or injections; separate needles and syringes should be used for each injection (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). To prevent syncope related injuries, patients should be vaccinated while seated or lying down (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). US law requires that the date of administration, the vaccine manufacturer, lot number of vaccine, Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) edition date and date it was provided, and the administering person's name, title, and address be recorded.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Prior to reconstitution and during shipping, store vaccine in freezer at -50°C to -15°C (-58°F to 5°F).

Cases are often associated with preceding or concurrent herpes zoster rash.</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute illness: Although fever is a contraindication per the manufacturer, current guidelines allow for administration to patients with mild acute illness with or without low grade fever (CDC/ACIP [Marin 2007]). Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Use of this vaccine is contraindicated in persons who are immunosuppressed or immunodeficient. Household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive most age appropriate vaccines (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). Live vaccines should be administered ≥4 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression and avoided within 2 weeks of immunosuppression when feasible; live vaccines should not be administered for at least 3 months after immunosuppressive therapy (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p>• HIV: Children ≤8 years of age with HIV infection with age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentages ≥15% may receive live attenuated varicella vaccine. Vaccination may also be considered for children &gt;8 years of age, adolescents, and adults with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts ≥200 cells/microliter; refer to guidelines for specific information (CDC/ACIP [Marin 2007]).</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Antibody-containing products: Varicella vaccine and antibody-containing products (eg, immune globulin, blood products) should <b>not</b> be administered simultaneously. Guidelines with suggested administration intervals are available (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Antiviral drugs: Medications active against the herpesvirus family (eg, acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir) may interfere with the varicella vaccine; avoid varicella vaccination to a patient who has received these antivirals 24 hours before vaccination; avoid use of these antiviral agents for 14 days after varicella vaccination (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Salicylates: Avoid salicylates in children and adolescents 12 months through 17 years of age for 6 weeks after vaccination; varicella may increase the risk of Reye syndrome.</p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist. The use of combination vaccines is generally preferred over separate injections, taking into consideration provider assessment, patient preference, and adverse events. When using combination vaccines, the minimum age for administration is the oldest minimum age for any individual component; the minimum interval between dosing is the greatest minimum interval between any individual components (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Albumin: Products may contain albumin.</p><p>• Gelatin: Products may contain gelatin. Use is contraindicated in patients with a history of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction to gelatin.</p><p>• Neomycin: Products may contain neomycin. Use is contraindicated in patients with history of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions to neomycin. Contact dermatitis due to neomycin is not a contraindication to the vaccine (CDC/ACIP [Marin 2007]).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use:</p><p>- Use of this vaccine for specific medical and/or other indications (eg, immunocompromising conditions, hepatic or kidney disease, diabetes) is also addressed in the annual ACIP Recommended Immunization Schedules (refer to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] schedule for detailed information). Specific recommendations for use of this vaccine in immunocompromised patients with asplenia, cancer, HIV infection, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, cochlear implants, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (prior to or after), sickle cell disease, solid organ transplant (prior to or after), or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for chronic conditions as well as contacts of immunocompromised patients are available from the IDSA (Rubin 2014).</p><p>- Varilrix and Varivax III [Canadian products]: Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) suggests that Varivax III and Varilrix may also be used for select groups (NACI 2017). Consult product labeling and/or NACI for specific recommendations regarding appropriate use in high risk patients.</p><p>• Antipyretics: Antipyretics have not been shown to prevent febrile seizures; antipyretics may be used to treat fever or discomfort following vaccination (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). One study reported that routine prophylactic administration of acetaminophen prior to vaccination to prevent fever decreased the immune response of some vaccines; the clinical significance of this reduction in immune response has not been established (Prymula 2009).</p><p>• Congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency: Defer use in patients with a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency until immune competence in the vaccine recipient is demonstrated (CDC/ACIP [Marin 2007]).</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Transmission of virus: Transmission of varicella vaccine virus resulting in varicella infection may occur (rare) between vaccine recipients (with or without varicella-like rash) and contacts susceptible to varicella (including healthy and high-risk individuals). The manufacturer notes that vaccinated individuals should not have close association with susceptible high-risk individuals for up to 6 weeks following vaccination. High-risk individuals include immunocompromised persons, pregnant women without evidence of immunity, newborns of mothers without evidence of immunity, and all infants born &lt;28 weeks' gestation (regardless of maternal immunity). However, the CDC recommends that vaccine recipients who develop a vaccine-related rash avoid contact with susceptible individuals at high risk for complications until the lesions are resolved (crusted over or fade away) or until no new lesions appear for 24 hours. According to the CDC guidelines, having a pregnant household member is not a contraindication to vaccination (CDC/ACIP [Marin 2007]).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Rash, fever; monitor for anaphylaxis and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Varicella virus vaccine is contraindicated for use in patients planning to become pregnant within 3 months (per manufacturer labeling); pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month (per ACIP) following vaccination (CDC/ACIP [Marin 2007]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Varicella virus vaccine is contraindicated for use in pregnant patients.</p><p>Information related to pregnancy and fetal outcomes following inadvertent exposure to the varicella virus vaccine was collected from 1995-2013 using the manufacturer's pregnancy registry. Data was available from 905 women who received a varicella containing vaccine (30% within 3 months prior to conception) and who had known pregnancy outcomes. Among these women, the rates of miscarriage and birth defects was not increased above background rates, and there were no infants born with abnormalities consistent with congenital varicella syndrome. Postmarketing data collected since closure of the pregnancy registry has not detected new safety concerns or an increased risk of major birth defects following inadvertent varicella vaccine exposure during pregnancy (Woodward 2019).</p><p>Varicella disease during the first or second trimesters may result in congenital varicella syndrome. The onset of maternal varicella infection from 5 days prior to 2 days after delivery may cause varicella infection in the newborn. All women should be assessed for immunity during a prenatal visit; those without evidence of immunity should be vaccinated upon completion or termination of pregnancy (CDC/ACIP [Marin 2007]).</p><p>Although the pregnancy registry is closed, any exposures to the vaccine during pregnancy or within 3 months prior to pregnancy should be reported to the manufacturer (Merck &amp; Co, 877-888-4231) or to VAERS (800-822-7967) as suspected adverse reactions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to prevent chickenpox infection.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
