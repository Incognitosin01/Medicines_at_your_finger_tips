To avoid contamination, do not touch tube tip to eyelids or other surfaces when placing ointment in eye(s).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (Ophthalmic): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Corticosteroids (Ophthalmic). Healing of ophthalmic tissue during concomitant administration of ophthalmic products may be delayed.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>See individual agents.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Infection: Steroids may mask infection, enhance existing ocular infection, or reactivate latent disease (eg, herpes infection of cornea); prolonged use may result in secondary bacterial or fungal superinfection due to immunosuppression. Lack of prompt clinical response may indicate resistance to therapy and warrant discontinuation of therapy and further evaluation.</p><p>• Neomycin sensitization: Neomycin may cause cutaneous sensitization. Symptoms of neomycin sensitization include itching, reddening, edema, and failure to heal. Discontinuation of product and avoidance of similar products should be considered.</p><p>• Ocular effects: Avoid prolonged use of corticosteroids, which may result in ocular hypertension and/or glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Use with caution in glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure (routinely if duration of therapy is &gt;10 days). Long-term use may cause corneal and scleral thinning; potentially resulting in perforation. Ophthalmic ointments may retard corneal wound healing.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For topical use only. Do not inject subconjunctivally or introduce directly into anterior chamber of the eye. Use following ocular cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of filtering blebs. Inadvertent contamination of multiple-dose ophthalmic tube tip has caused bacterial keratitis. Use of topical corticosteroids to prevent scarring in the healing stages of herpes simplex infection should be done with extreme caution and close observation; may reactivate disease. A maximum of 8 g should be prescribed initially; reevaluate patients (eg, intraocular pressure and exams using magnification and fluorescein staining, where appropriate) prior to additional refills. Use &gt;10 days should include routine monitoring of intraocular pressure.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>If ophthalmic ointment is used &gt;10 days or in patients with glaucoma, monitor intraocular pressure (IOP).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
C

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Adverse events have been observed with topical corticosteroids in animal reproduction studies. If ophthalmic agents are needed during pregnancy, the minimum effective dose should be used in combination with punctal occlusion to decrease potential exposure to the fetus (Samples, 1988). Refer to individual agents.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat or prevent eye infections.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
