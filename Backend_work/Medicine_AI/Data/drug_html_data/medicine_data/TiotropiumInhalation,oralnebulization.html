COPD is a lung disease that also includes chronic bronchitis (swelling of the tubes leading to the lungs) and emphysema (damage to the air sacs in the lungs). It is also used as maintenance treatment for asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older.</p><p>Tiotropium belongs to the family of medicines known as bronchodilators. Bronchodilators are breathed in through the mouth to help open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. It is taken by inhalation (an inhaler) and will increase the flow of air to the lungs.</p><p>Tiotropium is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using tiotropium</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For tiotropium, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to tiotropium or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of inhaled tiotropium to treat asthma in children 6 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy of inhaled tiotropium have not been established to treat asthma in children younger than 6 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of inhaled tiotropium in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking tiotropium, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using tiotropium with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of tiotropium</h2><p><i>Use tiotropium only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using tiotropium or any asthma medicine without telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance of having breathing problems.</p><p>Tiotropium usually comes with patient instructions. Read them carefully before using the medicine. If you do not understand the instructions or have questions about using the inhaler, talk to your doctor.</p><p>Use tiotropium at the same time each day.</p><p><i>Spiriva®</i> capsules should only be used with the <i>HandiHaler®</i> device. Do not swallow the capsule. <i>Spiriva®</i> capsules should only be inhaled through your mouth (oral inhalation). Do not use the <i>HandiHaler®</i> device with any other medicine.</p><p>Do not allow the powder from the capsules to get in your eyes. If the powder does get in your eyes, it may cause blurred vision and pupil dilation (increased pupil size). If this happens, call your doctor right away.</p><p><i>To use the Spiriva® HandiHaler®</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Open the HandiHaler® device and the blister containing the capsule.</li>
<li>Put one capsule into the HandiHaler® device.</li>
<li>Press and then release the green piercing button on the side of the HandiHaler® device. Do not press the green button more than once.</li>
<li>Breathe out fully. Do not breathe into the mouthpiece of the HandiHaler® device.</li>
<li>Hold the HandiHaler® base, put the mouthpiece between your lips, and close your lips around the mouthpiece.</li>
<li>Breathe in slowly and deeply through your mouth as you can hear or feel the Spiriva® capsule vibrate. Do not breathe through your nose.</li>
<li>Hold your breath and remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Then, breathe normally again.</li>
<li>After you are finished, open the mouthpiece and remove the used Spiriva® capsule and throw it away. Do not store any used or unused capsule in the HandiHaler® device.</li>
<li>Rinse the HandiHaler® device with warm water and keep it dry.</li>
</ul><p><i>To use the Spiriva® Respimat® inhaler</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Take the inhaler and cartridge out of the carton before you use it for the first time.</li>
<li>Do not use the inhaler for tiotropium with any other medicine.</li>
<li>Push the narrow end of the cartridge into the inhaler. About 1/8 of an inch will remain visible when the cartridge is correctly inserted.</li>
<li>Do not turn the clear base before inserting the cartridge.</li>
<li>Do not remove the cartridge once it has been inserted in the inhaler.</li>
<li>Flip the aqua cap until it snaps fully open. Turn the clear base in the direction of the black arrows on the label until it clicks (half a turn).</li>
<li>When you use the inhaler for the first time, or if you have not used it for 3 days or longer, it may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first puff. Before using the inhaler, prime it by spraying the medicine 3 times into the air away from the face.</li>
<li>To inhale tiotropium, breathe out fully, trying to get as much air out of the lungs as possible. Put the mouthpiece fully into your mouth and close your lips around it. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue.</li>
<li>While pressing down firmly and fully on the dose release button of the inhaler, breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for the next puff.</li>
<li>Close the aqua cap after taking your medicine.</li>
<li>The inhaler has a window that shows the number of doses that are left. The counter will turn red when the inhaler has few doses left. This will remind you to refill your prescription.</li>
<li>Clean the inhaler mouthpiece daily with a damp cloth or tissue only, at least once a week.</li>
<li>Throw away the inhaler after 3 months from its first use.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of tiotropium will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label.
