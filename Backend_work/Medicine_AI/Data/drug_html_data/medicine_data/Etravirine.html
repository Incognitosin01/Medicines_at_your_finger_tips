HIV causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Etravirine is not a cure for HIV or AIDS.</p><p>Etravirine is for use in adults and children who are at least 2 years old.</p><p>Etravirine may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Etravirine must be taken in combination with other HIV medications. However, some drugs can raise or lower your blood levels of etravirine. Etravirine can also affect blood levels of certain other drugs. This can make your medicines less effective or increase side effects. TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT ALL OTHER MEDICINES YOU USE.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not take etravirine if you are allergic to it.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had liver disease, including hepatitis B or C.</p><p>Etravirine must be taken in combination with other HIV medications. However, there are certain combinations of medicines that should not be used together with etravirine. Tell your doctor about all your current medicines and any medicine you start or stop using.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant. <b>Your dose needs may be different during pregnancy.</b> Use your medications properly to control your infection. HIV can be passed to your baby if the virus is not controlled during pregnancy.</p><p>Your name may be listed on a registry to track any effects of antiviral medicine on the baby.</p><p>Women with HIV or AIDS should not breast-feed a baby. Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk.</p><h2>How should I take etravirine?</h2><p>Etravirine must be given in combination with other antiviral medications and it should not be used alone.</p><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Etravirine works best if you take it after a meal. Do not take it on an empty stomach.</p><p>Etravirine doses are based on weight in children. Your child's dose needs may change if the child gains or loses weight.</p><p>Do not crush, chew, or break an etravirine tablet. Swallow it whole with liquid such as water.</p><p>If you cannot swallow a tablet whole, place it into a glass with a teaspoon of water. Stir until the water looks milky. Add a tablespoon more water (or a tablespoon of orange juice, milk, or sports drink). Drink this mixture right away. Add more liquid to the glass, swirl gently and drink right away. Keep adding and drinking liquid until the entire dose is rinsed from the glass.</p><p>You will need frequent medical tests.</p><p>Store the tablets in their original container at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.</p><p>Use all HIV medications as directed and read all medication guides you receive. Do not change your dose or dosing schedule without your doctor's advice. Every person with HIV should remain under the care of a doctor.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine after your next meal, but skip the missed dose if you are more than 6 hours late for the dose. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><p>Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking etravirine?</h2><p>Using  etravirine will not prevent your disease from spreading.
