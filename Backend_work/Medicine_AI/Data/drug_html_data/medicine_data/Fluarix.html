Fluarix is approved for use in persons 3 years of age and older.</span></p><h2>Fluarix Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Preparation for Administration</h3><p class="First">Shake well before administration. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered.</p><h3>Recommended Dose and Schedule</h3><p class="First">Fluarix should be administered as an intramuscular injection preferably in the region of the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Children:</span> Children 3 years to &lt;9 years of age previously unvaccinated or vaccinated for the first time last season with only one dose receive two 0.5 mL doses; each 0.5 mL dose is administered at least 4 weeks apart.</span></p><p> <span class="following_xmChange">Children 3 years to &lt;9 years of age who have been previously vaccinated with 2 doses of any influenza vaccine receive only one 0.5 mL dose.</span></p><p> <span class="following_xmChange">Children 9 years of age and older receive only one 0.5 mL dose.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Adults:</span> Administer as a single 0.5 mL dose.</p><p>  Do not administer this product intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously.</p><p>Do not inject in the gluteal area or areas where there may be a major nerve trunk.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Fluarix is a suspension available in 0.5-mL single-dose prefilled TIP-LOK<span class="Sup">®</span> syringes.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Do not administer Fluarix to anyone with known systemic hypersensitivity reactions to egg proteins (a vaccine component) or a life-threatening reaction to previous administration of any influenza vaccine <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Guillain-Barré Syndrome</h3><p class="First">  If Guillain-Barré syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior influenza vaccine, the decision to give Fluarix should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks.</p><h3>Latex</h3><p class="First">The tip caps of the prefilled syringes may contain natural rubber latex which may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)]</span>.</p><h3>Altered Immunocompetence</h3><p class="First">If Fluarix is administered to immunosuppressed persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the immune response may be lower than in immunocompetent persons.</p><h3>Preventing and Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions</h3><p class="First">Prior to administration, the healthcare provider should review the patient's immunization history for possible vaccine sensitivity and previous vaccination-related adverse reactions. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of Fluarix.</p><h3>Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness</h3><p class="First">Vaccination with Fluarix may not protect all susceptible individuals.</p><h3>Persons at Risk of Bleeding</h3><p class="First">  As with other intramuscular injections, Fluarix should be given with caution in individuals with bleeding disorders such as hemophilia or on anticoagulant therapy, to avoid the risk of hematoma following the injection.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine, and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There is the possibility that broad use of Fluarix could reveal adverse reactions not observed in clinical trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults:</span> In adults, the most common local adverse reactions and general adverse events observed with Fluarix were pain and redness at the injection site, muscle aches, fatigue, and headache.</p><p>Fluarix has been administered to 10,317 adults 18 to 64 years of age and 606 subjects ≥65 years of age in 4 clinical trials.</p><p>One of the 4 clinical trials was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated a total of 952 subjects: Fluarix (N = 760) and placebo (N = 192). The population was 18 to 64 years of age (mean 39.1), 54% were female and 80% were white. Solicited events were collected for 4 days (day of vaccination and the next 3 days) (Table 1). Unsolicited events that occurred within 21 days of vaccination (day 0-20) were recorded using diary cards supplemented by spontaneous reports and a medical history as reported by subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1.

In the total population, 60% were female and 99.9% were white. In a subset (Fluarix [N = 305] and placebo [N = 155]), unsolicited events that occurred within 21 days of vaccination (day 0-20) were recorded on diary cards. The percentage of subjects reporting at least one unsolicited event was similar among the groups (24.3% for Fluarix and 22.6% for placebo). Unsolicited adverse events that occurred in ≥1% of recipients of Fluarix and at a rate greater than placebo included injection site pain (5.2% versus 1.3%), dysmenorrhea (1.3% versus 0.6%), and migraine (1.0% versus 0.0%).</p><p><span class="Italics">Incidence of Adverse Events Reported in ≥1% of Subjects in Non-US Clinical Trials:</span> The following additional adverse events have been observed in adults in non-US clinical trials with Fluarix.

This list includes serious events or events which have causal connection to Fluarix. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the vaccine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders:</span> Lymphadenopathy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac Disorders:</span> Tachycardia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Ear and Labyrinth Disorders:</span> Vertigo.</p><p><span class="Bold">Eye Disorders:</span> Conjunctivitis, eye irritation, eye pain, eye redness, eye swelling, eyelid swelling.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Disorders:</span> Abdominal pain or discomfort, nausea, swelling of the mouth, throat, and/or tongue.</p><p><span class="Bold">General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:</span> Asthenia, chest pain, chills, feeling hot, injection site mass, injection site reaction, injection site warmth, body aches.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immune System Disorders:</span> Anaphylactic reaction including shock, anaphylactoid reaction, hypersensitivity, serum sickness.</p><p><span class="Bold">Infections and Infestations:</span> Injection site abscess, injection site cellulitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, tonsillitis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders:</span> Pain in extremity.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nervous System Disorders:</span> Convulsion, dizziness, encephalomyelitis, facial palsy, facial paresis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypoesthesia, myelitis, neuritis, neuropathy, paresthesia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders:</span> Asthma, bronchospasm, cough, dyspnea, respiratory distress, stridor.</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:</span> Angioedema, erythema, erythema multiforme, facial swelling, pruritus, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, urticaria.</p><p><span class="Bold">Vascular Disorders:</span> Henoch-Schönlein purpura, vasculitis.</p><h3>Adverse Events Associated With Influenza Vaccines</h3><p class="First">Immediate and presumably allergic reactions (e.g., hives, angioedema, allergic asthma, and systemic anaphylaxis) rarely occur after influenza vaccination. These reactions probably result from hypersensitivity to certain vaccine components, such as residual egg protein. Although Fluarix contains only a limited quantity of egg protein, this protein can induce immediate hypersensitivity reactions among persons who have severe egg allergy <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p>The 1976 swine influenza vaccine was associated with an increased frequency of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Evidence for a causal relation of GBS with subsequent vaccines prepared from other influenza viruses is unclear. If influenza vaccine does pose a risk, it is probably slightly more than 1 additional case/1 million persons vaccinated.</p><p>Neurological disorders temporally associated with influenza vaccination such as encephalopathy, optic neuritis/neuropathy, partial facial paralysis, and brachial plexus neuropathy have been reported.</p><p>Microscopic polyangitis (vasculitis) has been reported temporally associated with influenza vaccination.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Concomitant Vaccine Administration</h3><p class="First">Fluarix should not be mixed with any other vaccine in the same syringe or vial.</p><p>There are insufficient data to assess the concurrent administration of Fluarix with other vaccines.</p><h3>Immunosuppressive Therapies</h3><p class="First">Immunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic drugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune response to Fluarix.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">  Pregnancy Category B</p><p>A reproductive and developmental toxicity study has been performed in female rats at a dose approximately 56 times the human dose (on a mg/kg basis) and revealed no evidence of impaired female fertility or harm to the fetus due to Fluarix. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Fluarix should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><p>In a reproductive and developmental toxicity study, the effect of Fluarix on embryo-fetal and pre-weaning development was evaluated in pregnant rats. Animals were administered Fluarix by intramuscular injection once prior to gestation, and during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6, 8, 11, and 15), 0.1 mL/rat/occasion (approximately 56-fold excess relative to the projected human dose on a body weight basis). No adverse effects on mating, female fertility, pregnancy, parturition, lactation parameters, and embryo-fetal or pre-weaning development were observed. There were no vaccine-related fetal malformations or other evidence of teratogenesis.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether Fluarix is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Fluarix is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The immune response of Fluarix has been evaluated in children 6 months to &lt;5 years of age. In a randomized, controlled study, serum hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody titers were lower in children 6 months to &lt;3 years of age compared to a US-licensed vaccine. Immune responses in children 3 years to &lt;5 years of age receiving Fluarix or a US-licensed vaccine have been evaluated <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>. Safety has been evaluated in children 6 months to &lt;18 years of age. The frequencies of solicited adverse events for children 3 years to &lt;5 years of age and for children 5 years to &lt;18 years of age were similar for Fluarix and the comparator vaccine <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">A randomized, single-blind, active-controlled study evaluated immunological non-inferiority in a cohort of subjects ≥65 years of age who received Fluarix (N = 606) or another US-licensed trivalent, inactivated influenza virus vaccine (N = 604) (Sanofi Pasteur SA). In subjects receiving Fluarix or the comparator vaccine, geometric mean antibody titers post-vaccination were lower in geriatric subjects than in younger subjects (18 to 64 years of age). Fluarix was non-inferior to the comparator vaccine for each of the 3 influenza strains based on mean antibody titers and seroconversion rates. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.2).]</span> Solicited local and general adverse events were similar for Fluarix and the comparator vaccine among geriatric subjects (Table 2). For both vaccines, the frequency of solicited events in subjects ≥65 years of age was lower than in younger subjects (Table 2). <span class="Italics">[See Adverse Reactions (6.1).]</span></p><h2>Fluarix Description</h2><p class="First">Fluarix, Influenza Virus Vaccine, for intramuscular injection, is a sterile colorless to slightly opalescent suspension. Fluarix is a vaccine prepared from influenza viruses propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. Each of the influenza viruses is produced and purified separately. After harvesting the virus-containing fluids, each influenza virus is concentrated and purified by zonal centrifugation using a linear sucrose density gradient solution containing detergent to disrupt the viruses. Following dilution, the vaccine is further purified by diafiltration. Each influenza virus solution is inactivated by the consecutive effects of sodium deoxycholate and formaldehyde leading to the production of a “split virus.” Each split inactivated virus is then suspended in sodium phosphate-buffered isotonic sodium chloride solution. The vaccine is formulated from the 3 split inactivated virus solutions.</p><p>Fluarix has been standardized according to USPHS requirements for the 2010-2011 influenza season and is formulated to contain 45 micrograms (mcg) hemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5-mL dose, in the recommended ratio of 15 mcg HA of each of the following 3 strains: A/California/7/2009 NYMC X-181 (H1N1), A/Victoria/210/2009 NYMC X-187 (H3N2) (an A/Perth/16/2009-like virus),and B/Brisbane/60/2008.</p><p>Fluarix is formulated without preservatives. Fluarix does not contain thimerosal. Each 0.5-mL dose also contains octoxynol-10 (TRITON<span class="Sup">®</span> X-100) ≤0.085 mg, α-tocopheryl hydrogen succinate ≤0.1 mg, and polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) ≤0.415 mg. Each dose may also contain residual amounts of hydrocortisone ≤0.0016 mcg, gentamicin sulfate ≤0.15 mcg, ovalbumin ≤0.05 mcg, formaldehyde ≤5 mcg, and sodium deoxycholate ≤50 mcg from the manufacturing process.</p><p>The tip caps of the prefilled syringes may contain natural rubber latex. The rubber plungers do not contain latex.</p><h2>Fluarix - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Influenza illness and its complications follow infection with influenza viruses. Global surveillance of influenza identifies yearly antigenic variants. For example, since 1977, antigenic variants of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) viruses and influenza B viruses have been in global circulation. Specific levels of hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody titer post-vaccination with inactivated influenza virus vaccines have not been correlated with protection from influenza illness but the HI antibody titers have been used as a measure of vaccine activity. In some human challenge studies, HI antibody titers of ≥1:40 have been associated with protection from influenza illness in up to 50% of subjects.<span class="Sup">1,2</span> Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers little or no protection against another virus. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virological basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual incorporation of one or more new strains in each year’s influenza vaccine. Therefore, inactivated influenza vaccines are standardized to contain the hemagglutinins of strains (i.e., typically 2 type A and 1 type B), representing the influenza viruses likely to circulate in the United States in the upcoming winter.</p><p>Annual revaccination with the current vaccine is recommended because immunity declines during the year after vaccination, and because circulating strains of influenza virus change from year to year.<span class="Sup">3</span></p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Fluarix has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of fertility.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Efficacy Against Culture-Confirmed Influenza</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of Fluarix was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 2 European countries during the 2006-2007 influenza season. Efficacy of Fluarix, containing A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004 influenza strains, was defined as the prevention of culture-confirmed influenza A and/or B cases, for vaccine antigenically matched strains, compared with placebo. Healthy subjects 18 to 64 years of age (mean 39.9 years) were randomized (2:1) to receive Fluarix (N = 5,103) or placebo (N = 2,549) and monitored for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) starting 2 weeks post vaccination and lasting for approximately 7 months. In the overall population, 60% of subjects were female and 99.9% were white. Culture-confirmed influenza was assessed by active and passive surveillance of ILI. Influenza-like illness was defined as at least one general symptom (fever ≥100°F and/or myalgia) and at least one respiratory symptom (cough and/or sore throat). After an episode of ILI, nose and throat swab samples were collected for analysis; attack rates and vaccine efficacy were calculated (Table 4).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4.

In subjects 50 to 64 years of age, vaccine efficacy was 13.8% (95% CI: -137.0, 66.3) [number of influenza cases: Fluarix (n = 14/1,501) and placebo (n = 8/739)]. As the study lacked statistical power to evaluate efficacy within age subgroups, the clinical significance of these results is unknown.</p><h3>Immunological Evaluation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults:</span> In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in healthy subjects 18 to 64 years of age (mean 39.1 years) in the United States, the immune responses to each of the antigens contained in Fluarix were evaluated in sera obtained 21 days after administration of Fluarix (N = 745) and were compared to those following administration of a placebo vaccine (N = 190). In the overall population, 54% of subjects were female and 80% were white.

Subjects 18 to 64 years and ≥65 years of age were evaluated for immune responses to each of the vaccine antigens 21 days following vaccination <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span>. In the overall population, 59% of subjects were female and 91% were white. The co-primary immunogenicity endpoints were geometric mean titers (GMTs) of serum HI antibodies and the percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversion, defined as at least a 4-fold increase in serum HI titer over baseline to ≥1:40, following vaccination. The primary immunogenicity analyses were performed on the According-to-Protocol (ATP) cohort which included all eligible and evaluable subjects with results of at least one serological assay. For each of the influenza antigens, the GMTs and the percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversion are presented in Table 6. Fluarix was non-inferior to the comparator influenza vaccine based on antibody GMTs (upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMT ratio [comparator influenza vaccine/Fluarix] ≤1.5) and seroconversion rates (upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI on difference of the comparator influenza vaccine minus Fluarix ≤10%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 6.

The immune responses to each of the antigens contained in Fluarix formulated for the 2006-2007 season were evaluated in sera obtained after 1 or 2 doses of Fluarix (N = 426) and were compared to those following administration of the comparator influenza vaccine (N = 445). Further details on the clinical study design and demographic information have been previously described <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>Non-inferiority of the immune response for Fluarix to comparator influenza vaccine for subjects 6 months to &lt;5 years of age was not demonstrated mainly due to lower antibody response to Fluarix compared to the comparator influenza vaccine in subjects 6 months to &lt;3 years of age. In subjects 3 years to &lt;5 years of age, Fluarix met at least one of the pre-specified criteria for demonstration of non-inferiority (GMT and seroconversion rate) for the influenza A strains but not for the influenza B strain. Seroconversion rates and the percentage of subjects with HI titers ≥1:40 were analyzed as secondary endpoints. In subjects 3 years to &lt;5 years of age, the lower limit of the 95% Confidence Interval of the seroconversion rate for Fluarix or the comparator influenza vaccine exceeded 40% for all 3 strains; also in this age group, the lower limit of the 95% Confidence Interval of the rate with HI titer ≥1:40 for Fluarix or the comparator influenza vaccine exceeded 70% for both A strains (Table 7).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 7.
