Indicated for the relief of local symptoms, such as inflammation, hypermotility, and pain, which accompany lower urinary tract infections. Indicated for the relief of urinary tract symptoms caused by diagnostic procedures.<br/></p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First">FOR ORAL USE ONLY<br/>
<span class="Bold">Adults:</span> One tablet 4 times per day by mouth, followed by liberal fluid intake.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Older Children:</span> Dosage must be individualized by physician.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Not recommended for use in children younger than six years.</span><br/></p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Darpaz is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to any of its ingredients. Risk benefits should be carefully considered when the following medical problems exist: achalasia of esophagus, atony of colon, diseases of cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal hemorrhage; glaucoma; hemolytic anemia from pyruvate kinase and G6PD deficiencies, infected urolithiasis, myasthenia gravis, paralytic ileus, severe ulcerative colitis, toxic megacolon; acute urinary retention may be precipitated in obstructive uropathy (such as bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy).<br/></p><h2>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Do not exceed recommended dosage. This drug may make you dizzy or drowsy or cause blurred vision; use caution while driving, using machinery, or doing any activity that requires alertness or clear vision. Limit alcohol consumption. Cross sensitivity and/or related problems – patients intolerant of belladonna alkaloids or salicylates may be intolerant of this medication also. Delay in gastric emptying could complicate the management of gastric ulcers. There have been no studies to establish the safety of prolonged use of this product in humans. No known long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C:</span> Hyoscyamine Sulfate and Methenamine cross the placenta. Studies have not been done in animals or humans. It is not known whether Darpaz tablets cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Darpaz tablets should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> Problems in humans have not been documented; however, Methenamine and traces of Hyoscyamine Sulfate are excreted in breast milk. Accordingly, Darpaz tablets should be given to a lactating woman only if clearly needed. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effect of the belladonna alkaloids (Hyoscyamine Sulfate). This product contains salicylate, which is related to aspirin. Children and teenagers should not take aspirin, aspirin-containing or aspirin-related medications if they have chickenpox, influenza, or any undiagnosed illness without first consulting a doctor. A rare but serious illness known as Reye’s syndrome may occur. This medication is not recommended for children younger than 6 years.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Geriatric Use:</span> Kidney function becomes impaired with age. This medication is removed by the kidneys. Therefore, use with caution in elderly patients as they may respond to usual doses of Hyoscyamine Sulfate with excitement, agitation, drowsiness or confusion.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First"><br/>
Cardiovascular: rapid heartbeat, flushing<br/>
Central Nervous System: blurred vision, dizziness, drowsiness<br/>
Genitourinary: difficulty micturition, acute urinary retention<br/>
Gastrointestinal: dry mouth nausea and vomiting<br/>
Respiratory: shortness of breath or trouble breathing<br/>
<br/>
Serious allergic reactions to this drug are rare. Seek immediate medical attention if you notice symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including itching, rash, severe dizziness, swelling or trouble breathing.<br/>
<br/>
This medication can cause urine and sometimes stools to turn blue-green. This effect is harmless and will subside after medication is stopped.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Call your doctor or physician for medical advice about side effects. The following number does not provide medical advice, but in the U.S. you may report suspected side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.<br/></span><br/></p><h2>DRUG INTERACTIONS:</h2><p class="First"><br/>
This drug should not be used with the following medications because very serious interactions may occur: live influenza virus vaccine, pramlintide. Because of this products effect on gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying, it may decrease the absorption of other oral medications during concurrent use such as: urinary alkalizers; thiazide diuretics (may cause the urine to become alkaline reducing the effectiveness of Methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde); antimuscarinics (concurrent use may intensify antimuscarinic effects of Hyoscyamine Sulfate because of secondary antimuscarinic activities of these medications); antacids/antidiarrheals (may reduce absorption of Hyoscyamine Sulfate, concurrent use with antacids may cause urine to become alkaline, reducing effectiveness of Methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde). Doses of these medications should be spaced 1 hour apart from doses of Hyoscyamine Sulfate; antimyasthenics  (concurrent use with Hyoscyamine Sulfate may further reduce intestinal motility); ketoconazole (patients should be advised to take this combination at least 2 hours after ketoconazole); monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use may intensify antimuscarinic side effects), opioid (narcotic analgesics may result in increased risk of severe constipation); sulfonamides (these drugs may precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine, increasing the danger of crystalluria). This is not a complete list of all drug interactions. Tell your doctor or pharmacist of all presprtion mediations prior to use.<br/></p><h2>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE:</h2><p class="First">A dependence on the use of Darpaz has not been reported nor expected based on the pharmacology of the ingredients contained in Darpaz.<br/></p><h2>OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First">By exceeding the recommended dosage of Darpaz, symptomology related to the overdose of its individual active ingredients may be expected as follows:<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Hyoscyamine Sulfate:</span> Symptoms associated with overdosage of Darpaz will most probably be manifested in the symptoms related to overdosage of alkaloid Hyoscyamine Sulfate. Such symptoms as dryness of mucous membranes; dilation of pupils, hot, dry, flushed skin; hyperpyrexia; tachycardia; palpitations; elevated blood pressure; coma; circulatory collapse and death from respiratory failure can occur due to overdosage of these alkaloids.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Methenamine:</span> If large amounts of the drug (2-8 g daily) are used over extended periods (3-4 weeks), bladder and gastrointestinal irritation, painful and frequent micturition, albuminuria and gross hematuria may be expected.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Phenyl Salicylate:</span> Symptoms of Phenyl Salicylate overdosage include burning pain in throat and mouth, white necrotic lesions in the mouth, abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, pallor, sweating, weakness, headache, dizziness and tinnitus. The symptoms, however, are not expected to be discernible from those associated with the other active ingredients in Darpaz.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Sodium Biphosphate:</span> Symptoms of Sodium Biphosphate overdosage may include diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Methylene Blue:</span> Symptoms of Methylene Blue overdosage associated with the overdosage of Darpaz are not expected to be discernible from those associated with other active ingredients in Darpaz.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment:</span> Emesis or gastric lavage. Slow intravenous administration of physostigmine in doses of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 mg to 1 mg in children), repeated as needed in one to two hours to reverse severe antimuscarinic symptoms.<br/></p><p>Administration of small doses of diazepam or baclofen to control excitement and seizures. Artificial respiration with oxygen if needed for respiratory depression. Adequate re-hydration is required. Symptomatic treatment as determined by a doctor.<br/>
<br/>
If overdose is suspected, contact your local poison center or emergency room immediately. US residents can contact the US National Poison Hotline at 1-800-222-1222.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hyoscyamine Sulfate:</span><br/>
Hyoscyamine Sulfate is a parasympatholytic which relaxes smooth muscles and thus produces an antispasmodic effect. It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly distributed throughout the body tissues. Following oral administration, the drug has an onset of action of 20 to 30 minutes. The half-life is 3.5 hours. Hyoscyamine is distributed throughout the body, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and is approximately 50% bound to plasma proteins. It is metabolized in the liver to tropic acid, tropine, and Hyoscyamine glucuronide. Hyoscyamine is excreted primarily unchanged in the urine within 12 hours. Its biotransformation is hepatic.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Methenamine:</span><br/>
Methenamine, after oral administration, undergoes hydrolysis and gernerates formaldehyde, which provides bactericaldal or bacteriostatic action. Methenamine is rapidly absorbed from the intestinal tract and is excreted, for the most part, unchanged in the urine at which point it is hydrolyzed if the urine is acidic. It is almost completely excreted (90%) in the urine within 24 hours; of this at a pH of 5, approximately 10-30% is converted to formaldehyde in the stomach.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Phenyl Salicylate:</span><br/>
Phenyl Salicylate, a form of salicylic acid, is a mild analgesic for pain relief.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Sodium Biphosphate:</span><br/>
Sodium Biphosphate increases urinary acidity helping to maintain an acid pH necessary for the degradation or methenamine.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Methylene Blue:</span><br/>
Methylene Blue is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor with weak antiseptic properties. It is well absorbed by the intestinal tract and rapidly reduced to leukomethylene blue, which is stabilized in the urine. Approximately 70-80% is excreted unchanged in the urine.<br/>
