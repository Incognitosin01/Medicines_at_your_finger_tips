</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Ajovy Injection</h2><p class="First">AJOVY is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.</p><h2>Ajovy Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosage</h3><p class="First">Two subcutaneous dosing options of AJOVY are available to administer the recommended dosage:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>225 mg monthly, or</li>
<li>675 mg every 3 months (quarterly), which is administered as three consecutive subcutaneous injections of 225 mg each.</li>
</ul><p>When switching dosage options, administer the first dose of the new regimen on the next scheduled date of administration. If a dose of AJOVY is missed, administer as soon as possible. Thereafter, AJOVY can be scheduled from the date of the last dose.</p><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">AJOVY is for subcutaneous use only.</p><p>AJOVY may be administered by healthcare professionals, patients, and/or caregivers. Prior to use, provide proper training to patients and/or caregivers on the preparation and administration of AJOVY prefilled syringe, including aseptic technique <span class="Italics">[see Instructions for Use]</span>:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Remove AJOVY from the refrigerator. Prior to use, allow AJOVY to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes protected from direct sunlight. Do not warm by using a heat source such as hot water or a microwave. Do not use AJOVY if it has been at room temperature for 7 days or longer</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="following_xmChange">[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2)].</span></span></li>
<li>Follow aseptic injection technique every time AJOVY is administered.</li>
<li>Inspect AJOVY for particles or discoloration prior to administration <span class="Italics">[see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3)]</span>. Do not use if the solution is cloudy, discolored, or contains particles.</li>
<li>Administer AJOVY by subcutaneous injection into areas of the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm that are not tender, bruised, red, or indurated. For multiple injections, you may use the same body site, but not the exact location of the previous injection.</li>
<li>Do not co-administer AJOVY with other injectable drugs at the same injection site.</li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">AJOVY is a sterile, clear to opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution, available as follows:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Injection: 225 mg/1.5 mL single-dose prefilled autoinjector</li>
<li>Injection: 225 mg/1.5 mL single-dose prefilled syringe</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">AJOVY is contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to fremanezumab-vfrm or to any of the excipients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, pruritus, drug hypersensitivity, and urticaria, were reported with AJOVY in clinical trials. Most reactions were mild to moderate, but some led to discontinuation or required corticosteroid treatment. Most reactions were reported from within hours to one month after administration.</p><p>If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, consider discontinuing AJOVY, and institute appropriate therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Hypersensitivity Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The safety of AJOVY was evaluated in 2512 patients with migraine who received at least 1 dose of AJOVY, representing 1279 patient-years of exposure. Of these, 1730 patients were exposed to AJOVY 225 mg monthly or AJOVY 675 mg quarterly for at least 6 months, 775 patients for at least 12 months, and 138 patients for at least 15 months. In placebo-controlled clinical trials (Studies 1 and 2), 662 patients received AJOVY 225 mg monthly for 12 weeks (with or without a loading dose of 675 mg), and 663 patients received AJOVY 675 mg quarterly for 12 weeks <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. In the controlled trials, 87% of patients were female, 80% were White, and the mean age was 41 years.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions in the clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine (incidence at least 5% and greater than placebo) were injection site reactions. The adverse reactions that most commonly led to discontinuations were injection site reactions (1%). Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported in the 3-month placebo-controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2), and the 1-month follow-up period after those studies.</p><p class="First">Injection site reactions<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p><span class="Sup">a </span>Injection site reactions include multiple related adverse event terms, such as injection site pain, induration, and erythema.</p><h3>Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to fremanezumab-vfrm in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies to other products may be misleading. Clinical immunogenicity of AJOVY was monitored by analyzing anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies in drug-treated patients. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to AJOVY in specific assays.</p><p>In 3-month placebo-controlled studies, treatment-emergent ADA responses were observed in 6 out of 1701 (0.4%) AJOVY-treated patients. One of the 6 patients developed anti-AJOVY neutralizing antibodies at Day 84. In the ongoing long-term open-label study, ADA were detected in 1.6% of patients (30 out of 1888). Out of 30 ADA-positive patients, 17 had a neutralizing activity in their post-dose samples. Although these data do not demonstrate an impact of anti-fremanezumab-vfrm antibody development on the efficacy or safety of AJOVY in these patients, the available data are too limited to make definitive conclusions.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of AJOVY in pregnant women. AJOVY has a long half-life <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. This should be taken into consideration for women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while using AJOVY. Administration of fremanezumab-vfrm to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis or to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses resulting in plasma levels greater than those expected clinically did not result in adverse effects on development <span class="Italics">[see </span><span class="Italics">Animal Data]</span>. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The estimated rate of major birth defects (2.2-2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</span></p><p>Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension during pregnancy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>When fremanezumab-vfrm (0, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg) was administered to male and female rats by weekly subcutaneous injection prior to and during mating and continuing in females throughout organogenesis, no adverse embryofetal effects were observed. The highest dose tested was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) approximately 2 times that in humans at a dose of 675 mg.</p><p>Administration of fremanezumab-vfrm (0, 10, 50, or 100 mg/kg) weekly by subcutaneous injection to pregnant rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis produced no adverse effects on embryofetal development. The highest dose tested was associated with plasma AUC approximately 3 times that in humans (675 mg).</p><p>Administration of fremanezumab-vfrm (0, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg) weekly by subcutaneous injection to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in no adverse effects on pre- and postnatal development. The highest dose tested was associated with plasma AUC approximately 2 times that in humans (675 mg).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of fremanezumab-vfrm in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for AJOVY and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from AJOVY or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of AJOVY did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p><h2>Ajovy Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Fremanezumab-vfrm is a fully humanized IgG2Δa/kappa monoclonal antibody specific for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand. Fremanezumab-vfrm is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The antibody consists of 1324 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kDa.</p><p>AJOVY (fremanezumab-vfrm) injection is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution for subcutaneous injection, supplied in a single-dose 225 mg/1.5 mL prefilled autoinjector and a single-dose 225 mg/1.5 mL prefilled syringe.</p><p>Each prefilled autoinjector or prefilled syringe delivers 1.5 mL of solution containing 225 mg fremanezumab-vfrm, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid dihydrate (EDTA) (0.204 mg), L-histidine (0.815 mg), L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (3.93 mg), polysorbate-80 (0.3 mg), sucrose (99 mg), and Water for Injection, and has a pH of 5.5.</p><h2>Ajovy Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Fremanezumab-vfrm is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand and blocks its binding to the receptor.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The relationship between the pharmacodynamic activity and the mechanism(s) by which fremanezumab-vfrm exerts its clinical effects is unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>After single subcutaneous (SC) administrations of 225 mg, 675 mg, and 900 mg fremanezumab-vfrm, median time to maximum concentrations (tmax) was 5 to 7 days. Dose-proportionality, based on population PK, was observed between 225 mg to 900 mg. Steady state was achieved by approximately 168 days (about 6 months) following 225 mg SC monthly and 675 mg SC quarterly dosing regimens. Median accumulation ratio, based on once-monthly and once-quarterly dosing regimens, is approximately 2.3 and 1.2, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Fremanezumab-vfrm has an apparent volume of distribution of approximately 6 liters, suggesting minimal distribution to the extravascular tissues.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Similar to other monoclonal antibodies, fremanezumab-vfrm is degraded by enzymatic proteolysis into small peptides and amino acids.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Fremanezumab-vfrm apparent clearance was approximately 0.141 L/day. Fremanezumab-vfrm was estimated to have a half-life of approximately 31 days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>A population PK analysis assessing effects of age, race, sex, and weight was conducted on data from 2287 subjects. No dose adjustments are recommended for AJOVY.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Hepatic/renal impairment is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of fremanezumab. A population PK analysis of integrated data from the AJOVY clinical studies did not reveal a difference in the pharmacokinetics of fremanezumab in patients with mild hepatic impairment, relative to those with normal hepatic function. There were only 4 patients with moderate hepatic impairment, and no patient with severe hepatic impairment in fremanezumab clinical studies. No dedicated hepatic/renal impairment studies were conducted to assess the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of fremanezumab.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>Fremanezumab is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes; therefore, interactions with concomitant medications that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely. Additionally, the effects of medications for the acute treatment (specifically analgesics, ergots, and triptans) and preventive treatment of migraine were evaluated in a population PK model, and found not to influence fremanezumab exposure.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>Carcinogenicity studies of fremanezumab-vfrm were not conducted.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Genetic toxicology studies of fremanezumab-vfrm were not conducted.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>When fremanezumab-vfrm (0, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg) was administered to male and female rats by weekly subcutaneous injection prior to and during mating and continuing in females throughout organogenesis, no adverse effects on male or female fertility were observed. The highest dose tested was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) approximately 2 times that in humans at a dose of 675 mg.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of AJOVY was evaluated as a preventive treatment of episodic or chronic migraine in two multicenter, randomized, 3-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2, respectively).</p><p><span class="Italics">Episodic Migraine</span></p><p>Study 1 (NCT 02629861) included adults with a history of episodic migraine (patients with &lt;15 headache days per month). All patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous injections of either AJOVY 675 mg every three months (quarterly), AJOVY 225 mg monthly, or placebo monthly, over a 3-month treatment period. Patients were allowed to use acute headache treatments during the study. A subset of patients (21%) was allowed to use one additional concomitant preventive medication.</p><p>The study excluded patients with a history of significant cardiovascular disease, vascular ischemia, or thrombotic events, such as cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in the monthly average number of migraine days during the 3-month treatment period.
