</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for AirDuo Digihaler</h2><p class="First">AirDuo<span class="Sup">®</span>Digihaler™ is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients aged 12 years and older. AirDuo Digihaler should be used for patients not adequately controlled on a long term asthma control medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid or whose disease warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and long acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span> adrenergic agonist (LABA).</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span>:</p><p>AirDuo Digihaler is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.</p><h2>AirDuo Digihaler Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Administer AirDuo Digihaler as 1 inhalation twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart at the same time every day) by the orally inhaled route. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing after each inhalation. </p><ul class="Disc">
<li>AirDuo Digihaler does not require priming.</li>
<li>Do not use AirDuo Digihaler with a spacer or volume holding chamber.</li>
<li>Do not use AirDuo Digihaler by other routes.</li>
<li>Do not use more than two times every 24 hours. More frequent administration or a greater number of daily inhalations (more than one inhalation twice daily) is not recommended as some patients are more likely to experience adverse reactions with higher salmeterol dosages.</li>
<li>Avoid the concomitant use of other long acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span> adrenergic agonist (LABAs) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.11)].</span></li>
</ul><p>If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist should be taken for immediate relief.</p><h3>Recommended Dosage</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dosage for AirDuo Digihaler is based on asthma severity and current inhaled corticosteroid use and strength.  For example:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>For patients not taking inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (with less severe asthma): select 55/14 mcg (55 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 14 mcg of salmeterol), administered twice daily.</li>
<li>For patients with greater asthma severity, use the higher dosages: either:
<ul class="Circle">
<li>113/14 mcg (113 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 14 mcg of salmeterol), administered twice daily; or</li>
<li>232/14 mcg (232 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 14 mcg of salmeterol), administered twice daily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For patients switching to AirDuo Digihaler from another inhaled corticosteroid or combination product, select the low (55/14 mcg), medium (113/14 mcg) or high (232/14 mcg) dose strength of AirDuo Digihaler based on the strength of the previous inhaled corticosteroid product, or the strength of the inhaled corticosteroid from a combination product, and disease severity.</li>
</ul><ul class="Circle">
<li>113/14 mcg (113 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 14 mcg of salmeterol), administered twice daily; or</li>
<li>232/14 mcg (232 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 14 mcg of salmeterol), administered twice daily.</li>
</ul><p>Improvement in asthma control following AirDuo Digihaler administration can occur within 15 minutes of beginning treatment; although, maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 week or longer after starting treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dosage after 2 weeks of therapy, consider increasing the strength (replace with a higher strength) to possibly provide additional improvement in asthma control. The maximum recommended dosage of AirDuo Digihaler is 232/14 mcg twice daily.</p><p>If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide adequate improvement in asthma control, the therapeutic regimen should be reevaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g., replacing the current strength of AirDuo Digihaler with a higher strength, adding additional controller therapies) should be considered. After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the risk of adverse reactions.</p><h3>Storing and Cleaning the Inhaler</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Keep the inhaler in a cool dry place.</li>
<li>Routine maintenance is not required. If the mouthpiece needs cleaning, gently wipe the mouthpiece with a dry cloth or tissue as needed.</li>
<li>Never wash or put any part of the inhaler in water.</li>
</ul><h3>Dose Counter and Storage of Inhaler Events Data</h3><p class="First">The AirDuo Digihaler inhaler has a dose counter:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>The number 60 is displayed (prior to use).</li>
<li>The dose counter will count down each time the mouthpiece is opened and closed <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>.</li>
</ul><p>AirDuo Digihaler contains a built-in electronic module which detects, records, and stores data on inhaler events, including peak inspiratory flow rate (L/minute), for transmission to the mobile App where inhaler events are categorized. Use of the App is not required for administration of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol to the patient.  There is no evidence the use of the App leads to improved clinical outcomes, including safety and effectiveness <span class="Italics">[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]. </span><br/></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Inhalation Powder: AirDuo Digihaler is an inhalation-driven, multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI) with an electronic module, for oral inhalation that meters 55 mcg, 113 mcg, or 232 mcg of fluticasone propionate with 14 mcg of salmeterol from the device reservoir and delivers 49 mcg, 100 mcg, or 202 mcg of fluticasone propionate with 12.75 mcg of salmeterol, respectively, from the mouthpiece per actuation. The AirDuo Digihaler is a white inhaler with a yellow cap, and is provided in a sealed foil pouch with desiccant. AirDuo Digihaler contains a built-in electronic module <span class="Italics">[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Status Asthmaticus</h3><p class="First">AirDuo Digihaler is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">AirDuo Digihaler is contraindicated in patients with known severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins or who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Description (11)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Serious Asthma-Related Events – Hospitalizations, Intubations, Death</h3><p class="First">Use of LABA as monotherapy [without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)] for asthma is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics">Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART)]</span>. Available data from controlled clinical trials also suggest that use of LABA as monotherapy increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. These findings are considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy. When LABA are used in fixed-dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone <span class="Italics">[see </span><span class="Italics">Serious Asthma-Related Events with Inhaled Corticosteroid/Long-acting Beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic Agonists]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Serious Asthma-Related Events with</span> <span class="Bold">Inhaled Corticosteroid/Long-acting Beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic Agonists</span></p><p>Four large, 26-week, randomized, blinded, active-controlled clinical safety trials were conducted to evaluate the risk of serious asthma-related events when LABA were used in fixed-dose combination with ICS compared with ICS alone in subjects with asthma. Three (3) trials included adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older: 1 trial compared budesonide/formoterol to budesonide, 1 trial compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder to fluticasone propionate inhalation powder, and 1 trial compared mometasone furoate/formoterol to mometasone furoate. The fourth trial included pediatric subjects aged 4 to 11 years and compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder to fluticasone propionate inhalation powder. The primary safety endpoint for all 4 trials was serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death). A blinded adjudication committee determined whether events were asthma-related.</p><p>The 3 adult and adolescent trials were designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.0, and the pediatric trial was designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.7. Each individual trial met its pre-specified objective and demonstrated non-inferiority of ICS/LABA to ICS alone. A meta-analysis of the 3 adult and adolescent trials did not show a significant increase in risk of a serious asthma-related event with ICS/LABA fixed-dose combination compared with ICS alone (Table 1). These trials were not designed to rule out all risk for serious asthma-related events with ICS/LABA compared with ICS.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1.

Subjects can have one or more events, but only the first event was counted for analysis.  A single, blinded, independent adjudication committee determined whether events were asthma related.</p><p>The pediatric safety trial included 6,208 pediatric patients aged 4 to 11 years who received ICS/LABA (fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder) or ICS (fluticasone propionate inhalation powder). In this trial 27/3,107 (0.9%) of patients treated with ICS/LABA and 21/3,101 (0.7%) of patients treated with ICS experienced a serious asthma‑related event. There were no asthma-related deaths or intubations. ICS/LABA did not show a significantly increased risk of a serious asthma-related event compared to ICS based on the prespecified risk margin (2.7), with an estimated hazard ratio of time to first event of 1.29 (95% CI: 0.73, 2.27).</p><p><span class="Bold">Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART)</span></p><p>A 28-week, placebo-controlled, U.S. trial that compared the safety of salmeterol with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in subjects treated with salmeterol versus 3/13,179 in subjects treated with placebo; relative risk: 4.37 [95% CI: 1.25, 15.34]). Use of background ICS was not required in SMART. The increased risk of asthma‑related death is considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy.</p><h3>Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes</h3><p class="First">AirDuo Digihaler should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life‑threatening episodes of asthma. AirDuo Digihaler has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating asthma. The initiation of AirDuo Digihaler in this setting is not appropriate.</p><p>Serious acute respiratory events, including fatalities, have been reported when salmeterol, a component of AirDuo Digihaler, has been initiated in patients with significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. In most cases, these have occurred in patients with severe asthma (e.g., patients with a history of corticosteroid dependence, low pulmonary function, intubation, mechanical ventilation, frequent hospitalizations, previous life‑threatening acute asthma exacerbations) and in some patients with acutely deteriorating asthma (e.g., patients with significantly increasing symptoms; increasing need for inhaled, short‑acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>‑agonists; decreasing response to usual medications; increasing need for systemic corticosteroids; recent emergency room visits; deteriorating lung function). However, these events have occurred in a few patients with less severe asthma as well. It was not possible from these reports to determine whether salmeterol contributed to these events.</p><p>Increasing use of inhaled, short‑acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>‑agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma. In this situation, the patient requires immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for replacing the current strength of AirDuo Digihaler with a higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, or initiating systemic corticosteroids. Patients should not use more than 1 inhalation twice daily of AirDuo Digihaler.</p><p>AirDuo Digihaler should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. An inhaled, short‑acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>‑agonist, not AirDuo Digihaler, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath. When prescribing AirDuo Digihaler, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short‑acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist (e.g., albuterol) for treatment of acute symptoms, despite regular twice‑daily use of AirDuo Digihaler.</p><p>When beginning treatment with AirDuo Digihaler, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short‑acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>‑agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs.</p><h3>Excessive Use of AirDuo Digihaler and Use with Other Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists</h3><p class="First">AirDuo Digihaler should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using AirDuo Digihaler should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason.</p><h3>Local Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with <span class="Italics">Candida </span><span class="Italics">albicans</span> has occurred in subjects treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol MDPI. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with AirDuo Digihaler continues, but at times therapy with AirDuo Digihaler may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing following inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.</p><h3>Immunosuppression</h3><p class="First">Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible adolescents or adults using corticosteroids. In such patients who have not had these diseases or who have not been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</p><p>Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.</p><h3>Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy</h3><p class="First">Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal (HPA) function.</p><p>Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although AirDuo Digihaler may improve control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.</p><p>During periods of stress or a severe asthmatic attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physician for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a medical identification warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack.</p><p>Patients requiring systemic corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to AirDuo Digihaler. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>] or morning peak expiratory flow [AM PEF]), beta‑agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids. In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.</p><p>Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to AirDuo Digihaler may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions).</p><p>During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.</p><h3>Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression</h3><p class="First">Fluticasone propionate, a component of AirDuo Digihaler, will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since fluticasone propionate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of AirDuo Digihaler in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. A relationship between plasma levels of fluticasone propionate and inhibitory effects on stimulated cortisol production has been shown after 4 weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing AirDuo Digihaler.</p><p>Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with AirDuo Digihaler should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.</p><p>It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, AirDuo Digihaler should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids, and for management of asthma symptoms.</p><h3>Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">The use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with AirDuo Digihaler is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid and increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms</h3><p class="First">As with other inhaled medicines, AirDuo Digihaler can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life‑threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with inhaled fluticasone propionate/salmeterol medicines, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; inhaled fluticasone propionate/salmeterol medicines should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted. Upper airway symptoms of laryngeal spasm, irritation, or swelling, such as stridor and choking, have been reported in patients receiving inhaled fluticasone propionate/salmeterol medicines.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis</h3><p class="First">Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), including anaphylaxis, may occur after administration of AirDuo Digihaler. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of other powder products containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use AirDuo Digihaler <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Cardiovascular and Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">Excessive beta‑adrenergic stimulation has been associated with seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10.2)].</span> Therefore, AirDuo Digihaler, like all products containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.</p><p>Salmeterol, a component of AirDuo Digihaler, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of salmeterol at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta‑agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Large doses of inhaled or oral salmeterol (12 to 20 times the recommended dose) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias. Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.</p><h3>Reduction in Bone Mineral Density</h3><p class="First">Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long‑term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long‑term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care.</p><h3>Effect on Growth</h3><p class="First">Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including AirDuo Digihaler, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving AirDuo Digihaler routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including AirDuo Digihaler, titrate each patient’s dosage to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Glaucoma and Cataracts</h3><p class="First">Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients following the long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate, a component of AirDuo Digihaler. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.</p><p>Effects of treatment with other Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol Inhalation Powder 500/50, fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, salmeterol 50 mcg, or placebo on development of cataracts or glaucoma was evaluated in a subset of 658 subjects with COPD in the 3-year survival trial. Ophthalmic examinations were conducted at baseline and at 48, 108, and 158 weeks. Conclusions about cataracts cannot be drawn from this trial because the high incidence of cataracts at baseline (61% to 71%) resulted in an inadequate number of subjects treated with other Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol Inhalation Powder 500/50 who were eligible and available for evaluation of cataracts at the end of the trial (n = 53). The incidence of newly diagnosed glaucoma was 2% with other Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol Inhalation Powder 500/50, 5% with fluticasone propionate, 0% with salmeterol, and 2% with placebo.</p><h3>Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome</h3><p class="First">In rare cases, patients on inhaled fluticasone propionate, a component of AirDuo Digihaler, may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg‑Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of fluticasone propionate. Cases of serious eosinophilic conditions have also been reported with other inhaled corticosteroids in this clinical setting. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between fluticasone propionate and these underlying conditions has not been established.</p><h3>Coexisting Conditions</h3><p class="First">AirDuo Digihaler, like all medicines containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta<span class="Sub">2</span>‑adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.</p><h3>Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia</h3><p class="First">Beta‑adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Clinically significant changes in blood glucose and/or serum potassium were seen infrequently during clinical trials with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol multidose dry powder inhaler (AIRDUO RESPICLICK hereafter referred to as fluticasone propionate/salmeterol MDPI) at recommended doses.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Use of LABA may result in the following</span>:</p><ul class="Disc">

No formal drug interaction trials have been performed with AirDuo Digihaler.</p><h3>Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4</h3><p class="First">Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol, the individual components of AirDuo Digihaler, are substrates of CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with AirDuo Digihaler is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid and increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur.</p><p><span class="Bold">Ritonavir</span>: <span class="Italics">Fluticasone Propionate:</span> A drug interaction trial with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray in healthy subjects has shown that ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression.</p><p><span class="Bold">Ketoconazole</span>: <span class="Italics">Fluticasone Propionate:</span> Coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in a 1.9‑fold increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure and a 45% decrease in plasma cortisol area under the curve (AUC) but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol.</p><p><span class="Italics">Salmeterol:</span> In a drug interaction trial in 20 healthy subjects, coadministration of inhaled salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and oral ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in greater systemic exposure to salmeterol (AUC increased 16‑fold and C<span class="Sub">max</span> increased 1.4‑fold). Three (3) subjects were withdrawn due to beta<span class="Sub">2</span>‑agonist side effects (2 with prolonged QTc and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants</h3><p class="First">AirDuo Digihaler should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of salmeterol, a component of AirDuo Digihaler, on the vascular system may be potentiated by these agents.</p><h3>Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blocking Agents</h3><p class="First">Beta‑blockers not only block the pulmonary effect of beta‑agonists, such as salmeterol, a component of AirDuo Digihaler, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta‑blockers. However, under certain circumstances, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta‑adrenergic blocking agents for these patients; cardioselective beta‑blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.</p><h3>Non-Potassium-Sparing Diuretics</h3><p class="First">The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non–potassium‑sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta‑agonists, such as salmeterol, a component of AirDuo Digihaler, especially when the recommended dose of the beta‑agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of AirDuo Digihaler with non–potassium‑sparing diuretics.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no randomized clinical studies of AirDuo Digihaler or individual monoproducts, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol, in pregnant women. There are clinical considerations with the use of AirDuo Digihaler in pregnant women <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Considerations]</span>.  Animal reproduction studies are available with the combination of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol as well as individual components. In animals, teratogenicity characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal variations, in rats, mice, and rabbits were observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the maximum recommended human daily inhaled dose (MRHDID) on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. However, fluticasone propionate administered via inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. Experience with oral corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. Oral administration of salmeterol to pregnant rabbits caused teratogenicity characteristic of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation at maternal doses approximately 700 times the MRHDID on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. These adverse effects generally occurred at large multiples of the MRHDID when salmeterol was administered by the oral route to achieve high systemic exposures. No such effects occurred at an oral salmeterol dose approximately 420 times the MRHDID <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>.</p><p>The estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease‑Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</span></p><p>In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma, there is an increased risk of several perinatal adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age in the neonate. Pregnant women with asthma should be closely monitored and medication adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal asthma control.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol:</span>  In an embryo/fetal development study with pregnant rats that received the combination of subcutaneous administration of fluticasone propionate and oral administration of salmeterol at doses of 0/1000, 30/0, 10/100, 30/1000, and 100/10,000 mcg/kg/day (as fluticasone propionate/salmeterol) during the period of organogenesis, findings were generally consistent with the individual monoproducts and there was no exacerbation of expected fetal effects. Omphalocele, increased embryo/fetal deaths, decreased body weight, and skeletal variations were observed in rat fetuses, in the presence of maternal toxicity, when combining fluticasone propionate at a dose approximately 2 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 100 mcg/kg/day) and a dose of salmeterol at approximately 3500 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 10,000 mcg/kg/day). The rat no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was observed when combining fluticasone propionate at a dose 0.6 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mcg/kg/day) and a dose of salmeterol at approximately 350 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 1000 mcg/kg/day).</p><p>In an embryo/fetal development study with pregnant mice that received the combination of subcutaneous administration of fluticasone propionate and oral administration of salmeterol at doses of 0/1400, 40/0, 10/200, 40/1400, or 150/10,000 mcg/kg/day (as fluticasone propionate/salmeterol) during the period of organogenesis, findings were generally consistent with the individual monoproducts and there was no exacerbation of expected fetal effects. Cleft palate, fetal death, increased implantation loss, and delayed ossification were observed in mouse fetuses when combining fluticasone propionate at a dose approximately 1.4 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 150 mcg/kg/day) and salmeterol at a dose approximately 1470 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 10,000 mcg/kg/day). No developmental toxicity was observed at combination doses of fluticasone propionate up to approximately 0.8 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 40 mcg/kg) and doses of salmeterol up to approximately 420 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 1400 mcg/kg).</p><p><span class="Italics">Fluticasone Propionate:</span>  In embryo/fetal development studies with pregnant rats and mice dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate was teratogenic in both species. Omphalocele, decreased body weight, and skeletal variations were observed in rat fetuses, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 2 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 100 mcg/kg/day). The rat NOAEL was observed at approximately 0.6 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mcg/kg/day). Cleft palate and fetal skeletal variations were observed in mouse fetuses at a dose approximately 0.5 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 45 mcg/kg/day). The mouse NOAEL was observed with a dose approximately 0.16 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 15 mcg/kg/day).</p><p>In an embryo/fetal development study with pregnant rats dosed by the inhalation route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced decreased fetal body weights and skeletal variations, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 0.5 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal inhalation dose of 25.7 mcg/kg/day); however, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. The NOAEL was observed with a dose approximately 0.1 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal inhalation dose of 5.5 mcg/kg/day).</p><p>In an embryo/fetal development study in pregnant rabbits that were dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced reductions of fetal body weights, in the presence of maternal toxicity at doses approximately 0.02 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.57 mcg/kg/day). Teratogenicity was evident based upon a finding of cleft palate for 1 fetus at a dose approximately 0.2 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcg/kg/day). The NOAEL was observed in rabbit fetuses with a dose approximately 0.004 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.08 mcg/kg/day).</p><p>In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant rats dosed by the subcutaneous route from late gestation through delivery and lactation (Gestation Day 17 to Postpartum Day 22), fluticasone propionate was not associated with decreases in pup body weight, and had no effects on developmental landmarks, learning, memory, reflexes, or fertility at doses up to approximate equivalence to the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with maternal subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg/day).</p><p>Fluticasone propionate crossed the placenta following subcutaneous administration to mice and rats and oral administration to rabbits.</p><p><span class="Italics">Salmeterol:</span> In three embryo/fetal development studies, pregnant rabbits received oral administration of salmeterol at doses ranging from 100 to 10,000 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. In pregnant Dutch rabbits administered salmeterol doses approximately 700 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at maternal oral doses of 1000 mcg/kg/day and higher), fetal toxic effects were observed characteristically resulting from beta‑adrenoceptor stimulation. These included precocious eyelid openings, cleft palate, sternebral fusion, limb and paw flexures, and delayed ossification of the frontal cranial bones. No such effects occurred at a salmeterol dose approximately 420 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 600 mcg/kg/day). New Zealand White rabbits were less sensitive since only delayed ossification of the frontal cranial bones was seen at a salmeterol dose approximately 7,000 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 10,000 mcg/kg/day).</p><p>In two embryo/fetal development studies, pregnant rats received salmeterol by oral administration at doses ranging from 100 to 10,000 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. Salmeterol produced no maternal toxicity or embryo/fetal effects at doses up to 3500 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at maternal oral doses up to 10,000 mcg/kg/day).</p><p>In a peri-and post-natal development study in pregnant rats dosed by the oral route from late gestation through delivery and lactation, salmeterol at a dose 3500 times the MRHDID (on mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal oral dose of 10,000 mcg/kg/day) was fetotoxic and decreased the fertility of survivors.</p><p>Salmeterol xinafoate crossed the placenta following oral administration to mice and rats.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no available data on the presence of fluticasone propionate or salmeterol in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Other corticosteroids have been detected in human milk. However, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.

Use of AirDuo Digihaler for this indication was supported by evidence from two adequate and well-controlled trials in pediatric patients 12 years old and older with persistent symptomatic asthma despite ICS or ICS/LABA therapy (Trials 1 and 2) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]. </span> In these trials, 58 adolescents received fluticasone propionate/salmeterol MDPI one inhalation twice daily.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of AirDuo Digihaler in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.</p><p>Inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate, a component of AirDuo Digihaler, may cause a reduction in growth velocity in adolescents <span class="Italics">[see Warning and Precautions (5.13)]</span>. The growth of pediatric patients receiving ICS, including AirDuo Digihaler, should be monitored.</p><p>If an adolescent on any corticosteroid appears to have growth suppression, the possibility that he/she is particularly sensitive to this effect of corticosteroids should be considered. In such patients, the potential growth effects of prolonged ICS treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained. To minimize the systemic effects of ICS, including AirDuo Digihaler, each patient should be titrated to the lowest strength that effectively controls his/her asthma <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed in data collected in 54 subjects aged 65 years and older versus younger subjects who were treated with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol MDPI in placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 asthma studies. </p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Formal pharmacokinetic studies using AirDuo Digihaler have not been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. However, since both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol are predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)],</span> impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Formal pharmacokinetic studies using AirDuo Digihaler have not been conducted in patients with renal impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">AirDuo Digihaler contains both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to AirDuo Digihaler. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of AirDuo Digihaler together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta‑receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm.

The opening of the mouthpiece cover meters 5.5 mg of the formulation from the device reservoir, which contains 55 mcg, 113 mcg, or 232 mcg of fluticasone propionate, and 14 mcg of salmeterol base (equivalent to 20.3 mcg of salmeterol xinafoate). Patient inhalation through the mouthpiece causes the deagglomeration and aerosolization of the drug particles as the formulation moves through the cyclone component of the device. This is followed by dispersion into the airstream.</p><p>Under standardized in vitro test conditions, the AirDuo Digihaler inhaler delivers 49 mcg, 100 mcg, or 202 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 12.75 mcg of salmeterol base (equivalent to 18.5 mcg of salmeterol xinafoate), with lactose from the mouthpiece when tested at a flow rate of 85 L/min for 1.4 seconds.</p><p>The amount of drug delivered to the lung will depend on patient factors such as inspiratory flow profiles. In adult subjects (N=50, aged 18 to 45 years) with asthma, mean peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the MDPI was 108.28 L/min (range: 70.37 to 129.24 L/min). In adolescent subjects (N=50, aged 12 to 17 years) with asthma, mean peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the MDPI was 106.72 L/min (range: 73.64 to 125.51 L/min).</p><p>AirDuo Digihaler includes a QR code (on the top of the inhaler), and contains a built-in electronic module which automatically detects, records and stores data on inhaler events, including peak inspiratory flow rate (L/min). AirDuo Digihaler may pair with and transmit data to the mobile App where inhaler events are categorized.</p><h2>AirDuo Digihaler - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">AirDuo Digihaler</span>: AirDuo Digihaler contains both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol. The mechanisms of action described below for the individual components apply to AirDuo Digihaler. These drugs represent 2 different classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a LABA) that have different effects on clinical, physiologic, and inflammatory indices.</p><p><span class="Bold">Fluticasone Propionate</span>: Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in humans are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.</p><p>Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma.</p><p><span class="Bold">Salmeterol</span>: Salmeterol is a selective LABA. In vitro studies show salmeterol to be at least 50 times more selective for beta<span class="Sub">2</span>‑adrenoceptors than albuterol. Although beta<span class="Sub">2</span>‑adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta<span class="Sub">1</span>‑adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta<span class="Sub">2</span>‑adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta‑adrenoceptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta<span class="Sub">2</span>‑agonists may have cardiac effects.</p><p>The pharmacologic effects of beta<span class="Sub">2</span>‑adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including salmeterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.</p><p>In vitro tests show that salmeterol is a potent and long‑lasting inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D<span class="Sub">2</span>, from human lung. Salmeterol inhibits histamine‑induced plasma protein extravasation and inhibits platelet‑activating factor‑induced eosinophil accumulation in the lungs of guinea pigs when administered by the inhaled route. In humans, single doses of salmeterol administered via inhalation aerosol attenuate allergen‑induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal Axis Effects (HPA)</span></p><p>There are no HPA data from controlled trials of the AirDuo Digihaler in healthy subjects or subjects with asthma.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular Effects and Effects on Potassium and Glucose</span></p><p><span class="Italics">AirDuo Digihaler in Healthy Subjects </span></p><p>There were no clinical trials conducted with AirDuo Digihaler that assessed cardiovascular (CV) effects in healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Other Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) Products in Healthy Subjects</span></p><p>Since systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol are not normally seen at the maximum approved salmeterol dosage, higher doses were used to produce measurable effects.

<li>AirDuo Digihaler combines the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) medicine fluticasone propionate and the LABA medicine salmeterol.</li>
<li>ICS medicines such as fluticasone propionate help to decrease inflammation in the lungs. Inflammation in the lungs can lead to breathing problems.</li>
<li>LABA medicines such as salmeterol help the muscles around the airways in your lungs stay relaxed to prevent symptoms, such as wheezing, cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These symptoms can happen when the muscles around the airways tighten. This makes it hard to breathe.</li>
<li>AirDuo Digihaler is a prescription medicine used to control symptoms of asthma and to prevent symptoms such as wheezing in people 12 years of age and older.</li>
<li>AirDuo Digihaler contains a built-in electronic module that records and stores information about inhaler events. AirDuo Digihaler may be used with, and transmits information to, an App through Bluetooth® wireless technology.</li>

<li>AirDuo Digihaler contains salmeterol. LABA medicines such as salmeterol when used alone increase the risk of hospitalizations and death from asthma problems. AirDuo Digihaler contains an ICS and a LABA. When an ICS and LABA are used together, there is not a significant increased risk in hospitalizations and death from asthma problems.</li>
<li>AirDuo Digihaler is not for people 12 years of age and older with asthma who are well controlled with an asthma control medicine, such as a low or medium dose of an inhaled corticosteroid medicine. AirDuo Digihaler is for people 12 years of age and older with asthma who need both an ICS and LABA medicine.</li>
