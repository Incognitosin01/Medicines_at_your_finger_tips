This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For galcanezumab-gnlm, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to galcanezumab-gnlm or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of galcanezumab-gnlm injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of galcanezumab-gnlm injection in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur.

It is given as a shot under your skin, usually in the stomach, thighs, upper arm, or buttocks. You or your caregiver may be trained to prepare and inject galcanezumab-gnlm at home. Be sure that you understand how to use the medicine.</p><p>If you use galcanezumab-gnlm at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections. Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, red, bruised, or hard.</p><p>Galcanezumab-gnlm comes with a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Galcanezumab-gnlm is available in two forms: a <i>prefilled syringe</i> or a <i>prefilled pen</i>, which you can use at home.</p><p>Check the liquid in the prefilled syringe.

Do not shake.</p><p>Allow the medicine to warm to room temperature for at least 30 minutes before you use it. Do not warm it in any other way.</p><p>Do not remove the needle cap from the <i>prefilled syringe</i> until you are ready to use it.</p><p>You might not use all of the medicine in each prefilled syringe or pen.
