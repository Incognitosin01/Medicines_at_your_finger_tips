For a list of factors that may increase the risk of NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers and their complications <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Diclofenac and Misoprostol Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5)]</span>.</p><p>After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.</p><p>For the relief of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, the dosage is given below.</p><p>Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is administered as diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 (50 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol) or as diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 (75 mg diclofenac sodium and 200 mcg misoprostol).<br/>
Note: See <span class="Italics">Special Dosing Considerations</span> section below.</p><p>For osteoarthritis, the dosage for maximal GI mucosal protection is diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 three times a day. For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75 two times a day or diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 two times a day can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers.

This fixed combination product, diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, is not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dose of both ingredients. Doses of the components delivered with these regimens are as follows:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Special Dosing Considerations:</span></p><p>Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol contains misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>, and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients.</p><p>Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be changed to the appropriate dose of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, or use of the individual components to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. The total dose of misoprostol should not exceed 800 mcg/day, and no more than 200 mcg of misoprostol should be administered at any one time. Doses of diclofenac sodium higher than 150 mg/day in osteoarthritis or higher than 225 mg/day in rheumatoid arthritis are not recommended.</p><p>When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the total daily dose of diclofenac should not exceed the lowest recommended dose of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 two times a day.</p><p>For additional information, it may be helpful to refer to the prescribing information for the individual products of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Delayed-release tablets:</p><ul>

</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in the following patients:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions) to diclofenac sodium and misoprostol, other prostaglandins, or any components of the drug product <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.9)]</span></li>
<li>History of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, sometimes fatal, anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8)]</span></li>
<li>In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Pregnancy. Use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol during pregnancy can result in maternal and fetal harm, including abortion, premature birth, birth defects, and uterine rupture <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span></li>
<li>Active gastrointestinal bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p><p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</span></p><p>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Post-MI Patients</span></p><p>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</p><p>Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2%–4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</span></p><p>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.</li>
<li>Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.</li>
<li>Avoid use in patients at high risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.</li>
<li>Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.</li>
<li>If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium/misoprostol until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.</li>
<li>In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</li>
</ul><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, meaningful elevation of ALT (SGPT, more than 3 times the ULN [ULN = the upper limit of the normal range]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component.</p><p>In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of AST (SGOT) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies).</p><p>In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2–6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3–8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations.</p><p>In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.</p><p>In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days.</p><p>Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</p><p>If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium/misoprostol should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium/misoprostol immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium/misoprostol with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics).</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><h3>Heart Failure and Edema</h3><p class="First">The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</p><p>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Toxicity</span></p><p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.</p><p>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span> Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span>.</p><p>Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. When diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium/misoprostol has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.</p><p>NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Masking of Inflammation and Fever</h3><p class="First">The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><h3>Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 50 or diclofenac sodium/misoprostol 75, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal</span></p><p>GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium/misoprostol. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium/misoprostol and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><p>Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone.</p><p>Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is prescribed.

Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause abortion, premature birth, birth defects or uterine rupture. Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of fetal ductus arteriosus <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span> There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</span>. In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, discontinue the drug and advise the woman of the potential risks to her and to a fetus.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eight week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium/misoprostol, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete.</p><p>Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses.

Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Misoprostol</span></p><p>Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs.</p><p>Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both.</p><p>In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained.</p><p>Misoprostol, over the range of 50–200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion.</p><p>Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation.

The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 to 400 mcg.

Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively. The diclofenac in diclofenac sodium/misoprostol is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum.

Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, 0.16 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology</h3><p class="First">A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae.

Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3).</p><p>Results of a study in 572 patients with osteoarthritis demonstrate that patients receiving diclofenac sodium/misoprostol have a lower incidence of endoscopically defined gastric ulcers compared to patients receiving diclofenac sodium (see Table 4).</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed release tablets are supplied as:</p><ul>
