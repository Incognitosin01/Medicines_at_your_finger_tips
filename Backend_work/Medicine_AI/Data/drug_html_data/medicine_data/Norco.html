An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic. Acetaminophen is a less potent pain reliever that increases the effects of hydrocodone.</p><p>Norco is used to relieve moderate to moderately severe pain.</p><p>Norco may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Hydrocodone can slow or stop your breathing.</b> Never use Norco in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. <b>Opioid pain medicine may be habit-forming, even at regular doses.</b> Never share Norco with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it.</p><p><b>MISUSE OF NARCOTIC MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b></p><p>Do not use Norco if you have used a MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days, such as isocarboxazid, linezolid, methylene blue injection, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, or tranylcypromine.</p><p><b>An overdose of acetaminophen can damage your liver or cause death.</b> Call your doctor at once if you have nausea, pain in your upper stomach, itching, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-colored stools, or jaundice (yellowing of your skin or eyes).</p><p><b>Stop taking Norco and call your doctor right away if you have skin redness or a rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Norco if you are allergic to acetaminophen (Tylenol) or hydrocodone, or if you have recently used alcohol, sedatives, tranquilizers, or other narcotic medications.</p><p>Do not use Norco if you have taken a MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days. A dangerous drug interaction could occur. MAO inhibitors include isocarboxazid, linezolid, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, and tranylcypromine.</p><p>Some medicines can interact with hydrocodone and cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Be sure your doctor knows if you also take medicine for depression, mental illness, Parkinson's disease, migraine headaches, serious infections, or prevention of nausea and vomiting. Ask your doctor before making any changes in how or when you take your medications.</p><p>You should not use this medicine if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>severe asthma or breathing problems; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a blockage in your stomach or intestines.</p>

Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p><b>Ask a doctor before using opioid medicine if you are breastfeeding.</b> Tell your doctor if you notice severe drowsiness or slow breathing in the nursing baby.</p><h2>How should I take Norco?</h2><p>Take Norco exactly as prescribed. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Never take this medicine in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. An overdose can damage your liver or cause death. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain.</p><p>Hydrocodone may be habit-forming, even at regular doses. Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. <b>MISUSE OF NARCOTIC MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Selling or giving away Norco is against the law.</p><p>If you need surgery or medical tests, tell the doctor ahead of time that you are using this medicine. You may need to stop using the medicine for a short time.</p><p>Do not stop using this medicine suddenly after long-term use, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using Norco.</p><p>Store Norco at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep track of the amount of medicine used from each new bottle. Hydrocodone is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Always check your bottle to make sure you have received the correct pills (same brand and type) of medicine prescribed by your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose of Norco for Pain:</b></p><p>Tablets:<br/>
Recommended dose:<br/>
Acetaminophen-hydrocodone 300 mg-5 mg: 1 to 2 tablets orally every 4 to 6 hours as needed<br/>
Maximum dose:<br/>
Acetaminophen-hydrocodone 300 mg-5 mg: 8 tablets daily<br/>
Comments:<br/>
Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of the pain and the response of the patient. Tolerance to hydrocodone can develop with continued use and the incidence of side effects is dose related.<br/>
<br/>
Approved indication: For the relief of moderate to moderately severe pain</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Norco is taken as needed, you may not be on a dosing schedule. If you are taking the medication regularly, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>A hydrocodone overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Overdose symptoms may include severe drowsiness, pinpoint pupils, slow breathing, or no breathing.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend you get naloxone (a medicine to reverse an opioid overdose) and keep it with you at all times. A person caring for you can give the naloxone if you stop breathing or don't wake up. Your caregiver must still get emergency medical help and may need to perform CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on you while waiting for help to arrive.</p><p>Anyone can buy naloxone from a pharmacy or local health department. Make sure any person caring for you knows where you keep naloxone and how to use it.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What to avoid</h2><p>This medication may impair your thinking or reactions. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how Norco will affect you. Dizziness or severe drowsiness can cause falls or other accidents.</p><p>Ask a doctor or pharmacist before using any other cold, allergy, pain, or sleep medication. Acetaminophen (sometimes abbreviated as APAP) is contained in many combination medicines. <b>Taking certain products together can cause you to get too much acetaminophen which can lead to a fatal overdose.</b> Check the label to see if a medicine contains acetaminophen or APAP.</p><p>Avoid drinking alcohol. It may increase your risk of liver damage while taking acetaminophen.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Norco side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Norco:</b> hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p><b>Opioid medicine can slow or stop your breathing, and death may occur.</b> A person caring for you should give naloxone and/or seek emergency medical attention if you have slow breathing with long pauses, blue colored lips, or if you are hard to wake up.</p><p><b>In rare cases, acetaminophen may cause a severe skin reaction that can be fatal.</b> This could occur even if you have taken acetaminophen in the past and had no reaction. <b>Stop taking this medicine and call your doctor right away if you have skin redness or a rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling.</b> If you have this type of reaction, you should never again take any medicine that contains acetaminophen.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
