This device is placed in the uterus where it slowly releases the hormone to prevent pregnancy for 3 years. (Other types of levonorgestrel intrauterine systems release different amounts of hormone and are used for different lengths of time.)</p><p>Skyla can be used whether you have had children or not. It should not be used during pregnancy.</p><p>Levonorgestrel is a progestin hormone and does not contain estrogen. The Skyla IUD releases levonorgestrel in the uterus, but only small amounts of the hormone reach the bloodstream. Skyla should not be used as emergency birth control.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use the Skyla IUD if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding, a pelvic infection, certain other problems with your uterus or cervix, or if you have breast or uterine cancer, liver disease or liver tumor, or a weak immune system.</p><p><b>Do not use Skyla during pregnancy.</b> Call your doctor if you think you might be pregnant.</p><p>Skyla does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have symptoms of a stroke or heart attack, such as sudden numbness or weakness, severe headache, or chest pain.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>An Skyla IUD can increase your risk of developing a serious pelvic infection, which may threaten your life or your future ability to have children. Ask your doctor about your personal risk.</p><p><b>Do not use Skyla during pregnancy.</b> Skyla can cause severe infection, miscarriage, premature birth, or death of the mother if left in place during pregnancy. <b>Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant.</b> If you continue a pregnancy that occurs while using Skyla, watch for signs such as fever, chills, cramps, vaginal bleeding or discharge.</p><p>You should not use Skyla if you are allergic to levonorgestrel, silicone, silica, silver, barium, iron oxide, or polyethylene, or if you have:</p><ul>

The device is usually inserted within 7 days after the start of a menstrual period.</p><p>You may feel pain or dizziness during insertion of the IUD. You may also have minor vaginal bleeding. Tell your doctor if you still have these symptoms longer than 30 minutes.</p><p>The Skyla IUD should not interfere with sexual intercourse, wearing tampons, or using other vaginal medications.</p><p>Your doctor will need to see you within a few weeks after insertion of the device to make sure it is still in place correctly. You will also need regular annual pelvic exams and Pap smears.</p><p>You may have irregular periods during the first 3 to 6 months of use. Your flow may be lighter or heavier, and you may eventually stop having periods after several months. Tell your doctor if you do not have a period for 6 weeks or if you think you might be pregnant.</p><p>The Skyla IUD may come out by itself. After each menstrual period, make sure you can still feel the removal strings. Wash your hands with soap and water, and insert your clean fingers into the vagina. You should be able to feel the strings at the opening of your cervix.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you cannot feel the strings, or if you think the Skyla IUD has slipped lower or has come out of your uterus, especially if you also have pain or bleeding. Use a non-hormone method of birth control (condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, or contraceptive sponge) to prevent pregnancy until your doctor is able to replace the IUD.</p><p>If you need to have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), tell your caregivers ahead of time that you have an IUD in place.</p><p>Your device may be removed at any time you decide to stop using birth control. Skyla IUD's must be removed after 3 years. Your doctor can insert a new device at that time if you wish to continue using this form of birth control. <b>Only your doctor should remove the IUD. Do not attempt to remove the device yourself.</b></p><p>If you wish to continue preventing pregnancy, you may need to start using another birth control method a week before your Skyla is removed.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Contraception:</b></p><p>Intrauterine Device (IUD) insertion should be performed by a trained healthcare provider thoroughly familiar with product; product manufacturer labeling should be consulted:<br/>
<br/>
Insert 1 Skyla IUD (13.5mg) into uterus<br/>
<br/>
Timing of insertion:<br/>
-For women who are not currently using hormonal or intrauterine contraception: Insertion may occur at any time the woman is not pregnant; if inserted after the first 7 days of menstrual cycle, an additional method of contraception should be used for 7 days after insertion<br/>
-Switching from an oral, transdermal, or vaginal hormonal contraceptive: Insertion may occur at any time; if inserted during the hormone phase, continue use for 7 days after insertion or until the end of the current treatment cycle<br/>
-Switching from an injectable progestin contraceptive: Insertion may occur at any time; if inserted more than 3 months after the last injection, an additional method of contraception should be used for 7 days after insertion<br/>
-Switching from a contraceptive implant or another IUD: Insertion should occur on the same day the implant or IUD is removed<br/>
-Inserting after abortion or miscarriage:<br/>
--First trimester: May insert IUD immediately after a first trimester abortion or miscarriage<br/>
--Second trimester: Insertion of IUD should be delayed a minimum of 4 weeks or until the uterus is fully involuted; if involution is delayed, insertion should be delayed until involution is complete; consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to insertion and advise patient on need for an additional method of contraception for 7 days after insertion<br/>
-After childbirth: Insertion of IUD should be delayed a minimum of 4 weeks after delivery, or until the uterus is fully involuted; if involution is delayed, insertion should be delayed until involution is complete; consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to insertion and advise patient on need for an additional method of contraception for 7 days after insertion<br/>
<br/>
Replacement: A Skyla IUD should be replaced after 3 years. A new IUD may be inserted for continued use<br/>
<br/>
Comments: The Skyla IUD may be removed at any time but must be removed by the end of the prescribed time; if continued use is desired, replace with a new IUD.<br/>
<br/>
Uses: Prevention of pregnancy for up to 3 years.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Skyla continuously releases a low dose of levonorgestrel, missing a dose does not occur when using this form of levonorgestrel.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of levonorgestrel released from the intrauterine system is very unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using Skyla?</h2><p>Avoid having more than one sex partner. The Skyla IUD can increase your risk of developing a serious pelvic infection, which is often caused by sexually transmitted disease. Skyla will not protect you from sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV and AIDS. Using a condom is the only way to help protect yourself from these diseases.</p><p>Call your doctor if your sex partner develops HIV or a sexually transmitted disease, or if you have any change in sexual relationships.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Skyla side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Skyla</b>: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Get emergency medical help if you have severe pain in your lower stomach or side. This could be a <b>sign of a tubal pregnancy</b> (a pregnancy that implants in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus). A tubal pregnancy is a medical emergency.</p><p>The Skyla IUD <b>may become embedded into the wall of the uterus, or may perforate (form a hole) in the uterus.</b> If this occurs, the device may no longer prevent pregnancy, or it may move outside the uterus and cause scarring, infection, or damage to other organs. Your doctor may need to surgically remove the device.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>

Tell your doctor about all your other medicines, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products. Tell your doctor about all your current medicines and any medicine you start or stop using.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="faq">Popular FAQ</h2><p>In the U.S there are two types of intrauterine device (IUD) available: copper IUDs (such as ParaGard) and hormonal IUDs (such as: Mirena, Liletta, Skyla, and Kyleena). The most common side effects reported with IUDs are pain on IUD insertion, cramps, bleeding, and unwanted pregnancy. Continue reading</p><p>No, antibiotics do not affect IUDs such as Kyleena, Mirena, or Skyla. In fact, there are not many contraceptive devices or even contraceptives that are affected by antibiotics, despite popular belief that this is the case. IUDs work directly in the uterine cavity and do not rely on absorption through the stomach, nor metabolism through the liver for their effect and have few interactions.
