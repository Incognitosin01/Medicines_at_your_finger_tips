May also be useful as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of duodenal ulcer.</p><p>IT HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN CONCLUSIVELY WHETHER ANTICHOLINERGIC/ ANTISPASMODIC DRUGS AID IN THE HEALING OF A DUODENAL ULCER, DECREASE THE RATE OF RECURRENCES OR PREVENT COMPLICATIONS.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">RE-PB Hyos Elixir is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. Phenobarbital is contraindicated in patients with acute intermittent porphyria and in those patients in which phenobarbital produces restlessness and/or excitement.</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p>Heat prostration can occur with belladonna alkaloids in high temperatures.</p><p>Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug could be harmful.</p><p>RE-PB Hyos Elixir may produce drowsiness and blurred vision. The patient should be warned about engaging in hazardous work or activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery. Phenobarbital may decrease the effect of anticoagulants, and larger doses of the anticoagulant may be needed for optimal effect. When phenobarbital is discontinued, the dose of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased. Phenobarbital may be habit forming and should not be administered to patients who are susceptible to addiction or to those with a history of physical and/or psychological drug dependence.</p><p>Barbiturates should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">GENERAL:<br/>
Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hepatic or renal disease, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia, and hypertension.</p><p>Belladonna alkaloids may produce a delay in gastric emptying (antral stasis) which would complicate the management of gastric ulcer. Do not rely on the use of the drug in the presence of complication of biliary tract disease. Theoretically, with overdosage, a curare-like action may occur.</p><h3>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY:</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p><h3>PREGNANCY CATEGORY C:</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with RE-PB Hyos Elixir. It is not known whether RE-PB Hyos Elixir can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. RE-PB Hyos Elixir  should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>NURSING MOTHERS:</h3><p>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when RE-PB Hyos Elixir is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions associated with anticholinergics and/or anticonvulsants are: dry mouth; tachycardia; urinary hesitancy and retention; palpitation; blurred vision; prolonged pupil dilation; cycloplegia; increased ocular tension; loss of taste sense; headache; nervousness; drowsiness; weakness; dizziness; insomnia; nausea; vomiting; severe allergic reaction or drug idiosyncrasies, including anaphylaxis, hives and/or other dermal manifestations; decreased sweating; impotence; suppression of lactation; constipation; bloated feeling and musculoskeletal pain.

In patients habituated to barbiturates, abrupt withdrawal may produce delirium or convulsions.</p><p>Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.
