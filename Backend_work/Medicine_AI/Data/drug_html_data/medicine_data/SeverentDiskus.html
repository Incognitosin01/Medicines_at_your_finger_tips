</ul><p>Pharmacologic Class: Salmeterol</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Severent Diskus</h2><p>Salmeterol is used together with other medicines (eg, inhaled corticosteroids) to control the symptoms of asthma and prevent bronchospasm in patients with asthma. When used regularly every day, inhaled salmeterol decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, it will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.</p><p>Salmeterol is also used to treat air flow blockage and prevent the worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is also used to prevent wheezing caused by exercise (exercise-induced bronchospasm or EIB).</p><p>Salmeterol is a long-acting bronchodilator. Bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Severent Diskus</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of salmeterol in children 4 years of age and older. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 4 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of salmeterol in the elderly. However, elderly patients with heart or blood vessel problems may require special caution when receiving salmeterol.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Severent Diskus</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain salmeterol.  It may not be specific to Severent Diskus. Please read with care.</b></p><p>Inhaled salmeterol is used to prevent asthma attacks and to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is not used to relieve an asthma attack that has already started. For relief of an asthma attack that has already started, you should use another medicine. If you do not have another medicine to use for an attack or if you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.</p><p><i>Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using this medicine without first telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance of having breathing problems.</p><p>This medicine comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read the directions carefully before using this medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the Diskus®, ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check regularly how you use the Diskus® to make sure you are using it properly.</p><p><i>In order for this medicine to help prevent asthma or COPD attacks, it must be used every day in regularly spaced doses, as ordered by your doctor</i>.</p><p>To use the <i>Diskus®</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Open the foil pouch containing the Diskus®.</li>
<li>To open the Diskus®, push the thumb grip away from you as far as it will go. You will hear a click and feel a snap. When open, the mouthpiece will appear.</li>
<li>Slide the mouthpiece lever away from you as far as it will go until it clicks. The Diskus® is now ready to use. If you close the Diskus® or push the lever again, you will lose the medicine.</li>
<li>Turn your head away from the Diskus®, and breathe out to the end of a normal breath. Do not breathe into the Diskus®.</li>
<li>Holding the Diskus® level, put the mouthpiece between your lips and teeth, and close your lips around the mouthpiece. Do not bite down on the mouthpiece. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue.</li>
<li>Breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath. Do not breathe through your nose.</li>
<li>Hold your breath and remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Continue holding your breath as long as you can up to 10 seconds before breathing out slowly. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs.</li>
<li>Turn your head away from the Diskus®, and breathe out slowly to the end of a normal breath. Do not breathe into the Diskus®.</li>
<li>If your doctor has told you to inhale more than one puff of medicine at each dose, take the second puff using exactly the same steps you used for the first puff.</li>
<li>When you are finished, close the Diskus®. Place your thumb on the thumb grip, and slide it back toward you as far as it will go. You will hear it click shut.</li>
<li>Keep the Diskus® dry. Do not wash the mouthpiece, or any other part of the Diskus®. You may use a dry cloth to wipe it clean.</li>
<li>The Diskus® has a window that shows the number of doses that are left. This tells you when you are getting low on medicine. When the Diskus® has 5 doses left, the numbers from 5 to 0 will show up in red to remind you to refill your prescription.</li>
