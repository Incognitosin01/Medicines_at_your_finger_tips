Human exposure should, therefore, be minimized by observing the general industry standards for occupational health and safety.</p><p>Precautions such as the following should be considered: dust masks or respirators and protective clothing should be worn; dust arresting equipment and adequate ventilation should be utilized; personal hygiene should be observed; wash before eating or leaving a work site; be alert for signs of allergic reactions—seek prompt medical treatment if such reactions are suspected.</p><h2>STORE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE</h2><p class="First"> </p><h2>Mixing Directions</h2><p class="First">Bloat Guard Type A Medicated Article must be thoroughly and evenly distributed into feedstuffs.

The normal dosage of Bloat Guard (1 g of poloxalene per 100 lb of body weight) is recommended for cattle under moderate bloat-producing conditions. For cattle under severe bloat-producing conditions, the normal dosage should be doubled (2 g of poloxalene per 100 lb of body weight).</p><p>Repeat the feeding of Bloat Guard when animals are exposed to bloat-producing conditions more than 12 hours from the last feeding of Bloat Guard, but do not exceed the double dosage of Bloat Guard in any 24-hour period. Animals should be fed the recommended amounts of Bloat Guard starting 2 or 3 days before they are exposed to bloat-producing conditions.</p><p><span class="Bold">Caution:</span> It is essential that each animal consumes the total recommended dosage of Bloat Guard daily for adequate protection.</p><h2>Warning:</h2><p class="First">The normal life of this product is at least 24 months.
