VP-PNV-DHA is also useful in improving nutritional status prior to conception.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients including fish or fish oil.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where Vitamin B12 is deficient. Since daily ingestion of more than 3 grams per day of omega-3 fatty acids (including alpha linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) from fish oils may have potential antithrombotic activities and may increase bleeding times, administration of DHA should be avoided in patients with inherited or acquired bleeding diatheses, including those taking anticoagulants.</p><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Store at controlled room temperature 20째-25째C (68째-77째F).
