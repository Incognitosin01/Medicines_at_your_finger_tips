An alternative is to overlap the two agents. If this is done, the timing of warfarin initiation is based on CrCl as outlined below:</p><p>CrCl &gt;50 mL/minute: Initiate warfarin 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran.</p><p>CrCl 30 to 50 mL/minute: Initiate warfarin 2 days before discontinuing dabigatran.</p><p>CrCl 15 to 30 mL/minute: Initiate warfarin 1 day before discontinuing dabigatran.</p><p>CrCl &lt;15 mL/minute: Dabigatran should not be used.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Dabigatran can elevate the INR, complicating interpretation if overlapped with warfarin.

Pai, PharmD, FCP; Jason Roberts, PhD, BPharm (Hons), B App Sc, FSHP, FISAC.</p><p><b>Note:</b> There are limited data in patients with obesity demonstrating significant changes in dabigatran etexilate drug concentrations (Coons 2020; Covert 2020; Kido 2020; Piran 2018; Rocca 2018; Sebaaly 2020). The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) 2016 guideline suggests avoiding the use of dabigatran etexilate in patients with a BMI &gt;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or weight &gt;120 kg due to the lack of clinical data in this population. If used in a patient with a BMI &gt;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or weight &gt;120 kg, ISTH suggests measuring peak and trough coagulation assays using ecarin clotting time or dilute thrombin time with appropriate calibration, or serum levels via mass spectrometry. These coagulation tests may not be readily available at all institutions. Also, there is a lack of data to support dabigatran etexilate dose adjustments based on drug levels. Alternatively, other anticoagulants (eg, other direct oral anticoagulants [DOACs] where data support use or vitamin K antagonists) may be considered in this patient population (ISTH [Martin 2016]; expert opinion).</p><p>For bariatric and other GI surgery patients, evaluate the risk versus benefit of possible decreased drug absorption. Dabigatran capsules are designed to release in the stomach, which is dependent on an acidic environment. Absorption primarily occurs in the proximal small intestine. Surgeries that increase the pH (more alkaline) of the stomach (eg, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) or decrease small intestine sites may decrease absorption of dabigatran (Hakeam 2017). The available data are conflicting for absorption alterations, derived from small populations, and underrepresent individual DOACs and distinct surgeries (Kröll 2017; Kröll 2018; Lee 2013; Rottenstreich 2018). Since there is no established correlation between target blood levels of DOACs with efficacy, therapeutic drug monitoring is difficult. Consider alternative anticoagulation if there is a need for direct monitoring (Hakeam 2017).</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Oral: Administer with a full glass of water without regard to meals; however, if dyspepsia occurs, consider administration with meals. Do not break, chew, or open capsules, as this will lead to 75% increase in absorption and potentially serious adverse reactions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Blister: Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).

These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include use of indwelling epidural catheters; concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, or other anticoagulants; a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures; a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery; optimal timing between the administration of dabigatran and neuraxial procedures is not known.</p><p>Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary.</p><p>Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Bleeding: The most common complication is bleeding, including severe and potentially fatal bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include concurrent use of drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (eg, antiplatelet agents, heparin), renal impairment, and elderly patients (especially if low body weight). Discontinue in patients with active pathological bleeding. <b>Important:</b> Idarucizumab is commercially available and is the most effective agent for dabigatran reversal. Protamine and vitamin K do not reverse or impact anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. Dabigatran is dialyzable (~57% removed over 4 hours); however, supporting data are limited for utilizing this method. Depending on the bleeding severity, activated oral charcoal should be considered if ingestion occurred within 1 to 2 hours of presentation. The following alternative options may also be considered depending on specific clinical scenario: 4-factor unactivated prothrombin concentrate (PCC) (eg, Kcentra) or 4-factor activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) (eg, FEIBA). Some studies and case reports have shown moderate success in correcting coagulation tests with some of these agents; however, correction of coagulation tests does not imply reversal of the anticoagulation effect of the medication (AHA/ASA [Hemphill 2015; EHRA [Heidbuchel 2015]; NCS/SCCM [Frontera 2016]). Platelet concentrates should be considered when thrombocytopenia is present or long-acting antiplatelet drugs have been used.</p><p>• Thromboembolic events: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Upon premature discontinuation, the risk of thrombotic events is increased. If dabigatran must be discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider the use of another anticoagulant during the time of interruption.</b> In patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who had an acute ischemic stroke while receiving a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) (eg, dabigatran), guidelines generally support withholding oral anticoagulation until 1 to 2 weeks after the ischemic stroke (time frame may vary with shorter times for transient ischemic attack or small, non-disabling stroke and longer times for moderate to severe stroke) (AHA [Raval 2017]; AHA/ASA [Kernan 2014]; EHRA [Heidbuchel 2015]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Antiphospholipid syndrome: Use is not recommended for patients with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome; safety and efficacy have not been established. Patients positive for all three antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I) may have increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.</p><p>• GI/Bariatric surgery: Altered absorption: Evaluate the risk versus benefit of possible decreased drug absorption. Dabigatran capsules are designed to release in the stomach, which is dependent on an acidic environment. Absorption primarily occurs in the proximal small intestine. Surgeries that increase the pH (more alkaline) of the stomach (eg, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) or decrease small intestine sites may decrease absorption of dabigatran (Hakeam 2017).</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) demonstrated large inter-subject variability; however, no consistent change in exposure or pharmacodynamics was seen. Patients with active liver disease were excluded from the Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) trial (Connolly 2009).</p><p>• Renal impairment: Evaluate renal function prior to and during therapy, particularly if used in patients with any degree of preexisting renal impairment or in any condition that may result in a decline in renal function (eg, hypovolemia, dehydration, concomitant use of medications with a potential to affect renal function); dabigatran concentrations may increase in any degree of renal impairment and increase the risk of bleeding. In moderate impairment, serum concentrations may increase 3 times higher than normal compared to concentrations in patients with normal renal function. However, in patients with nonvalvular AF, US labeling only requires dosage reduction in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to 30 mL/minute) and dosing recommendations cannot be provided in patients with CrCl &lt;15 mL/minute. May consider dose reduction in patients with nonvalvular AF and moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; CrCl 15 to 30 mL/minute); dabigatran is not recommended for patients with AF and end-stage CKD or on hemodialysis (AHA/ACC/HRS [January 2014]). Dabigatran is considered contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤30 mL/minute) (ACCP [Guyatt 2012]). Discontinue therapy in any patient who develops acute renal failure.</p><p>• Valvular heart disease: Use is not recommended in patients with valvular heart disease, including the presence of a bioprosthetic heart valve; use is contraindicated in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves. In addition to several case reports, one clinical trial reported significantly more thromboembolic events and an excess of major bleeding in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves receiving dabigatran compared to those receiving adjusted-dose warfarin (Chu 2012; Price 2012; Stewart 2012). Avoid use of DOACs in patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis (AHA/ACC/HRS [January 2019]). However, a DOAC may be used in patients with AF and native aortic valve disease, tricuspid valve disease, or mitral regurgitation when anticoagulation is required (AHA/ACC/HRS [January 2014, 2019]; AHA/ACC [Nishimura 2017]).</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues: </i></b></p><p>• Antithrombotic agents: Due to an increased risk of bleeding, avoid use, if possible, with other direct thrombin inhibitors (eg, bivalirudin), unfractionated heparin or heparin derivatives, low molecular weight heparins (eg, enoxaparin), fondaparinux, thienopyridines (eg, clopidogrel), GPIIb/IIIa antagonists (eg, eptifibatide), aspirin, coumarin derivatives, sulfinpyrazone, and ticagrelor. NSAIDs should be used cautiously. Appropriate doses of unfractionated heparin may be used to maintain catheter patency.</p><p>• Drug/drug interactions: Potentially significant interactions may exist, requiring dose or frequency adjustment, additional monitoring, and/or selection of alternative therapy. Consult Drug Interactions database for more detailed information.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Elderly: <b>Use with extreme caution or consider other treatment options.</b> No dosage adjustment is recommended in the manufacturer's labeling based on age alone (unless renal impairment coexists); however, risk of bleeding increases with age. Numerous reports of excess anticoagulation, including fatalities, have been observed with use in older adults (ISMP [Smetzer 2012]; ISMP [Smetzer 2015]). In particular, an increased risk of GI bleeding has been observed in patients ≥75 years of age despite similar efficacy observed with dabigatran in the elderly as compared to warfarin-treated patients (Graham 2015; Sharma 2015). Dabigatran is associated with more than a 5-fold variation in plasma concentrations in patients receiving the same dose, indicating a wide therapeutic range. Significant factors affecting increased dabigatran plasma concentrations have been found to be increasing age, decreased CrCl, lower body weight and female gender. Renal function was the predominant patient characteristic determining plasma concentrations, with age as the most important covariate (Reilly 2014). Depending on individual patient characteristics, particularly advanced age and potential for renal impairment, consider other treatment options (Kalabalik 2015).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Surgical patients: When temporary interruption is necessary before surgery, the timing of discontinuation depends on renal function and risk for bleeding complications. In patients with CrCl ≥50 mL/minute, discontinue therapy ~24 to 48 hours before surgery depending on risk for bleeding. In patients with CrCl &lt;50 mL/minute, discontinue therapy ~72 to 120 hours before surgery depending on risk for bleeding. Consider discontinuing for a longer period of time in patients undergoing major surgery, spinal puncture, or insertion of a spinal or epidural catheter or port. When there is adequate hemostasis after surgery, may reinstitute therapy after 24 hours if there is low risk for bleeding or after 48 to 72 hours if there is high risk for bleeding. Other specific considerations can be found in expert scientific statements and consensus pathways (AHA [Raval 2017]; ACC [Doherty 2017]).</p><p>• Spinal or epidural hematoma: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Spinal or epidural hematomas may occur with neuraxial anesthesia (epidural or spinal anesthesia) or spinal puncture in patients who are anticoagulated; may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of spinal/epidural hematoma is increased with the use of indwelling epidural catheters, concomitant administration of other drugs that affect hemostasis (eg, NSAIDs, platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants), in patients with a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures, or a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is low; however, the optimal timing between the administration of dabigatran and neuraxial procedures is not known. Monitor frequently for signs and symptoms of neurologic impairment (eg, midline back pain, numbness/weakness of legs, bowel/bladder dysfunction); prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary. In patients who are anticoagulated or pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis is anticipated, assess risks versus benefits prior to neuraxial interventions.</b></p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC, aPTT, PT, serum creatinine, and liver function tests prior to initiation, when clinically indicated, and at least annually (AHA/ACC/HRS [January 2014, 2019]; Leung 2019); signs of bleeding.</p><p>Routine coagulation testing is <b>not</b> required or necessary for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). There are currently no FDA-approved assays or calibration reagents available.</p><p>In clinical situations when assessment of the anticoagulant effect is useful (eg, acute care, periprocedural settings, absorption), evaluating a recent creatinine clearance and time since the last dose was ingested is usually sufficient for guiding clinical decisions. The following coagulation testing may also be helpful in quantitative assessments to exclude clinically relevant dabigatran levels: Dilute thrombin time, ecarin clotting time, or ecarin chromogenic assays (ACC [Tomaselli 2020]; AHA [Raval 2017]; Leung 2019).</p><p>If a sensitive reagent is used, normal partial thromboplastin time usually excludes clinically relevant serum concentrations although a therapeutic range has not been established for quantification. Thrombin time is highly sensitive and a normal value excludes clinically relevant levels (ACC [Tomaselli 2020]; AHA [Raval 2017]).</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Information related to the use of direct acting oral anticoagulants in pregnancy is limited; until safety data are available, adequate contraception is recommended during therapy for females of childbearing potential. Females planning a pregnancy should be switched to alternative anticoagulants prior to conception (Cohen 2016).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>An ex vivo human placenta dual perfusion model illustrated that dabigatran crossed the placenta at term; dabigatran etexilate mesylate (prodrug) had limited placental transfer (Bapat 2014). Use of direct acting oral anticoagulants increases the risk of bleeding in all patients. When used in pregnancy, there is also the potential for fetal bleeding or subclinical placental bleeding which may increase the risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, fetal compromise, or stillbirth (Cohen 2016).</p><p>Information related to the use of dabigatran etexilate in pregnancy is limited (Beyer-Westendorf 2016; Lameijer 2018). Data are insufficient to evaluate the safety of direct acting oral anticoagulants during pregnancy (Guyatt 2012) and use in pregnant females is not recommended (Regitz-Zagrosek [ESC 2018]). Agents other than dabigatran etexilate are preferred for the treatment of AF or VTE in pregnant patients (Kearon 2016; Lip 2018; Regitz-Zagrosek [ESC 2018]). Patients should be switched to an alternative anticoagulant if pregnancy occurs during therapy. Fetal monitoring that includes evaluations for fetal bleeding and assessments for risk of preterm delivery are recommended if the direct acting oral anticoagulant is continued (Cohen 2016).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to thin the blood so that clots will not form.</p><p>• It is used to treat blood clots.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
