It is also used to treat psoriatic arthritis, which is a type of arthritis that causes pain and swelling in the joints along with patches of scaly skin on some areas of the body. Golimumab is also used to treat ankylosing spondylitis (arthritis in the spine or backbone) and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.</p><p>Golimumab injection is used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in patients who have been treated with other medicines that did not work well.</p><p>Golimumab is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using golimumab</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For golimumab, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to golimumab or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Simponi®</i> in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>Simponi Aria®</i> in children 2 years of age and older with <i>polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis</i> and <i>psoriatic arthritis</i>. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children with other conditions.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of golimumab injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have serious infections, which may require caution in patients receiving golimumab injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking golimumab, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using golimumab with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of golimumab</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you <i>Simponi Aria®</i> (together with methotrexate) in a hospital. Golimumab is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. It must be injected slowly, so your IV tube will need to stay in place for 30 minutes.</p><p>Golimumab comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p><i>Simponi®</i> is given as a shot under your skin. It may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in a hospital or clinic. If you are using golimumab at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you how to prepare and inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand exactly how to use the medicine.</p><p>If you use <i>Simponi®</i> at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems.</p><p><i>Simponi®</i> is available in 2 forms. You may use a <i>prefilled syringe</i> or a prefilled <i>SmartJect® autoinjector</i>.</p><p>The needle covers of the prefilled syringe and SmartJect® autoinjector contain dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex). This may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you have a latex allergy before you start using golimumab.</p><p>To use <i>Simponi® injection</i>:</p><ul>
<li>First, gather the items you will need on a clean, flat surface using a cloth or towel in a well-lighted area.</li>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using golimumab.</li>
<li>Remove the carton with the syringe or autoinjector from the refrigerator and place it on the clean cloth.</li>
<li>Allow 30 minutes for the syringe to warm up to room temperature. Do not warm golimumab in any other way.</li>
<li>Do not remove the needle cover from the prefilled syringe or the autoinjector cap while allowing the medicine to reach room temperature. Remove these immediately before use.</li>
<li>Check the liquid in the syringe or autoinjector using the viewing window. It should be clear and colorless or slightly yellow in color. The liquid may have small white particles or an air bubble. If it is cloudy, discolored, or contains large particles, do not use the syringe or autoinjector.</li>
<li>If the liquid is clear, place it on the clean, flat surface. Do not shake the medicine.</li>
<li>Choose an injection site on your body (eg, middle thigh, lower abdomen or stomach area, or upper arm). Clean the injection site with a fresh alcohol wipe, and let it dry.</li>
<li>Remove the cap or needle cover when you are ready to inject. Inject the medicine within 5 minutes after the cap or cover has been removed.</li>
<li>For the SmartJect® autoinjector:
<ul>
<li>Hold the autoinjector in your hand.</li>
<li>Push the open end of the autoinjector firmly against your skin at a 90-degree angle.</li>
<li>Use your free hand to pinch and hold the skin at the injection site.</li>
<li>Press the button with your fingers or thumb to inject the medicine.</li>
<li>Do not pull the autoinjector away from the skin until you hear 2 loud "click" sounds. It usually takes up to 15 seconds for you to hear the second "click" sound. This means that the injection is finished and the needle has pulled back into the autoinjector.</li>
<li>Lift the autoinjector from the injector site. Check the viewing window on the autoinjector for a yellow indicator. The yellow indicator means the autoinjector worked properly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the prefilled syringe:
<ul>
<li>Hold the syringe with one hand between the thumb and index fingers.</li>
<li>Use your free hand to pinch and hold the skin at the injection site.</li>
<li>Inject the medicine in a dart-like motion into the pinched skin at a 45-degree angle.</li>
<li>Use your thumb to push the plunger and inject the full dose of the medicine. Pull the needle out of the skin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do not inject into skin areas that are red, bruised, tender, or hard, or have scars or stretch marks.</li>
<li>You might have a small amount of blood or liquid at the injection site. Press and hold a dry, clean cotton ball on the injection site for 10 seconds, but do not rub it.</li>

You may also store the medicine in the original carton at room temperature for 30 days, as needed. Do not put it back in the refrigerator once you have stored it at room temperature, and throw it away after 30 days.</p><p>Throw away used syringes or autoinjectors in a hard, closed container where the needles cannot poke through. Keep this container away from children and pets.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using golimumab</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that golimumab is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Golimumab may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after you receive golimumab.</p><p>You will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start using golimumab. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.</p><p>Golimumab can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor right away if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor right away if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>Do not have any live vaccines (immunizations) while you are being treated with golimumab. Check with your doctor before having any vaccines. Tell your doctor if you have a baby and you have received golimumab while you are pregnant. Tell your child's doctor before your child receives a vaccine. Golimumab may increase the risk for infections in children for up to 6 months after birth.</p><p>Do not take other medicines for arthritis unless you talk to your doctor. This includes abatacept (Orencia®), anakinra (Kineret®), adalimumab (Humira®), certolizumab (Cimzia®), etanercept (Enbrel®), infliximab (Remicade®), rituximab (Rituxan®), or tocilizumab (Actemra®). <i>Using any of these together with golimumab may increase your chance of having serious side effects</i>.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have more than one of these symptoms: chest pain, decreased urine output, dilated neck veins, extreme fatigue, irregular breathing, irregular heartbeat, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, tightness in the chest, trouble breathing, or weight gain. These may be signs of a heart condition called congestive heart failure (CHF).</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have more than one of these symptoms: blurred vision, difficulty controlling your bladder or bowels, difficulty with walking, feeling sad or depressed, forgetfulness, muscle cramps, numbness or tingling in your arms, legs, or face, slurred speech or problems with swallowing, or unusual tiredness or weakness. These may be signs of a nervous system disease called multiple sclerosis (MS).</p><p>Golimumab may increase your risk of getting certain types of cancer, including lymphoma, leukemia, skin cancer, and colon cancer. Some teenagers and young adults with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL). Check with your doctor right away if you have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, or unexplained weight loss.</p><p>Golimumab may increase your risk of having a lupus-like syndrome. Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain, fever or chills, a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or weakness, joint pain, a rash on the cheeks or arms that is worse in the sun, or severe tiredness.</p><p>Golimumab may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Wear sunscreen. Do not use sunlamps or tanning beds.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Golimumab side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
