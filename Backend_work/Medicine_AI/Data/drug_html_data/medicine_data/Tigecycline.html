Use effective birth control, and tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant during treatment.</p><p>Tigecycline can make birth control pills less effective. Ask your doctor about using non hormonal birth control (condom, diaphragm with spermicide) to prevent pregnancy while using tigecycline.</p><p>It is not known whether tigecycline passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><p>Children should not use tigecycline.

Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Tigecycline is injected into a vein through an IV. You may be shown how to use an IV at home. Do not give yourself this medicine if you do not understand how to use the injection and properly dispose of needles, IV tubing, and other items used.</p><p>Tigecycline is usually given once every 12 hours. Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully. The medicine must be given slowly, and each IV infusion can take 30 to 60 minutes to complete.</p><p>Tigecycline is a powder medicine that must be mixed with a liquid (diluent) in an IV bag before using it. If you are using the injections at home, be sure you understand how to properly mix and store the medication.</p><p>Prepare your dose only when you are ready to give an injection. After mixing, the liquid should appear as a yellow or orange color. Do not use if the medicine has changed to green or black, or if it has any particles in it.
