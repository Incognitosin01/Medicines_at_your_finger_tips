A meta-analysis supports the use of ferric gluconate in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not on dialysis; randomized controlled trials of oral versus intravenous iron in patients with CKD (dialysis and nondialysis dependent) were analyzed and found that patients receiving IV iron products were more likely to reach desired hemoglobin levels with an associated slightly higher risk of hypotension and fewer gastrointestinal side effects <sup>[Shepshelovich 2016]</sup>. Data from two randomized, multicenter trials support the use of ferric gluconate in the management of chemotherapy-associated anemia in patients with cancer <sup>[Henry 2007]</sup>, <sup>[Pedrazzoli 2008]</sup>. IV ferric gluconate may be of benefit in patients whose absorption of oral iron may be impaired (eg, inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]) or in patients in whom IV iron therapy may provide more expeditious improvement in hematologic parameters <sup>[Gomollón 2013]</sup>, <sup>[Reed 2015]</sup>.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to ferric gluconate or any component of the formulation.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Anemias not associated with iron deficiency and where there is evidence of iron overload (eg, hemochromatosis, chronic hemolysis) or iron utilization disorders (eg, sideroblastic anemia, lead anemia); serious hypersensitivity to other parenteral iron products; severe inflammatory diseases of the liver or kidneys.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note: </b>A test dose of 2 mL diluted in NS 50 mL administered over 60 minutes was previously recommended (not in current manufacturer labeling [consider a test dose in patients with a history of drug allergies]).</p><p><b>Iron-deficiency anemia, hemodialysis patients:</b> IV: 125 mg (elemental iron) per dialysis session.

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Adverse events were not observed in animal reproduction studies.</p><p>Maternal iron requirements increase during pregnancy. Adequate iron concentrations to the fetus can be maintained regardless of maternal iron status, except in severe cases of anemia (IOM 2001). Untreated iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in a pregnant female may be associated with adverse events, including low birth weight, preterm birth, or increased perinatal mortality (ACOG 95 2008; BSH [Pavord 2020]; IOM 2001).</p><p>In general, treatment of iron deficiency or IDA in pregnancy is the same as in nonpregnant females (USPSTF [Siu 2015]). The majority of studies note iron therapy improves maternal hematologic parameters; however, information related to clinical outcomes in the mother and neonate is limited (FIGO 2019; USPSTF [Siu 2015]).</p><p>Oral preparations are generally sufficient; however, parenteral iron therapy may be used in females who cannot tolerate or will not take oral iron, in cases of severe iron deficiency, or when malabsorption is present (ACOG 95 2008; BSH [Pavord 2020). Due to limited safety data in early pregnancy, use of IV iron is generally not started until the second or third trimester (BSH [Pavord 2020]; FIGO 2019). Information related to the use of ferric gluconate in pregnancy is limited (Breymann 2017). Fetal monitoring is recommended during maternal IV ferric gluconate administration due to risk of severe adverse reactions (eg, hypotension, anaphylaxis) that may be harmful to fetus, especially during the second and third trimester.</p><p>Preparations may contain benzyl alcohol (avoid in pregnant women due to association with gasping syndrome in premature infants).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat anemia.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
