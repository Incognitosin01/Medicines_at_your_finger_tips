<html><head></head><body><h1>OTN Mitoxantrone</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> mitoxantrone (mye-toe-ZAN-trone)</p><p>MitoXANTRONE should be given slowly into a freely flowing IV infusion and must never be given subQ, IM, or intra-arterially. Not for intrathecal use; severe injury with permanent sequelae can result from intrathecal administration. Except for the treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, therapy generally should not be given to patients with baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1500 cells/mm(3). Cardiotoxicity, potentially fatal, has been associated with treatment. Presence or history of cardiovascular disease, prior or concomitant radiotherapy to the mediastinal/pericardial area, previous therapy with other anthracyclines or anthracenediones, or concomitant use of other cardiotoxic drugs may increase the risk of cardiac toxicity. Monitor cardiac function (cardiac signs/symptoms and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)) in all patients during therapy. Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have a baseline LVEF below the lower limit of normal should not receive mitoXANTRONE. Monitor MS patients for cardiac function prior to each dose. Do not give additional doses if clinically significant drop in LVEF during treatment and do not administer a cumulative dose greater than 140 mg/m(2) in MS patients. When mitoXANTRONE therapy is withdrawn, late-occurring cardiotoxicity should be evaluated on an annual basis in MS patients. MitoXANTRONE therapy in MS patients and in cancer patients increases the risk of developing secondary acute myeloid leukemia .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

It belongs to the group of medicines known as antineoplastics or cancer medicines. Mitoxantrone is also used to treat some forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). This medicine will not cure MS, but it may extend the time between relapses.</p><p>Mitoxantrone interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by mitoxantrone, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some unwanted effects may not occur for months or years after the medicine is used.</p><p>Before you begin treatment with mitoxantrone, you and your doctor should talk about the good this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.</p><p>This medicine is to be administered only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using OTN Mitoxantrone</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of OTN Mitoxantrone</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain mitoxantrone.  It may not be specific to OTN Mitoxantrone. Please read with care.</b></p><p>Mitoxantrone is sometimes given together with certain other medicines. If you are using a combination of medicines, it is important that you receive each one at the proper time. If you are taking some of these medicines by mouth, ask your doctor to help you plan a way to take them at the right times.</p><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital or cancer clinic. This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins.</p><p>If you have pain, burning, redness, or swelling of your skin area where the needle is placed, tell your doctor or nurse right away.</p><p>If this medicine gets on your skin, rinse the area well with warm water and tell your doctor. If the medicine gets in your eyes, rinse your eyes with large amounts of water, and tell your doctor.</p><p>While you are receiving mitoxantrone, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids so you will pass more urine. This will help prevent kidney problems and keep your kidneys working well.</p><p>Mitoxantrone often causes nausea and vomiting. However, it is very important that you continue to receive the medicine, even if your stomach is upset. Ask your doctor for ways to lessen these effects.</p><p>This medicine comes with a patient package insert. Read and follow the information carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using OTN Mitoxantrone</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests and tests for your heart function may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>You should not receive this medicine if you are pregnant. Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away. Also, your doctor may require you to have a pregnancy test before you receive each dose of this medicine, to make sure you are not pregnant.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you are having chest pain or discomfort; fast or irregular heartbeats; shortness of breath; swelling of the feet and lower legs; or troubled breathing. These could be symptoms of a serious heart problem.</p><p>This medicine may change the color of your urine to a bluish-green color. The whites of your eyes may also appear slightly bluish-green. This is normal, especially within the first 24 hours after you receive the medicine.</p><p>While you are being treated with mitoxantrone, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Mitoxantrone may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not receive live virus vaccines (eg, nasal flu vaccine, measles, mumps, or rubella) since there is a chance they could pass the virus to you. Also, avoid persons who have received live virus vaccines. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.</p><p>Mitoxantrone can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; blood in the urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">OTN Mitoxantrone side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
