It flowers in April and derives its name from the bright yellow color of the rhizome.Duke 2002, USDA 2016 A synonym is Zanthorhiza apiifolia.</p><h2>History</h2><p>One of the primary uses of yellow root by American Indians was as a natural source of yellow dye. Among other uses, yellow root has been used as a remedy for hypertension and diabetes, for mouth infections and sore throat, and to aid in childbirth.Duke 2002, Newall 1996</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Berberine is the major alkaloid in yellow root, with the minor alkaloids jatrorhizine, mognoflorine, and puntarenine identified; the isoquinoline alkaloids liriodenine and palmatine have also been isolated. The berberine content in yellow root is estimated to range from 1.2% to 1.3%.Knapp 1967, Okunade 1994, Wu 1989</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>Yellow root may exhibit properties similar to those of goldenseal and barberry because of the presence of berberine; however, limited experiments have been reported with X. simplicissima. See the Goldenseal and Barberry monographs.</p><h3>In vitro and animal data</h3><p>Antimicrobial activity has been described,Okunade 1994 and in vitro inhibition of leukemia cell replication has been demonstrated.Baker 1989</p><h3>Clinical data</h3><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of yellow root for any condition.</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>There is no clinical evidence to support dosing recommendations for yellow root. Doses of 0.5 to 1 tsp of the powdered root bark taken up to 3 times a day have been documented.Duke 2002 Yellow root may be used as an adulterant in goldenseal preparations.</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use during pregnancy.Kumar 2015 The chemical constituent berberine crosses the placenta, is transferred through breast milk, and has been associated with jaundice and kernicterus in neonates.Kumar 2015</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Information is lacking; however, clinical trials using berberine report minor GI adverse effects.Kumar 2015</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>A case report of toxicity after drinking yellow root tea for 2 years has been attributed to arsenic contamination.Parsons 1981 Information on X. simplicissima whole plant extract is lacking. Berberine is a naturally occurring active constituent in the root, rhizome, and stem bark of many medicinally important plants, with no genotoxic, cytotoxic, or mutagenic effects reported with clinical doses.Kumar 2015</p><h2>Index Terms</h2><ul><li><i>Zanthorhiza apiifolia</i></li></ul><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
