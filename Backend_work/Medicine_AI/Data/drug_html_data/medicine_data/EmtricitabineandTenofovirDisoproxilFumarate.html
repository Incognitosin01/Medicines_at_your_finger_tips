Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in individuals who are infected with HBV and discontinue emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. If appropriate, initiation of antihepatitis B therapy may be warranted.</p><p>Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate used for HIV-1 preexposure prophylaxis must only be prescribed to individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative immediately prior to initiating and at least every 3 months during use. Drug-resistant HIV-1 variants have been identified with use of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV-1 preexposure prophylaxis following undetected acute HIV-1 infection. Do not initiate emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV-1 preexposure prophylaxis if signs or symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection are present unless negative infection status is confirmed.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Decreased bone mineral density: In clinical trials, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has been associated with decreases in bone mineral density in HIV-1 infected adults and increases in bone metabolism markers. Serum parathyroid hormone and 1,25 vitamin D levels were also higher. Decreases in bone mineral density have also been observed in clinical trials of HIV-1 infected pediatric patients. Observations in chronic hepatitis B infected pediatric patients (aged 12-18 years) were similar. In all pediatric clinical trials, skeletal growth (height) appears unaffected. Consider monitoring of bone density in adult and pediatric patients with a history of pathologic fractures or with other risk factors for bone loss or osteoporosis. Consider calcium and vitamin D supplementation for all patients; effect of supplementation has not been studied but may be beneficial. Long-term bone health and fracture risk unknown. If abnormalities are suspected, expert assessment is recommended.</p><p>• Immune reconstitution syndrome: Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome resulting in the occurrence of an inflammatory response to an indolent or residual opportunistic infection during initial HIV treatment or activation of autoimmune disorders (eg, Graves’ disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis) later in therapy; further evaluation and treatment may be required.</p><p>• Lactic acidosis/hepatomegaly: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported with use of nucleoside analogues, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Suspend treatment in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (marked transaminase elevation may/may not accompany hepatomegaly and steatosis).</p><p>• Osteomalacia and renal dysfunction: May cause osteomalacia with proximal renal tubulopathy. Bone pain, extremity pain, fractures, arthralgias, weakness and muscle pain have been reported. In patients at risk for renal dysfunction, persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms should be evaluated for hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia.</p><p>• Renal toxicity: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may cause renal toxicity (acute renal failure and/or Fanconi syndrome); avoid use with concurrent or recent nephrotoxic therapy (including high dose or multiple NSAID use). Acute renal failure has occurred in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal impairment who were on a stable tenofovir regimen to which a high dose or multiple NSAID therapy was added. Consider alternatives to NSAIDS in patients taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and at risk for renal impairment. Calculate creatinine clearance and assess serum creatinine, urine glucose, and urine protein prior to initiation of therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorous. IDSA guidelines recommend discontinuing tenofovir (and substituting with alternative antiretroviral therapy) in HIV-infected patients who develop a decline in GFR (a &gt;25% decrease in GFR from baseline and to a level of &lt;60 mL/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) during use, particularly in presence of proximal tubular dysfunction (eg, euglycemic glycosuria, increased urinary phosphorus excretion and hypophosphatemia, proteinuria [new onset or worsening]) (IDSA [Lucas 2014]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Chronic hepatitis B: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Acute, severe exacerbations of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been reported in HBV-infected individuals who have discontinued emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Closely monitor hepatic function with clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in individuals infected with HBV who discontinue this therapy. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted,</b> especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis. All individuals with HIV should be tested for HBV prior to initiation of treatment; HBV-uninfected patients should be offered vaccination.</p><p>• Comprehensive prevention program: Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should be accompanied by a comprehensive HIV-1 prevention program (eg, risk reduction counseling, access to condoms), with particular emphasis on medication adherence. In addition, regular monitoring (eg, HIV status of patient and partner(s), risk behavior, adherence, adverse effects, sexually transmitted infections that facilitate HIV-1 transmission) is highly recommended. Time from initiation of therapy to maximal protection against HIV-1 is unknown.</p><p>• HIV treatment and renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment (CrCl &lt;50 mL/minute); dosage adjustment required. Do not use in patients with CrCl &lt;30 mL/minute or requiring hemodialysis. IDSA guidelines recommend avoiding tenofovir in HIV patients with preexisting kidney disease (CrCl &lt;50 mL/minute and not on hemodialysis or GFR &lt;60 mL/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) when other effective HIV treatment options exist because data suggest risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increased (IDSA [Lucas 2014]).</p><p>• PrEP and renal impairment: Do not use in CrCl &lt;60 mL/minute.</p><p>• Resistance risk with PrEP: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Confirm HIV-1 negative status immediately before and at least every 3 months during therapy.</b> <b>Do not start PrEP if signs or symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection are present unless HIV-1 negative status is confirmed</b> by a test approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an aid to detect HIV-1 infection (including acute or primary infection). <b>Risk of drug resistant HIV-1 variants with PrEP use if patient had undetected acute HIV-1 infection.</b> Some HIV-1 tests (eg, rapid tests) do not detect acute HIV-1 infection. Screen PrEP candidates for acute viral infections and potential exposure events (eg, condomless sex/condom breaking during sex with a partner of unknown HIV-1 status or unknown viremic status, or a recent STI) within 1 month of starting PrEP. If infections or events exist, reconfirm HIV-1 negative status. If a screening test indicates possible HIV-1 infection or if symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection develop after a potential exposure, convert the HIV-1 PrEP regimen to an HIV-1 treatment regimen until negative infection status is confirmed.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Duplicate therapy: Do not use concurrently with emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, tenofovir alafenamide, or any combination of these drugs.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential, reticulocyte count, creatine kinase, CD4 count, HIV RNA plasma levels, serum phosphorus (individuals with chronic kidney disease); serum creatinine, urine glucose and urine protein (prior to initiation and as clinically indicated during therapy), hepatic function tests, bone density (patients with a history of bone fracture or have risk factors for bone loss); testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV) is recommended prior to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy; weight (children).</p><p>Patients with HIV and HBV coinfection should be monitored for several months following tenofovir discontinuation.</p><p>HIV-1 preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) (CDC 2018): Pregnancy test for women receiving PrEP (every 3 months); documented negative HIV test (≤1 week before initiating or reinitiating PrEP and at least every 3 months while taking PrEP), assess symptoms of side effects and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (every 3 months during therapy); renal function (prior to initiation, 3 months after initiation, then every 6 months); testing for HBV (prior to initiation) and STIs (prior to initiation, then every 3 to 6 months, even if asymptomatic).</p><p>HIV occupational postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) (Kuhar 2013): Documented HIV test (at baseline and 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after exposure); if confirmation that a fourth generation HIV p2 antigen-HIV antibody test is being used, monitor at baseline, 6 weeks and 4 months after exposure. CBC, renal and hepatic function assessments at baseline and 2 weeks after exposure (minimum recommendations, others dictated by clinical assessment).</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>The Health and Human Services (HHS) perinatal HIV guidelines consider this a preferred combination for females living with HIV who are not yet pregnant but are trying to conceive.</p><p>This combination is recommended for pre-exposure prophylaxis in couples with discordant HIV status who are planning a pregnancy. The partner without HIV should begin therapy 1 month prior to and continue for 1 month after conception is attempted (HHS [perinatal] 2019).</p><p>Refer to individual monographs for additional information.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>The Health and Human Services (HHS) perinatal HIV guidelines consider emtricitabine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to be a preferred nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone for initial therapy in antiretroviral-naive pregnant females. Emtricitabine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may also be recommended as part of a regimen when acute HIV infection is detected during pregnancy. In addition, this combination is preferred for use in pregnant females living with HIV who have had antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the past but are restarting, or who require a new ART regimen (due to poor tolerance or poor virologic response of current regimen). Females who become pregnant while taking this combination may continue if viral suppression is effective and the regimen is well tolerated.</p><p>The HHS perinatal guidelines also recommend emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as a component of regimens for HIV/hepatitis B virus-coinfected pregnant females.</p><p>Refer to individual monographs for additional information.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat HIV infection.</p><p>• It is used in HIV negative patients to lower the chance of getting HIV infection through sex.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
