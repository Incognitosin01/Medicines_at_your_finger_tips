It is a synthetic (man-made) form of a substance that is naturally produced in your body called a colony stimulating factor. Filgrastim helps the bone marrow to make new white blood cells.</p><p>When certain cancer medicines are used to fight cancer cells, they also affect the white blood cells that fight infections. Filgrastim is used to prevent or reduce the risk of infections while you are being treated with cancer medicines. Filgrastim is also used to help the bone marrow recover after a bone marrow transplantation, for a process called peripheral blood progenitor cell collection in cancer patients, and to improve survival in cancer patients who have been exposed to radiation.</p><p>Filgrastim is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using filgrastim</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
