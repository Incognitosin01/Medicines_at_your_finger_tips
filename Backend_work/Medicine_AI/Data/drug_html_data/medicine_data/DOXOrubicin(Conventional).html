Doxorubicin intercalates at points of local uncoiling of the double helix. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, it appears that direct binding to DNA (intercalation) and inhibition of DNA repair (topoisomerase II inhibition) result in blockade of DNA and RNA synthesis and fragmentation of DNA. Doxorubicin is also a powerful iron chelator; the iron-doxorubicin complex can bind DNA and cell membranes and produce free radicals that immediately cleave the DNA and cell membranes.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>V<sub>d</sub>: 809 to 1,214 L/m<sup>2</sup>; does not cross the blood-brain barrier </p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Primarily hepatic to doxorubicinol (active), then to inactive aglycones, conjugated sulfates, and glucuronides</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Feces (~40% as unchanged drug); urine (~5% to 12% as unchanged drug and metabolites)</p><p>Clearance:</p><p>Infants and Children &lt;2 years: 813 mL/minute/m<sup>2</sup> </p><p>Children and Adolescents &gt;2 years: 1,540 mL/minute/m<sup>2</sup> </p><p>Adults: 324 to 809 mL/minutes/m<sup>2</sup> (appears to be higher in men than women)</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Distribution: ~5 minutes</p><p>Terminal: 20 to 48 hours</p><p>Male: 54 hours; Female: 35 hours</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>Plasma: ~75%</p><h2>Special Populations: Hepatic Function Impairment</h2><p>Clearance is reduced.</p><h2>Special Populations Note</h2><p><b>Obesity:</b> Systemic clearance is significantly reduced in obese women with ideal body weight &gt;130%.

The risk of cardiomyopathy is proportional to the cumulative exposure with incidences from 1% to 20% for cumulative doses from 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> to 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> when doxorubicin is administered every 3 weeks. The risk of cardiomyopathy is further increased with concomitant cardiotoxic therapy.

Grade 3 and 4 leukopenia and thrombocytopenia have occurred; anemia may also occur. When administered on an every-3-week schedule, the nadir typically occurs 10 to 14 days after administration with cell count recovery by day 21. Monitor blood counts at baseline and regularly during therapy. Hematologic toxicity may require treatment interruption and/or dose reduction.</p><p>• Cardiomyopathy: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: </b><b>Myocardial damage (including acute left ventricular failure) can occur with doxorubicin with incidences from 1% to 20% for cumulative doses from 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> to 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> when doxorubicin is administered every 3 weeks. The risk of cardiomyopathy is further increased with concomitant cardiotoxic therapy. Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) before and regularly during and after doxorubicin treatment. </b>Assess LVEF by MUGA or echocardiogram; use the same assessment method at all time points; increase the frequency of assessments as the cumulative dose exceeds 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. Discontinue doxorubicin in patients who develop signs/symptoms of cardiomyopathy during treatment. Delayed cardiotoxicity may occur late in treatment or within months to years after completion of therapy, and is typically manifested by decreased LVEF and/or signs/symptoms of heart failure. The total cumulative doxorubicin dose should take into account prior treatment with other anthracyclines or anthracenediones. The risk for developing cardiotoxicity is estimated to range from 1% to 2% at cumulative lifetime doses of 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> to 6% to 20% at cumulative lifetime doses of 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> administered every 3 weeks. The risk of cardiomyopathy is increased in patients who have received radiotherapy to the mediastinum or concomitant therapy with other known cardiotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide and trastuzumab. Pericarditis and myocarditis have also been reported during or following doxorubicin treatment. Doxorubicin can result in arrhythmias, including life-threatening arrhythmias, during or within a few hours after administration and at any time point during treatment. Tachyarrhythmias (including sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and ventricular tachycardia), and bradycardia may occur; ECG changes including non-specific ST-T wave changes, atrioventricular and bundle-branch block may also occur; ECG changes may be transient and self-limiting and may not require doxorubicin dose modifications.</p><p>ASCO has developed guidelines for prevention and monitoring of cardiac dysfunction in adult survivors of cancer (ASCO [Armenian 2017]). According to the guidelines, the risk of cardiac dysfunction is increased with the following:</p><p>• High-dose anthracycline therapy (eg, doxorubicin ≥250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, epirubicin ≥600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>• High-dose radiotherapy (≥30 Gy) with the heart in the treatment field.</p><p>• Lower-dose anthracycline (eg, doxorubicin &lt;250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, epirubicin &lt;600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) in combination with lower-dose radiotherapy (&lt;30 Gy) with the heart in the treatment field.</p><p>• Lower-dose anthracycline (eg, doxorubicin &lt;250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, epirubicin &lt;600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) or trastuzumab alone AND any of the following risk factors: Multiple cardiovascular risk factors (≥2 risk factors), including smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity (during or after completion of therapy), or older age (≥60 years) at cancer treatment, or compromised cardiac function (eg, borderline low LVEF [50% to 55%], history of MI, moderate or higher valvular heart disease) before or during treatment.</p><p>• Treatment with lower-dose anthracycline (eg, doxorubicin &lt;250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, epirubicin &lt;600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) followed by trastuzumab (sequential therapy).</p><p>• Other risk factors for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity include age 60 years and older at time of treatment and 2 or more cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, or obesity) during or after treatment.</p><p>The ASCO guidelines recommend a comprehensive assessment in patients with cancer (prior to treatment) that includes a history and physical examination, screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking. An echocardiogram should be obtained prior to initiating potentially cardiotoxic therapies. Modifiable risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity) should be actively managed before initiating potentially cardiotoxic therapies. Consider cardioprotectants (eg, dexrazoxane), continuous infusions or liposomal formulations (if appropriate) in patients who are likely to receive high-dose anthracycline therapy. In patients who develop signs/symptoms of cardiac dysfunction during therapy, an echocardiogram is recommended for diagnostic workup; if echocardiogram is not available or feasible, a cardiac MRI (preferred) or MUGA scan may be utilized. Serum cardiac biomarkers are recommended, along with referral to a cardiologist if indicated.</p><p>• Extravasation: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: </b><b>Vesicant; extravasation may result in severe local tissue injury and necrosis requiring wide excision of the affected area and skin grafting. Immediately terminate infusion and apply ice to the affected area.</b> For IV administration only; do not administer by IM or subcutaneous routes. Ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during infusion. Avoid extravasation.</p><p>• GI toxicity: Doxorubicin is associated with a moderate or high emetic potential (depending on dose or regimen); antiemetics may be recommended to prevent nausea and vomiting (ASCO [Hesketh 2017]; MASCC/ESMO [Roila 2016]; POGO [Paw Cho Sing 2019]).</p><p>• Secondary malignancy: <b>[US Boxed Warnings]: Secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) </b><b>occur at a </b><b>higher incidence in patients treated with anthracyclines, including doxorubicin<b>.</b></b> AML and MDS typically occur within 1 to 3 years of treatment.</p><p>• Tumor lysis syndrome: May cause tumor lysis syndrome and hyperuricemia (in patients with rapidly growing tumors). Urinary alkalinization and prophylaxis with an antihyperuricemic agent may be necessary. Monitor electrolytes, renal function, uric acid, and hydration status.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Doxorubicin clearance is decreased in patients with elevated serum bilirubin and toxicities may be increased. Dose reduction is recommended in patients with bilirubin levels of 1.2 to 5 mg/dL. Use is contraindicated in patients with severe impairment (Child-Pugh class C or bilirubin &gt;5 mg/dL). Monitor hepatic function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) at baseline and during treatment.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Pediatric: Children are at increased risk for developing delayed cardiotoxicity; long-term periodic cardiac function monitoring is recommended. A panel from the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (ASPHO) and International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) recommends in favor of an anthracycline infusion duration of at least 1 hour in pediatric patients to reduce the potential for cardiotoxicity (ASPHO/SIOP [Loeffen 2017]). However, extravasation risks should also be minimized and the protocol infusion duration specified in a protocol should be followed, particularly if the patient is receiving dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant. Doxorubicin may contribute to prepubertal growth failure in children; may also contribute to gonadal impairment (usually temporary). Radiation recall pneumonitis has been reported in children receiving concomitant dactinomycin and doxorubicin.</p><p>• Radiation recipients: Use with caution in patients who have received radiation therapy; radiation recall may occur. May increase radiation-induced toxicity to the myocardium, mucosa, skin, and liver.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Formulations (conventional vs liposomal): Use caution when selecting product for preparation and dispensing; indications, dosages and adverse event profiles differ between conventional doxorubicin hydrochloride solution and doxorubicin liposomal. Both formulations are the same concentration. As a result, serious errors have occurred.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Vaccines: Administration of live vaccines to immunosuppressed patients may be hazardous.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential and platelet count; liver function tests (bilirubin, ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatase); serum uric acid, calcium, potassium, phosphate and creatinine; cardiac function (baseline, periodic, and followup): ECG, left ventricular ejection fraction (echocardiography [ECHO] or multigated radionuclide angiography [MUGA]). Evaluate pregnancy status prior to use in females of reproductive potential. Monitor hydration status; monitor infusion site.</p><p><i>Cardiovascular monitoring (ASCO [Armenian 2017]):</i> Comprehensive assessment prior to treatment including a history and physical examination, screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking. Echocardiogram (prior to treatment). In patients who develop signs/symptoms of cardiac dysfunction during therapy, an echocardiogram is recommended for diagnostic workup; if echocardiogram is not available or feasible, a cardiac MRI (preferred) or MUGA scan may be utilized; obtain serum cardiac biomarkers.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Evaluate pregnancy status prior to use in females of reproductive potential.</p><p>Females of reproductive potential should use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after the last doxorubicin dose.</p><p>Males with female partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 to 6 months (depending on manufacturer) after the last doxorubicin dose. In addition, males with pregnant partners should use condoms during treatment and for at least 10 days after the last dose of doxorubicin.</p><p>Doxorubicin may impair fertility in males and females. In males, doxorubicin may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue, resulting in possible genetic fetal abnormalities; may also result in oligospermia, azoospermia, and permanent loss of fertility (sperm counts have been reported to return to normal levels in some men, occurring several years after the end of therapy). In females of reproductive potential, doxorubicin may cause infertility and result in amenorrhea; premature menopause can occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Doxorubicin crosses the placenta (Ryu 2014). First trimester exposure should be avoided (Azim 2010a; Azim 2010b). A neonatal echocardiogram and ECG are recommended following intrauterine anthracycline exposure (Amant 2019).</p><p>Some pharmacokinetic properties of doxorubicin may be altered in pregnant women (Ryu 2014; van Hasselt 2014). Use of doxorubicin in pregnant women has been described for indications such as acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, and aggressive Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (Ali 2015; Azim 2011; Lishner 2016; Ring 2005).</p><p>The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) has published guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of cancer during pregnancy. The guidelines recommend referral to a facility with expertise in cancer during pregnancy and encourage a multidisciplinary team (obstetrician, neonatologist, oncology team). If chemotherapy is indicated, it should <b>not</b> be administered in the first trimester, but may begin in the second trimester. There should be a 3-week time period between the last chemotherapy dose and anticipated delivery, and chemotherapy should not be administered beyond week 33 of gestation (ESMO [Peccatori 2013]).</p><p>A pregnancy registry is available for all cancers diagnosed during pregnancy at Cooper Health (877-635-4499).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat cancer.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
