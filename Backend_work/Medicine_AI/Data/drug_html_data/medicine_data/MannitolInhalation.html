Mannitol bronchial challenge testing is for diagnostic purposes only and should be conducted only by trained professionals under a physician familiar with the test and management of acute bronchospasm (ie, testing area equipped with appropriate medications and equipment). Immediately administer a short-acting inhaled beta-agonist in the event of severe bronchospasm. Do not perform bronchial challenge testing with mannitol in a patient with asthma or very low baseline pulmonary function tests (eg, FEV1 less than 1 to 1.5 L or less than 70% of the predicted values) .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>
