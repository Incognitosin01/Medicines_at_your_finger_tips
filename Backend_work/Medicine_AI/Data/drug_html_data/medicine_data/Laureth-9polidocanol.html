It works by increasing the formation of blood clots and scar tissue inside certain types of veins. This helps decrease dilation of enlarged veins.</p><p>Laureth-9 is used to treat small uncomplicated spider veins and varicose veins in the legs. Laureth-9 will not treat varicose veins that are larger than 3 millimeters (about one-eighth of an inch) in diameter.</p><p>Laureth-9 is not a cure for varicose veins and the effects of this medication may not be permanent.</p><p>Laureth-9 may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive this medication if you have a blood clot disorder such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), swelling of a vein caused by a blood clot, or Buerger's disease.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive  laureth-9 if you are allergic to laureth-9, lauromacrogol 400, or polidocanol, or if you have:</p><ul>

You will receive this injection in a clinic or hospital setting.</p><p>The number of injections you receive will depend on the number of spider or varicose veins being treated.</p><p>Laureth-9 must be injected slowly into the vein. Your caregivers will apply slight pressure to the vein during an injection.</p><p>Tell your caregivers if you feel any burning, pain, or swelling around the IV needle when laureth-9 is injected. You will be watched closely after your injection, to make sure this medication is not causing harmful effects.</p><p>After the needle is removed from the vein, a compression bandage or stocking will be placed on the leg to prevent blood clots from forming.</p><p>When your treatment session is finished, your caregivers may want you to walk around for 15 or 20 minutes.
