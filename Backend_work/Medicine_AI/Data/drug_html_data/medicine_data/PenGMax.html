A thoroughly cleaned, sterile needle and syringe should be used for each injection (needles and syringes may be sterilized by boiling in water for 15 minutes). Before withdrawing the solution from the bottle, disinfect the rubber cap on the bottle with a suitable disinfectant such as 70 percent alcohol. The injection site should be similarly cleaned with the disinfectant. Needles of 16 to 18 gauge and 1 to 1½ inches long are adequate for intramuscular injection.</p><p><span class="Bold">INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION</span>: In livestock, intramuscular injection should be made by directing the needle of suitable gauge and length into the fleshy part of a thick muscle such as the rump, hip, or thigh region; avoid blood vessels and major nerves. Before injecting the solution, pull back gently on the plunger. If blood appears in the syringe, a blood vessel has been entered; withdraw the needle and select a different site. No more than 10mL should be injected at any one site in adult livestock; rotate injection sites for each succeeding treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Care of sick animals:</span> The use of antibiotics in the management of disease is based on an accurate diagnosis and an adequate course of treatment. When properly used in the treatment of diseases caused by penicillin-susceptible organisms. Most animals treated with Pen-G Max show a noticeable improvement within 24 to 48 hours. If improvement does not occur within this period of time, the diagnosis and course of treatment should be re-evaluated. It is recommended that the diagnosis and treatment of animal diseases be carried out by a veterinarian. Since many diseases look alike but require different types of treatment, the use of professional veterinary and laboratory services can reduce treatment time, cost, and needless losses. Good housing, sanitation, and nutrition are important in the maintenance of healthy animals and are essential in the treatment of disease</p><h2>Contains</h2><p class="First">Each mL of Pen-G Max contains 300,000 units of procaine penicillin G and approximately: 0.08% sodium citrate; 0.15% sodium carboxymethylcellulose; 25% sorbitol solution; 0.06% povidone; 0.6% lecithin; 0.1% methylparaben; 0.01% propylparaben; 0.25% phenol.</p><p><span class="Bold">Store between 2°-8°C (36°-46°F)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Restricted Drug (California- Use only as Directed</span><span class="Bold">N</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Not For Human Use</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Refer to label insert for complete directions</span> SHAKE WELL BEFORE USING.</p><p>Manufactured By Teva Animal Health, Inc.

Continue daily treatment until recovery is apparent and for at least 1 day after symptoms disappear, usually in 2 or 3 days. Treatment should not exceed 4 consecutive days.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Exceeding the highest recommended daily dosage of 3,000 units per pound of body weight, administering at recommended levels for more than 4 consecutive days, and/or exceeding 10mL intramuscularly per injection site may result in antibiotic residues beyond the withdrawal time.</p><p>Pen-G Max should be injected deep within the fleshy muscles of the hip, rump, round, or thigh. Do not inject this material subcutaneously (under the skin), into a blood vessel, or near a major nerve.</p><p>Procaine penicillin G is a substance of low toxicity. However, side effects, or so-called allergic or anaphylactic reactions-sometimes fatal, have been known to occur in animals hypersensitive to penicillin and procaine. Such reactions can occur unpredictably with varying intensity. Animals administered Pen-G Max should be kept under close observation for at least one-half hour. Should allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, discontinue use of the product and immediately administer epinephrine following manufacturer’s recommendations; call a veterinarian. As with all antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. A lack of response by the treated animal, or the development of new signs or symptoms suggest that an overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms has occurred. In such instances, consult your veterinarian. Since bactericidal drugs may interfere with the bacteriostatic action of tetracyclines, it is advisable to avoid giving penicillin in conjunction with tetracyclines. Penicillin-G should be stored between 2-8°C (36-46°F). Warm to room temperature and shake before using.</p><h2>Directions</h2><p class="First">A thoroughly cleaned, sterile needle and syringe should be used for each injection (needles and syringes may be sterilized by boiling in later for 15 minutes). Before withdrawing the solution from the bottle, disinfect the rubber cap on the bottle with a suitable disinfectant such as 70 percent alcohol. The injection site should be similarly cleaned with the disinfectant. Needles of 16 to 18 gauge and not more than 1 to 1½ inch long are adequate for injections.</p><p>A subcutaneous injection should be made by pinching up a fold of the skin between the thumb and forefinger. The mid-neck region is the preferred injection site. Insert the needle under the fold in a direction approximately parallel to the surface of the body. When the needle is inserted in this manner the medication will be delivered underneath the skin between the skin and the muscles. Proper restraint, such as the use of a chute and nose lead, is needed for proper administration of the product.</p><p><span class="Bold">SHAKE WELL BEFORE USING</span></p><p><span class="Bold">FOR ANIMAL USE ONLY</span></p><p><span class="Bold">RESTRICTED DRUG (CALIFORNIA)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">USE ONLY AS DIRECTED</span></p><p><span class="Bold">NOT FOR HUMAN USE</span></p><h2>Storage</h2><p class="First">Store between 2°-8°C (36°-46°F)</p><p>Restricted Drug (California)-Use Only As Directed</p><p>Refer to label insert for complete directions.</p><p>SHAKE WELL BEFORE USING.</p><p>Trademarks are property of Teva Animal Health, Inc.</p><p>760001-</p><p>Rev</p><p>Manufactured By Teva Animal Health, Inc.
