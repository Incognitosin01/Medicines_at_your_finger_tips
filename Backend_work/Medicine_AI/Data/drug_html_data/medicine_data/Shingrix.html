Shingrix helps prevent shingles.</p><p>Shingrix works by exposing you to a small dose of inactive virus, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>Shingrix is used to prevent herpes zoster virus (shingles) in people age 50 and older, including people who previously received a live zoster vaccine (Zostavax).</p><p>Shingrix will not treat chickenpox, shingles, or nerve pain caused by shingles (post-herpetic neuralgia).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive Shingrix if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any vaccine containing zoster virus.</p><p>You should not receive the second shot if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.</p><p>To make sure this vaccine is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to any vaccine.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive Shingrix if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to inactivated zoster virus vaccine.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to any vaccine.</p><p>It is not known whether zoster vaccine will harm an unborn baby.
