Administration of omega-3 fatty acids should be avoided in patients taking anticoagulants and in those known to have an inherited or acquired predisposition to bleeding.</p><h2>PRECAUTION</h2><p class="First">Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is deficient.
