</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Antiasthma, Anti-Inflammatory/Bronchodilator Combination</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Fluticasone</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Advair Diskus 250/50</h2><p>Fluticasone and salmeterol is a combination of two medicines that are used to help control the symptoms of asthma and improve breathing. It is used when a patient's asthma has not been controlled sufficiently on other asthma medicines, or when a patient's condition is so severe that more than one medicine is needed every day. This medicine will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.</p><p>This medicine is also used to treat air flow blockage and reduce the worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.</p><p>Inhaled fluticasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids or steroids (cortisone-like medicines). It works by preventing certain cells in the lungs and breathing passages from releasing substances that cause asthma symptoms.</p><p>Inhaled salmeterol is a long-acting bronchodilator. Bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. It relieves cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.</p><p>This medicine must be used with a short-acting medicine (eg, albuterol) for an asthma attack or asthma symptoms that need attention right away.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Advair Diskus 250/50</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>Advair® Diskus®</i> to treat asthma in children older than 4 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 4 years of age.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Advair® HFA oral inhalation</i> or <i>Airduo™ Respiclick®</i> in children younger than 12 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluticasone and salmeterol combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving this medicine. Also, elderly people with heart and blood vessel problems may require special caution when receiving fluticasone and salmeterol combination.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Advair Diskus 250/50</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain fluticasone and salmeterol.  It may not be specific to Advair Diskus 250/50. Please read with care.</b></p><p>Inhaled fluticasone and salmeterol is used to prevent asthma attacks and to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is not used to relieve an asthma attack that has already started. For relief of an asthma attack that has already started, you should use another medicine. If you do not have another medicine to use for an attack or if you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.</p><p>Inhaled fluticasone and salmeterol is used with a special inhaler that comes with a patient information leaflet or patient instructions. Read the directions carefully before using this medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the Diskus® or inhaler, ask your doctor to show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check regularly how you use the Diskus® or inhaler to make sure you are using it properly.</p><p><i>Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using this medicine without telling your doctor first. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.</p><p><i>In order for this medicine to help prevent asthma attacks, it must be used every day in regularly spaced doses, as ordered by your doctor</i>.</p><p>Do not stop using this medicine or other asthma medicines that your doctor has prescribed for you unless you have discussed this with your doctor.</p><p>When you use the <i>Advair® HFA inhaler</i> for the first time, or if you have not used it for 4 weeks or longer, or if the inhaler has been dropped, it may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first puff. Therefore, before using the inhaler, prime it by spraying the medicine four times into the air away from the face, and shaking it well for 5 seconds before each spray. Avoid spraying it in your eyes.</p><p>Rinsing your mouth with water after each dose may help prevent hoarseness, throat irritation, and infection in the mouth. However, do not swallow the water after rinsing.</p><p>To use the <i>Diskus®</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Open the foil pouch containing the Diskus®.</li>
<li>To open the Diskus®, push the thumb grip away from you as far as it will go. You will hear a click and feel a snap. When open, the mouthpiece will appear.</li>
<li>Slide the mouthpiece lever away from you as far as it will go until it clicks. The Diskus® is now ready to use. If you close the Diskus® or push the lever again, you will lose the medicine.</li>
<li>Turn your head away from the Diskus®, and breathe out to the end of a normal breath. Do not breathe into the Diskus®.</li>
<li>Holding the Diskus® level, put the mouthpiece between your lips and teeth, and close your lips around the mouthpiece. Do not bite down on the mouthpiece. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue.</li>
<li>Breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath. Do not breathe through your nose.</li>
<li>Hold your breath and remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Continue holding your breath as long as you can up to 10 seconds before breathing out slowly. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs.</li>
<li>Turn your head away from the Diskus®, and breathe out slowly to the end of a normal breath. Do not breathe into the Diskus®.</li>
<li>If your doctor has told you to inhale more than one puff of medicine at each dose, take the second puff following exactly the same steps you used for the first puff.</li>
<li>When you are finished, close the Diskus®. Place your thumb on the thumb grip, and slide it back toward you as far as it will go. You will hear it click shut.</li>
<li>Keep the Diskus® dry. Do not wash the mouthpiece, or any other part of the Diskus®. You may use a dry cloth to wipe it clean.</li>
<li>The Diskus® has a window that shows the number of doses that are left. This tells you when you are getting low on medicine. When the Diskus® has 5 doses left, the numbers from 5 to 0 will show up in red to remind you to refill your prescription.</li>
</ul><p>To use the <i>Advair® HFA inhaler</i>:</p><ul>

<li>Wait for 30 seconds and repeat these steps for the next puff, starting with shaking the inhaler.</li>
<li>Gargle and rinse your mouth with water after each dose. This will help prevent hoarseness, throat irritation, and infection in the mouth. Do not swallow the water after rinsing.</li>
<li>Replace the mouthpiece cover after using the medicine.</li>
<li>The inhaler has a window that shows the number of doses remaining. This tells you when you are getting low on medicine. The doses counting down from 20 to 0 will show up in red to remind you to refill your prescription. Throw away the inhaler when the count is 000.</li>
</ul><p>To use the <i>Airduo™ Respiclick®</i>:</p><ul>
