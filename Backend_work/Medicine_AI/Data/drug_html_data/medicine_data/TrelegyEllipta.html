Umeclidinium is an anticholinergic. Vilanterol is a bronchodilator. These medications work by relaxing muscles in the airways to improve breathing.</p><p>Trelegy Ellipta is used to improve symptoms and prevent bronchospasm in adults with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), including bronchitis and emphysema.</p><p>Trelegy Ellipta is also used in adults to prevent and control symptoms of asthma for better breathing and to prevent symptoms such as wheezing.</p><p><b>Trelegy Elliptae is not for use in treating an asthma or bronchospasm attack.</b></p><p>Vilanterol when used alone may increase the risk of death in people with asthma. However, this risk is not increased when vilanterol is used in a combination product with fluticasone and umeclidinium.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Trelegy Ellipta is not a rescue medicine for asthma or bronchospasm attacks.
