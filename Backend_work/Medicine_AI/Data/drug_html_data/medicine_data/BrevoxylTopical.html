Also, your acne may seem to get worse before it gets better. If your skin problem has not improved within 4 to 6 weeks, check with your doctor.</p><p>Certain over-the-counter (OTC) acne products may cause rare and life-threatening allergic reactions. Check with your doctor right away if you have hives, itching, trouble breathing, swelling of the eyes, face, lips, or tongue, tightness in the throat, or feeling faint while using these acne products.</p><p>Do not use an OTC acne product again if you have developed a serious allergic reaction from it.</p><p>Avoid using any other topical medicine on the same area within 1 hour before or after using benzoyl peroxide. Otherwise, benzoyl peroxide may not work properly.</p><p>Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, it is especially important to avoid using the following skin products on the same area as benzoyl peroxide:</p><ul>
<li>Any other topical acne product or skin product containing a peeling agent (eg, resorcinol, salicylic acid, sulfur, or tretinoin);</li>
<li>Hair products that are irritating, such as permanents or hair removal products;</li>
<li>Skin products that cause sensitivity to the sun, such as those containing lime or spices;</li>
<li>Skin products containing a large amount of alcohol, such as astringents, shaving creams, or after-shave lotions; or</li>
<li>Skin products that are too drying or abrasive, such as some cosmetics, soaps, or skin cleansers.</li>
</ul><p>Using these products along with benzoyl peroxide may cause mild to severe irritation of the skin. Although skin irritation can occur, some doctors sometimes allow benzoyl peroxide to be used with tretinoin to treat acne. Usually tretinoin is applied at night so that it doesn't cause a problem with any other topical products that you might use during the day. Check with your doctor before using any other topical medicines with benzoyl peroxide.</p><p>This medicine may bleach hair or colored fabrics.</p><p>Check with your doctor at any time your skin becomes too dry or irritated. Your doctor can help you choose the right skin products for you to reduce skin dryness and irritation.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Brevoxyl side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
