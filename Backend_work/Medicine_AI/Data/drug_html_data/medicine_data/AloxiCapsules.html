</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Aloxi Capsules</h2><p class="First">Aloxi Capsules are indicated in adults for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.</p><h2>Aloxi Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The recommended dosage of Aloxi Capsules in adults is 0.5 mg administered orally approximately one hour prior to the start of chemotherapy.<br/>
ALOXI can be taken with or without food <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Capsules: 0.5 mg palonosetron supplied in a light beige opaque soft gelatin capsule</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">ALOXI is contraindicated in patients known to have hypersensitivity to palonosetron <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, have been reported with administration of intravenous palonosetron HCl <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span>  These reactions occurred in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue ALOXI and initiate appropriate medical treatment.  Do not reinitiate ALOXI in patients who have previously experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonists.  Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue).  Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.</p><p>Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ALOXI and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ALOXI and initiate supportive treatment.  Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ALOXI is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First SageBodyText">Serious or otherwise clinically significant adverse reactions reported in other sections of labeling:</p><ul>
<li><span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity Reactions</span> <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Serotonin Syndrome</span> <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>In clinical trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, 161 adult patients received a single oral dose of ALOXI 0. 5 mg. The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients in two clinical trials were headache (4%) and constipation (1%).  In other clinical trials, fatigue was also reported in 1% of patients.</p><p>Less common adverse reactions, reported in less than 1%, were:</p><ul>
<li><span class="Italics">Blood and Lymphatic System: anemia.</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular: hypertension, transient arrhythmia, first degree atrioventricular block, second degree atrioventricular block, QTc prolongation.</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Hearing and Labyrinth: motion sickness.</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Eye: eye swelling.</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal System: gastritis, nausea, vomiting.</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">General: fatigue, chills, pyrexia.</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Infections: sinusitis.</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Liver: transient, asymptomatic increases in bilirubin.</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Nutrition: anorexia.</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal: joint stiffness, myalgia, pain in extremity.</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Nervous System: postural dizziness, dysgeusia.</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Psychiatric: insomnia.</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Respiratory System: dyspnea, epistaxis.</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Skin: generalized pruritus, erythema, alopecia.</span></li>
</ul><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of palonosetron HCl.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><ul>
<li><span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity reactions</span>: including dyspnea, bronchospasm, swelling/edema, erythema, pruritus, rash, urticarial, anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock with intravenous administration of palonosetron HCl <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
</ul><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Serotonergic Drugs</h3><p class="First">Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Monitor for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.  If symptoms occur, discontinue ALOXI and initiate supportive treatment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no available data on palonosetron HCl use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed with the administration of oral palonosetron HCl during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 921 and 1,841 times the recommended human oral dose in rats and rabbits, respectively <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in pregnant rats given oral palonosetron HCl at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (921 times the recommended human oral dose based on body surface area) or pregnant rabbits given oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (1,841 times the recommended human oral dose based on body surface area) during the period of organogenesis.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p class="CM28">There are no data on the presence of palonosetron in human milk, the effects of palonosetron on the breastfed infant, or the effects of palonosetron on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for ALOXI and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed infant from palonosetron or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of adult cancer patients of oral palonosetron HCl, 181 were 65 years of age and over. The number of geriatric patients receiving the 0.5 mg recommended dose of Aloxi Capsules was insufficient to draw any efficacy or safety conclusions.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no known antidote to palonosetron. Overdose should be managed with supportive care.</p><p>Dialysis studies have not been performed, however, due to the large volume of distribution, dialysis is unlikely to be an effective treatment for palonosetron overdose. A single oral dose of palonosetron HCl at 500 mg/kg in rats and 100 mg/kg in dogs (7,673 and 5,115 times the recommended human oral dose, respectively, based on body surface area) was lethal. The major signs of toxicity included convulsions, labored breathing, and salivation.</p><h2>Aloxi Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">ALOXI (palonosetron HCl) capsules contain palonosetron as palonosetron HCl, an antiemetic and antinauseant agent. It is a serotonin subtype 3 (5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span>) receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor. Chemically, palonosetron hydrochloride is: (3a<span class="Bold">S)</span>-2-[(<span class="Bold">S</span>)-1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-2,3,3a,4,5,6-hexahydro-1-oxo-1<span class="Italics">H-</span>benz[<span class="Italics">de</span>]isoquinoline hydrochloride. The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">19</span>H<span class="Sub">24</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O.HCl, with a molecular weight of 332.87. Palonosetron hydrochloride exists as a single isomer and has the following structural formula:</p><p></p><p>Palonosetron hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water, soluble in propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in ethanol and 2-propanol.</p><p>Each light beige opaque soft gelatin ALOXI capsule contains 0.5 mg palonosetron (equivalent to 0.56 mg of palonosetron HCl). Inactive ingredients are: mono- and di-glycerides of capryl/capric acid, glycerin, polyglyceryl oleate, water, and butylated hydroxyanisole.</p><h2>Aloxi Capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Palonosetron is a 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors.</p><p>Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5- HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration.</p><p>At a dose of 4.5 times the recommended dose, Aloxi Capsules do not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.</p><p>Clinical trials revealed that oral palonosetron HCl had comparable effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters as intravenous palonosetron HCl.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following oral administration, palonosetron is well absorbed with absolute bioavailability reaching 97%. After single oral doses using buffered solution, mean maximum palonosetron concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC<span class="Sub">0-</span><span class="Sub">∞</span>) were dose proportional over the dose range of 3 to 80 mcg/kg in healthy subjects.</p><p>The mean pharmacokinetic parameters after a single oral dose of 0.5 mg ALOXI are compared across studies in healthy subjects and cancer patients (Table 1). The AUC was 30% higher in cancer patients than in healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Pharmacokinetic Parameters<span class="Sup">1</span> of Palonosetron after a Single Oral Dose of 0.5 mg ALOXI in Healthy Subjects and Cancer Patients</span></p><p class="First TableParagraph"><span class="Bold">Parameter</span></p><p class="First TableParagraph"><span class="Bold">Healthy Subjects (n=36)</span></p><p class="First TableParagraph"><span class="Bold">Cancer Patients (n=12)</span></p><p class="First TableParagraph">Mean (± Standard Deviation)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">C<span class="Sub">m</span><span class="Sub">ax</span> (ng/mL)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">0.81 ± 0.17</p><p class="First TableParagraph">0.93 ± 0.34</p><p class="First TableParagraph">T<span class="Sub">max</span>  (hours)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">5.1 ± 1.7</p><p class="First TableParagraph">5.1 ± 5.9</p><p class="First TableParagraph">AUC<span class="Sub">∞</span> (ng·h/mL)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">38.2 ± 11.7</p><p class="First TableParagraph">49.7 ±12.2</p><p class="First TableParagraph">t1/2 (hours)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">37 ± 12</p><p class="First TableParagraph">48 ± 19</p><p class="SageTableReference"><span class="Sup">1</span> a cross-study comparison</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Food</span></p><p>A high fat meal did not affect the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of oral palonosetron <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 ± 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Following administration of a single oral 0.75 mg dose of [<span class="Sup">14</span>C]- palonosetron to six healthy subjects, 85% to 93% of the total radioactivity was excreted in urine, and 5% to 8% was eliminated in feces. The amount of unchanged palonosetron excreted in the urine represented approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects given Aloxi Capsules 0.5 mg, the terminal elimination half-life (t½) of palonosetron was 37 ± 12 hours (mean ± SD), and in cancer patients, t½ was 48 ± 19 hours.</p><p>After a single- dose of approximately 0.75 mg intravenous palonosetron, the total body clearance of palonosetron in healthy subjects was 160 ± 35 mL/h/kg (mean ± SD) and renal clearance was 66.5 ± 18.2 mL/h/kg.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S- hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Palonosetron is partially renally eliminated from the body.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Geriatric Patients</span></p><p>In a cross-study comparison, after a single oral 0.75 mg dose of Aloxi Capsules (1.5 times the recommended dose), the systemic exposure of palonosetron (AUC) was similar, but mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 15% lower in healthy elderly subjects 65 years of age and older compared to subjects less than 65 years of age. This decrease in exposure is not considered to be clinically meaningful.</p><p><span class="Italics">Male and Female Patients</span></p><p>In female subjects (n=18), the mean AUC was 35% higher and the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 26% higher than in male subjects (n=18).  This increase in exposure in female subjects is not considered clinically meaningful.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure to palonosetron following administration of intravenous palonosetron HCl increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Racial or Ethnic Groups</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were characterized in 32 healthy Japanese male subjects administered an oral solution of palonosetron HCl over a dose range of 3 to 90 mcg/kg. The apparent total body clearance was 26% higher in Japanese males than in white males based on a cross-study comparison; however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metoclopramide</span></p><p>A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction.</p><p><span class="Italics">Chemotherapeutic Agents, Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Drugs for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders, Antiemetics/Antinauseants</span></p><p>In controlled clinical trials, Aloxi Capsules have been safely administered with chemotherapeutic agents, systemic corticosteroids, analgesics, and drugs for gastrointestinal disorders including functional gastrointestinal disorders, acid-related disorders, and antiemetics/antinauseants.</p><p><span class="Italics">Antacids</span></p><p>Concomitant administration of an antacid (Maalox<span class="Sup">®</span> liquid 30 mL) had no effect on the oral absorption or pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 0.75 mg palonosetron HCl in healthy subjects.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, animals were treated with oral doses of palonosetron HCl at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day. Treatment with palonosetron was not tumorigenic. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of about 90 to 173 times the human exposure (AUC= 49.7 ng·h/mL) at the recommended oral dose of 0.5 mg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, male and female rats were treated with oral doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day and 15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/day, respectively. The highest doses produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of 82 and 185 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. Treatment with palonosetron produced increased incidences of adrenal benign pheochromocytoma and combined benign and malignant pheochromocytoma, increased incidences of pancreatic Islet cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma and pituitary adenoma in male rats. In female rats, it produced hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma and increased the incidences of thyroid C-cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma.</p><p>Palonosetron was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovarian cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the <span class="Italics">ex vivo</span> hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test or the mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive for clastogenic effects in the Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration test.</p><p>Palonosetron HCl at oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (about 921 times the recommended human oral dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Study 1 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind active control clinical trial of 635 patients set to receive moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. A single oral dose of 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, or 0.75 mg Aloxi Capsules given one hour prior to chemotherapy was compared to a single intravenous dose of 0.25 mg palonosetron HCl given 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to either dexamethasone or placebo in addition to their assigned treatment. The majority of patients in the study were women (73%), white (69%), and naïve to previous chemotherapy (59%). The primary efficacy endpoint was Complete Response (no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) assessed in the acute phase (0 to 24 hours). A key secondary efficacy endpoint was Complete Response assessed in the delayed phase (24 to 120 hours). Other secondary endpoints included Complete Response for the acute plus delayed phases (0-120 hours) and “no nausea” for the acute and delayed phases.</p><p>Efficacy was based on demonstrating non-inferiority of oral palonosetron doses compared to the approved intravenous product. Non-inferiority criteria were met if the lower bound of the two-sided 98.3% confidence interval for the difference in complete response rates of oral palonosetron dose minus approved intravenous product was larger than -15%. The non-inferiority margin was 15%.</p><p><span class="Bold">Efficacy Results</span></p><p>As shown in Table 2, Aloxi Capsules 0.5 mg demonstrated non- inferiority to the active comparator during the 0 to 24 hour time interval; however, for the 24 to 120 hour time period, non-inferiority was not shown. The additional two oral palonosetron dose levels showed similar results.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Proportion of Patients Achieving Complete Response Post- Chemotherapy</span></p><p class="First TableParagraph">Time Period</p><p class="First TableParagraph">Aloxi Capsules</p><p class="TableParagraph">0.5 mg (N=160)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">Intravenous Palonosetron HCl</p><p class="TableParagraph">0.25 mg (N=162)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">Difference</p><p class="TableParagraph">[Two-sided 98.3%</p><p class="TableParagraph">Confidence Interval]*:</p><p class="TableParagraph">Oral Aloxi Capsules minus Intravenous  Comparator</p><p class="First TableParagraph">Acute Phase</p><p class="TableParagraph">(0 to 24 hours)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">76.3%</p><p class="First TableParagraph">70.4%</p><p class="First TableParagraph">5.9%</p><p class="TableParagraph">[-6.5%<span class="Bold">,</span> 18.2%]</p><p class="First TableParagraph">Delayed Phase</p><p class="TableParagraph">(24 to 120 hours)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">62.5%</p><p class="First TableParagraph">65.4%</p><p class="First TableParagraph">-2.9%</p><p class="TableParagraph">[-16.3%, 10.5%]</p><p>* To adjust for multiplicity of treatment groups, a lower-bound of a two-sided 98.3% confidence interval was used to compare to -15%, the negative value of the non-inferiority margin.</p><p>As indicated in the data above, analysis of the key secondary endpoint showed that a single dose of Aloxi Capsules 0.5 mg was numerically similar to a single dose of intravenous palonosetron HCl 0.25 mg, however, statistical non-inferiority was not demonstrated. For Aloxi Capsules 0.5 mg versus intravenous palonosetron HCl 0.25 mg, the proportion of patients with complete response in the acute plus delayed phase (0 to 120 hours) was 58.8% versus 59.3%, respectively. The proportions of patients with no nausea in the acute phase (0 to 24 hours) and delayed phase (24 to 120 hours) were also numerically similar between oral and intravenous doses.</p><p>Study 2 was a multicenter, open label, repeat cycle study performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single dose oral Aloxi Capsules 0.75 mg in cancer patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. An ALOXI capsule was given to 217 cancer patients in 654 chemotherapy cycles one hour before the start of chemotherapy. Approximately 74% of patients also received single dose oral or intravenous dexamethasone 30 minutes before chemotherapy. Complete Response was not formally evaluated for the repeat cycle application. However, in general, the antiemetic effect for the 0 to 24 hour interval was similar throughout the consecutively repeated cycles.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">ALOXI (palonosetron HCl) capsules are supplied as 0.5 mg palonosetron in light beige opaque soft gelatin capsules, five capsules per bottle, each bottle packaged in a small carton (NDC #69639-104-05).</p><p><span class="Bold">Storage</span></p><ul>
