It works by decreasing TNF, a protein produced by the immune system to helps the body fight infections. In people with autoimmune disorders, the immune system produces too much TNF and mistakenly attacks healthy cells.</p><p>Enbrel is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis, and to prevent joint damage caused by these conditions.</p><p>Enbrel is also used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children who are at least 2 years old.</p><p>Enbrel is also used to treat plaque psoriasis in adults and children who are at least 4 years old.</p><p>Enbrel is sometimes used with another medicine called methotrexate when treating rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Using Enbrel may increase your risk of developing certain types of cancer, including a rare type of lymphoma.</b> Ask your doctor about your specific risk.
