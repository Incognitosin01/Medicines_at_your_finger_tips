The flowers are often white and produce fruits that range in color from black to bright red or yellow. The genus Ilex consists of over 400 species and requires a wet and equable climate. Worldwide distribution exists, except in arctic or arid regions. The major areas of distribution are Central and South America. The North American species are largely ornamental and derived from Central and South American varieties.PLANTS.Ilex.2017, Alikaridis 1987</p><p>See also Maté monograph (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil. var.).</p><h2>History</h2><p>The plants in the holly family have been used as ornamentals and in herbal medicine for centuries. Historical records show pre-Christian European pagans offering holly branches as gifts during the Roman festival of Saturnalia. Early Christians decorated their homes with holly during the Christmas season, a practice that still continues today. Settlers in the southeastern United States made yaupon tea from I. vomitoria, reserving a stronger decoction for use as an emetic. I. opaca fruit tea was used as a cardiac stimulant by the American Indians; the Chinese used it to treat coronary disease. One of the most economically important species, Ilex paraguayensis or maté tea (see the Maté monograph), has long been cultivated and used in Brazil and Paraguay as a caffeine-containing beverage. The mixed leaves of Ilex cassine, I. vomitoria, and Ilex dahoon have also been used for a hot drink called yaupon or black drink. Drinkers used it ceremonially to "cleanse" themselves, probably due to its sweat- and vomit-inducing effects. Another beverage made from the leaves of I. cassine and I. vomitoria was used as a stimulant in the southern United States during the Civil War.Alikaridis 1987, PLANTS.Yaupon.2017</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Most species contain tannins. Analyses of the leaves of I. aquifolium found tannic acid, a bitter glycoside (ilicin), ilexanthin (rutin), and ilicic acid. Some members of the genus, such as I. paraguayensis, contain xanthine alkaloids, such as caffeine, in levels as high as 2%. Other species contain saponins and triterpenes. One review of the chemistry of Ilex documented hundreds of isolated compounds. Selected examples of the various classes of chemical constituents include the following: phenols and phenolic acids (p-hydroxybenzoic acid, arbutin), anthocyanins (pelargondin 3-bioside, cyanidin 3-glucoside), flavonols and flavons (rutin, kaempferol), terpenoids (alpha-amyrin, ursolic acid), sterols (sitosterol, ergosterol), purine alkaloids (caffeine, theobromine), amino acids (aspartic acid, glutamic acid), miscellaneous nitrogen compounds (trigonelline, choline), fatty acids (oleic, linolenic), alkanes and alcohols (nonacosane, mellisyl alcohol), carbohydrates (sugar alcohols, sucrose), vitamins and carotenoids (ascorbic acid, thiamine).Alikaridis 1987, West 1977, Kashiwada 1993, Nahar 2005, Palumbo 2007</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>Chemical studies to elucidate the constituents of the Ilex species, including I. pubescens, I. vomitoria, and I. asprella, have been published.West 1977, Kashiwada 1993, Nahar 2005, Palumbo 2007 However, clinical trials for holly are lacking.</p><p>See also monograph for related Maté species (Ilex paraguariensis A.

Avoid use. Low birth weight, birth defects, and premature birth have been recorded for the related species I. paraguayensis (maté).Ernst 2002</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The leaves of most species are generally considered to be nontoxic, although the spines of some leaves may tear or puncture skin and mucous membranes.</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Although no fatalities have been reported, case reports exist of human toxicity. Ingestion of the holly berry can cause vomiting or diarrhea, and may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Stupor has been associated with poisoning. Saponins are found in some species of Ilex, but their absorption through intact mucosa is minimal. Saponins generally cause severe diarrhea and GI upset.Rodrigues 1984, Arena 1979, HolidayHint 2004</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
