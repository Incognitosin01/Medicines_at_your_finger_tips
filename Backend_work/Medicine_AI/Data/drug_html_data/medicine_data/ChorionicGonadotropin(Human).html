In females, hCG acts as a substitute for luteinizing hormone (LH) to stimulate ovulation.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Distributes mainly into the testes in males and into the ovaries in females</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (~10% to 12%) within 24 hours</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Plasma: IM: Within 6 hours</p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>IM: ~36 hours</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Biphasic: Initial: 6 to 11 hours; Terminal: 23 to 37 hours</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism:</b> Treatment of hypogonadism secondary to a pituitary deficiency in males.</p><p><b>Ovulation induction:</b> Induction of ovulation and pregnancy in the anovulatory, infertile woman in whom the cause of anovulation is secondary and not caused by primary ovarian failure, and who has been appropriately pretreated with human menotropins.</p><p><b>Prepubertal cryptorchidism:</b> Treatment of prepubertal cryptorchidism not caused by anatomic obstruction.</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Spermatogenesis induction associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism</h3><p>Based on the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Medical Guidelines for Clinical Practice for the Evaluation and Treatment of Hypogonadism in Adult Male Patients, chorionic gonadotropin (human) given in combination with human menopausal gonadotropin (or follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]) for spermatogenesis induction in male patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism of prepubertal onset is effective and recommended in this setting. Men with partial gonadotropin deficiency, men who have been peri-pubertally stimulated with chorionic gonadotropin (human), and men with postpubertal acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism who previously had normal production of sperm may be given chorionic gonadotropin (human) monotherapy.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to chorionic gonadotropin or any component of the formulation; precocious puberty; prostatic carcinoma or other androgen-dependent neoplasms</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Prepubertal males with signs of anatomical obstruction; sex hormone-dependent tumors (eg, ovary, breast and uterine carcinoma in females; breast carcinoma males); malformations of the reproductive organs incompatible with pregnancy; fibroid tumors of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy; abnormal (not menstrual) vaginal bleeding without a known/diagnosed cause.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Ovulation induction:</b> Females: IM: 5,000 to 10,000 units 1 day following last dose of menotropins</p><p><b>Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism: </b> Males: IM: Various regimens:</p><p>500 to 1,000 units 3 times/week for 3 weeks, followed by the same dose twice weekly for 3 weeks <b>or</b></p><p>4,000 units 3 times/week for 6 to 9 months, then reduce dosage to 2,000 units 3 times/week for additional 3 months</p><p><b>Spermatogenesis induction associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (off-label use): </b> Males: IM: 1,000 to 2,000 units 2 to 3 times/week. Administer hCG until serum testosterone levels are normal (may require 2 to 3 months of therapy), then may add menopausal gonadotropin of FSH if needed to induce spermatogenesis; continue hCG at the dose required to maintain testosterone levels (AACE 2002).</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, puberty induction:</b> Limited data available: Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: Males: IM: 500 to 3,000 units 2 to 3 times weekly; adjust dose based on serum testosterone levels, every 3 to 6 months (AACE 2002; Sato 2015; Sperling 2014)</p><p><b>Prepubertal cryptorchidism:</b> Children ≥4 years and Adolescents: Males: IM: Various regimens reported by manufacturer:</p><p><b>Note:</b> Therapy is usually instituted between the ages of 4 and 9 years:</p><p>4,000 units 3 times weekly for 3 weeks <b>or</b></p><p>5,000 units every second day for 4 injections <b>or </b></p><p>500 units 3 times weekly for 4 to 6 weeks (if not successful may repeat course one month later using 1,000 units/dose) <b>or </b></p><p>15 injections of 500 to 1,000 units administered over 6 weeks</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Depending on desired concentration, add 1 to 10 mL of provided diluent to lyophilized powder; agitate gently until powder is completely dissolved. Use immediately after reconstitution or store ≤60 days in the refrigerator (product dependent).</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IM: For IM administration only.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at intact vials at 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). Following reconstitution, solution is stable when refrigerated (2ºC to 8ºC [36ºF to 46ºF]) for 30 days (Novarel) or 60 days (Pregnyl).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>There are no known significant interactions.</p><h2>Test Interactions</h2><p>Cross-reacts with radioimmunoassay of gonadotropins, especially LH</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.

See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Obesity: <b>Not</b> effective adjunctive therapy in the treatment of obesity.</p><p>• Ovulation induction: Appropriate use: These medications should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management. May cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). OHSS is a rare exaggerated response to ovulation induction therapy (Corbett 2014; Fiedler 2012). This syndrome may begin within 24 hours of treatment but may become most severe 7 to 10 days after therapy (Corbett 2014). Symptoms of mild/moderate OHSS may include abdominal distention/discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, and/or vomiting. Severe OHSS symptoms may include severe abdominal pain, anuria/oliguria, ascites, severe dyspnea, hypotension, or nausea/vomiting (intractable). Decreased creatinine clearance, hemoconcentration, hypoproteinemia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated WBC, and electrolyte imbalances may also be present (ASRM 2016; Corbett 2014; Fiedler 2012). Treatment is primarily symptomatic and includes fluid and electrolyte management, analgesics, and prevention of thromboembolic complications (ASRM 2016; Shmorgun 2017). Multiple births may result from the use of these medications; advise patients of the potential risk of multiple births before starting the treatment.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Male: Serum testosterone levels, semen analysis (AACE 2002).</p><p>Female: Ultrasound and/or estradiol levels to assess follicle development; ultrasound to assess number and size of follicles; ovulation (basal body temperature, serum progestin level, menstruation, sonography).</p><p>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: Monitoring of hospitalized patients should include abdominal circumference, albumin, cardiorespiratory status, electrolytes, fluid balance, hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum creatinine, urine output, urine specific gravity, vital signs, weight (all daily or as necessary), and liver enzymes (weekly) (Shmorgun 2017).</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>When needed for ovulation induction, should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management. Multiple births may result from use of this medication.</p><p>Testicular tumors in otherwise healthy men have been reported when treating secondary infertility.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Studies in animals have shown evidence of fetal abnormalities at doses intended to induce superovulation (used in combination regimens).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to help women get pregnant.</p><p>• It is used to help the body make more testosterone in some people.</p><p>• It is used to treat delays in a male's normal growth pattern.</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons. Talk with the doctor.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects. However, many people have no side effects or only have minor side effects.
