High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk for heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if the blood pressure is controlled.</p><p>Clonidine belongs to the class of medicines called antihypertensives. It works in the brain to change some of the nerve impulses. As a result, the blood vessels relax and blood passes through them more easily, which lowers blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen going to the heart is increased.</p><p>This medicine will not cure your high blood pressure, but it does help control it. Therefore, you must continue to use it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. You might have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Catapres-TTS-2</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of clonidine transdermal in geriatric patients.

Blood tests may be needed to check for any unwanted effects.</p><p>Do not interrupt or stop using this medicine without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. Your blood pressure may become worse when the medicine is stopped suddenly, which can cause serious side effects.</p><p>Make sure that you have enough clonidine transdermal on hand to last through weekends, holidays, or vacations. You should not miss any doses. You may want to ask your doctor for a second written prescription for clonidine to carry in your wallet or purse. You can have it filled if you run out of medicine when you are away from home.</p><p>You may have some skin redness, a rash, itching, or blistering at the place where you wear the patch. If this irritation is severe or does not go away, call your doctor. Do not remove the patch unless your doctor tells you to.</p><p>Before having any kind of surgery (including dental surgery) or emergency treatment, tell the medical doctor or dentist in charge that you are using this medicine.</p><p>Before having a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, tell the doctor in charge that you are using this medicine. Skin burns may occur at the site where the patch is worn during this procedure. Ask your doctor if the patch should be removed before having an MRI scan. You might need to put on a new patch after the procedure.</p><p>Clonidine transdermal may cause some people to become drowsy or less alert than they are normally. This is more likely to happen when you begin to use it or when you increase the amount of medicine you are using. <i>Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert</i>.</p><p>Clonidine transdermal will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. CNS depressants are medicines that slow down the nervous system and may cause drowsiness. Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, allergies, or colds; sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine; prescription pain medicine or narcotics; barbiturates or medicine for seizures; muscle relaxants; or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. <i>Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are using this medicine</i>.</p><p>This medicine may cause dryness of the eyes. If you wear contact lenses, this may be a problem for you. Talk to your doctor if you wear contact lenses, and discuss how to treat the dryness.</p><p>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur after you use this medicine, especially when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help, but if the problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.</p><p>The dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting is also more likely to occur if you drink alcohol, stand for long periods of time, exercise, or if the weather is hot. While you are using clonidine, be careful to limit the amount of alcohol you drink. Also, use extra care during exercise or hot weather or if you must stand for a long time.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements. You should avoid over-the-counter [OTC] medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems, since they may tend to increase your blood pressure.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Catapres-TTS-2 side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
