</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Trospium Chloride</h2><p class="First">Trospium Chloride tablets are a muscarinic antagonist indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency.</p><h2>Trospium Chloride Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The recommended dose is 20 mg twice daily. Trospium Chloride tablets should be dosed at least one hour before meals or given on an empty stomach.</p><p>Dosage modification is recommended in the following patient populations:</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Trospium Chloride tablets are supplied as 20 mg tablets (round, white to off white, film coated tablets. Imprinted "HP" with black ink on one side and "530" on the reverse side).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Trospium Chloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Risk of Urinary Retention</h3><p class="First">Trospium Chloride tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><h3>Angioedema</h3><p class="First">Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with Trospium Chloride, the active ingredient in Trospium Chloride tablets. In one case, angioedema occurred after the first dose of Trospium Chloride. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, Trospium Chloride should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided.</p><h3>Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility</h3><p class="First">Trospium should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>]. Trospium Chloride, like other antimuscarinic agents, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, intestinal atony and myasthenia gravis.</p><h3>Controlled Narrow-angle Glaucoma</h3><p class="First">In patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma, Trospium Chloride should only be used if the potential benefits outweigh the risks and in that circumstance only with careful monitoring [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><h3>Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">Trospium Chloride is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including dizziness, confusion, hallucinations and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Trospium Chloride affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered.</p><h3>Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Patients with Moderate Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Trospium is substantially excreted by the kidney. The effects of moderate renal impairment on systemic exposure are not known but systemic exposure is likely increased. Therefore, anticholinergic adverse reactions (including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, and urinary retention) are expected to be greater in patients with moderate renal impairment [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</span>].</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The safety of Trospium Chloride was evaluated in controlled clinical trials in a total of 2975 patients, who were treated with Trospium Chloride (N=1673), placebo (N=1056) or active control medications (N=246). Of this total, 1181 patients participated in two, 12-week, U.S., efficacy and safety studies and a 9-month open-label extension. Of this total, 591 patients received Trospium Chloride tablets 20 mg twice daily. In all controlled trials combined, 232 and 208 patients received treatment with Trospium Chloride for at least 24 and 52 weeks, respectively.</p><p>In all placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidence of serious adverse events was 2.9% among patients receiving Trospium Chloride tablets 20 mg twice daily and 1.5% among patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists adverse reactions from the combined 12-week U.S. safety and efficacy trials were reported by at least 1% of patients, and were reported more frequently in the Trospium Chloride group than in the placebo group.</p><p>The two most common adverse reactions reported by patients receiving Trospium Chloride tablets 20 mg twice daily were dry mouth and constipation. The single most frequently reported adverse reaction for Trospium Chloride tablets, dry mouth, occurred in 20.1% of Trospium Chloride treated patients and 5.8% of patients receiving placebo. In the two U.S. studies, dry mouth led to discontinuation in 1.9% of patients treated with Trospium Chloride tablets 20 mg twice daily. For the patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reaction</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span><br/>

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Gastrointestinal – gastritis; Cardiovascular – palpitations, supraventricular tachycardia, chest pain, syncope, "hypertensive crisis"; Immunological – Stevens-Johnson syndrome, anaphylactic reaction, angioedema; Nervous System – dizziness, confusion, vision abnormal, hallucinations, somnolence and delirium; Musculoskeletal – rhabdomyolysis; General – rash.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Digoxin</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of Trospium Chloride and digoxin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Drugs Eliminated by Active Tubular Secretion</h3><p class="First">Although demonstrated in a drug-drug interaction study not to affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, Trospium Chloride has the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion (e.g., procainamide, pancuronium, morphine, vancomycin, and tenofovir). Coadministration of Trospium Chloride with these drugs may increase the serum concentration of Trospium Chloride and/or the coadministered drug due to competition for this elimination pathway. Careful patient monitoring is recommended in patients receiving such drugs [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Antimuscarinic Agents</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of Trospium Chloride with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Trospium Chloride may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility.</p><h3>Metformin</h3><p class="First">Co-administration of 500 mg metformin immediate release tablets twice daily with SANCTURA XR<span class="Sup">®+</span> (Trospium Chloride 60 mg extended release capsules) reduced the steady-state systemic exposure of trospium by approximately 29% for mean AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> and by 34% for mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C:</span> There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Trospium Chloride in pregnant women. Trospium Chloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk to the patient and fetus. Women who become pregnant during Trospium Chloride treatment are encouraged to contact their physician.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Based on animal data, Trospium Chloride is predicted to have a low probability of increased risk of adverse developmental outcomes, above background risk. Adverse developmental findings were not observed to correlate with dose in rats or in rabbits. No increased risk above background was observed in rats and rabbits treated at an exposure approximately equivalent to the maximal recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg.</p><p><span class="Bold">Animal Data</span></p><p>In a rat embryo/fetal development study, pregnant rats received doses of Trospium Chloride up to 200 mg/kg/day, from implantation to closure of the fetal hard palate, with maternal systemic exposures corresponding to approximately nine times the exposure of women treated at the MRHD of 40 mg, based on AUC. No malformations or fetal toxicity were observed.</p><p>The offspring of female rats exposed orally, pre- and post-natally, to Trospium Chloride up to 200 mg/kg/day showed no increased developmental toxicity over background in surviving pups. However, maternal toxicity (death, irregular breathing, increased excitability) was observed at 200 mg/kg/day. A no-effect level for maternal and pup toxicity (survival to Day 4) was 20 mg/kg/day, an exposure approximately equivalent to the maximal recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg.</p><p>In a rabbit embryo/fetal development study, pregnant rabbits received doses of Trospium Chloride up to 200 mg/kg/day, from implantation to closure of the fetal hard palate. At 200 mg/kg/day, maternal systemic exposures corresponded to approximately 16 times the exposure of women treated at the MRHD of 40 mg, based on AUC. However, one fetus in each of the three treated dose groups (0.3 to 16 times exposures at the MRHD) demonstrated multiple malformations, including umbilical hernia and skeletal malformations. A maternal no-effect level was set at 20 mg/kg/day, at an exposure approximately equivalent to the maximal recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, due to clinical signs (reduced feces, hunched posture, diarrhea) observed in a pharmacokinetic study at 200 mg/kg/day.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">The effect of Trospium Chloride tablets on labor and delivery is unknown.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Trospium Chloride (2 mg/kg orally and 50 mcg/kg intravenously) was excreted, to a limited extent (less than 1%), into the milk of lactating rats (primarily as parent compound). It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, Trospium Chloride should be used during lactation only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the newborn.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Trospium Chloride in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 591 patients with overactive bladder who received treatment with Trospium Chloride in the two U.S., placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety studies, 249 patients (42%) were 65 years of age and older. Eighty-eight Trospium Chloride treated patients (15%) were greater than or equal to 75 years of age.</p><p>In these 2 studies, the incidence of commonly reported anticholinergic adverse reactions in patients treated with Trospium Chloride (including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, and urinary retention) was higher in patients 75 years of age and older as compared to younger patients. This effect may be related to an enhanced sensitivity to anticholinergic agents in this patient population [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. Therefore, based upon tolerability, the dose frequency of Trospium Chloride may be reduced to 20 mg once daily in patients 75 years of age and older.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/minute) significantly altered the disposition of Trospium Chloride. A 4.2-fold and 1.8-fold increase in mean AUC<span class="Sub">(0-∞)</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span>, respectively, and the appearance of an additional elimination phase with a long half-life (~33 hr) were detected in patients with severe renal impairment compared with nearly age-matched subjects with creatinine clearance equal to or higher than 80 mL/min. The different pharmacokinetic behavior of Trospium Chloride in patients with severe renal impairment necessitates adjustment of dosage frequency [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2)</span>]. The pharmacokinetics of trospium have not been studied in patients with creatinine clearance ranging from 30-80 mL/min.</p><p>Trospium is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">There is no information regarding the effect of severe hepatic impairment on exposure to Trospium Chloride. In a study of patients with mild and with moderate hepatic impairment, given 40 mg of immediate-release Trospium Chloride, mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> increased 12% and 63%, respectively, and mean AUC<span class="Sub">(0-∞)</span> decreased 5% and 15%, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Caution should be used when administering Trospium Chloride to patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdosage with antimuscarinic agents, including Trospium Chloride, can result in severe antimuscarinic effects. Supportive treatment should be provided according to symptoms. In the event of overdosage, electrocardiographic monitoring is recommended.</p><p>A 7-month-old baby experienced tachycardia and mydriasis after administration of a single dose of trospium 10 mg given by a sibling. The baby's weight was reported as 5 kg. Following admission into the hospital and about 1 hour after ingestion of the trospium, medicinal charcoal was administered for detoxification. While hospitalized, the baby experienced mydriasis and tachycardia up to 230 beats per minute. Therapeutic intervention was not deemed necessary. The baby was discharged as completely recovered the following day.</p><h2>Trospium Chloride Description</h2><p class="First">Trospium Chloride is a quaternary ammonium compound with the chemical name of Spiro [8-azoniabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-8,1'-pyrrolidinium], 3-[(hydroxydiphenylacetyl)oxy]-, chloride, (1α, 3β, 5α). The empirical formula of Trospium Chloride is C<span class="Sub">25</span>H<span class="Sub">30</span>ClNO<span class="Sub">3</span> and its molecular weight is 427.96. The structural formula of Trospium Chloride is represented below:</p><p>Trospium Chloride is a white or almost white, crystalline powder. The compound is very soluble in water.</p><p>Each Trospium Chloride tablet intended for oral administration contains 20 mg of Trospium Chloride, a muscarinic antagonist, for oral administration. Each Trospium Chloride tablet also contains the following inactive ingredients: black iron oxide, confectioners' sugar, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, povidone, propylene glycol, shellac, silicon dioxide, talc and titanium dioxide.</p><p> Product meets USP Dissolution Test 2.</p><h2>Trospium Chloride - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Trospium Chloride is a muscarinic antagonist.</p><p>Trospium Chloride antagonizes the effect of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in cholinergically innervated organs including the bladder. Its parasympatholytic action reduces the tonus of smooth muscle in the bladder.</p><p>Receptor assays showed that Trospium Chloride has negligible affinity for nicotinic receptors as compared to muscarinic receptors at concentrations obtained from therapeutic doses.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Placebo-controlled studies employing urodynamic variables were conducted in patients with conditions characterized by involuntary detrusor contractions. The results demonstrate that Trospium Chloride increases maximum cystometric bladder capacity and volume at first detrusor contraction.</p><p><span class="Bold">Electrophysiology</span></p><p>The effect of 20 mg twice daily and up to 100 mg twice daily of Trospium Chloride on QT interval was evaluated in a single-blind, randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) controlled 5 day parallel trial in 170 male and female healthy volunteer subjects aged 18 to 45 years. The QT interval was measured over a 24-hour period at steady state. The 100 mg twice daily dose of Trospium Chloride was chosen because this achieves the C<span class="Sub">max</span> expected in severe renal impairment. Trospium Chloride was not associated with an increase in individual corrected (QTcI) or Fridericia corrected (QTcF) QT interval at any time during steady state measurement, while moxifloxacin was associated with a 6.4 msec increase in QTcF.</p><p>In this study, asymptomatic, non-specific T wave inversions were observed more often in subjects receiving Trospium Chloride than in subjects receiving moxifloxacin or placebo following five days of treatment. This finding was not observed during routine safety monitoring in 2 other placebo-controlled clinical trials in 591 Trospium Chloride treated overactive bladder patients [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14)</span>]. The clinical significance of T wave inversion in this study is unknown. Trospium Chloride is associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing plasma concentrations. In the study described above, Trospium Chloride demonstrated a mean increase in heart rate compared to placebo of 9.1 bpm for the 20 mg dose and of 18 bpm for the 100 mg dose. In the two U.S. placebo-controlled trials in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increase in heart rate compared to placebo in Study 1 was observed to be 3 bpm and in Study 2 was 4 bpm.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption:</span> After oral administration, less than 10% of the dose is absorbed. Mean absolute bioavailability of a 20 mg dose is 9.6% (range: 4 to 16.1%). Peak plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) occur between 5 to 6 hours post-dose. Mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> increases greater than dose-proportionally; a 3-fold and 4-fold increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> was observed for dose increases from 20 mg to 40 mg and from 20 mg to 60 mg, respectively. AUC exhibits dose linearity for single doses up to 60 mg. Trospium Chloride exhibits diurnal variability in exposure with a decrease in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of up to 59% and 33%, respectively, for evening relative to morning doses.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Food:</span> Administration with a high (50%) fat-content meal resulted in reduced absorption, with AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> values 70 to 80% lower than those obtained when Trospium Chloride was administered while fasting. Therefore, it is recommended that Trospium Chloride should be taken at least one hour prior to meals or on an empty stomach [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2)</span>].</p><p>A summary of mean (± standard deviation) pharmacokinetic parameters for a single 20 mg dose of Trospium Chloride tablets is provided in Table 2.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">C <span class="Sub">max</span></span> (ng/mL)<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">AUC <span class="Sub">0-∞</span></span> (ng/mL•hr)<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">T <span class="Sub">max</span></span> (hr)<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">t <span class="Sub">½</span></span> (hr)<br/></p><p class="First">3.5 ± 4.0<br/></p><p class="First">36.4 ± 21.8<br/></p><p class="First">5.3 ± 1.2<br/></p><p class="First">18.3 ± 3.2<br/></p><p>The mean plasma concentration-time (+ SD) profile for Trospium Chloride is shown in Figure 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1 - Mean (+ SD) Concentration-Time Profile for a Single 20 mg Oral Dose of Trospium Chloride Tablets in Healthy Volunteers</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span>: Protein binding ranged from 50 to 85% when concentration levels of Trospium Chloride (0.5 to 50 ng/mL) were incubated with human serum <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>.</p><p>The <span class="Sup">3</span>H-Trospium Chloride ratio of plasma to whole blood was 1.6:1. This ratio indicates that the majority of <span class="Sup">3</span>H-trospium chloride is distributed in plasma.</p><p>The apparent volume of distribution for a 20 mg oral dose is 395 (± 140) liters.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism:</span> The metabolic pathway of trospium in humans has not been fully defined. Of the 10% of the dose absorbed, metabolites account for approximately 40% of the excreted dose following oral administration. The major metabolic pathway is hypothesized as ester hydrolysis with subsequent conjugation of benzylic acid to form azoniaspironortropanol with glucuronic acid. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is not expected to contribute significantly to the elimination of trospium. Data taken from <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human liver microsomes investigating the inhibitory effect of trospium on seven CYP isoenzyme substrates (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) suggest a lack of inhibition at clinically relevant concentrations.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion:</span> The plasma half-life for Trospium Chloride following oral administration is approximately 20 hours. After oral administration of an immediate-release formulation of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-Trospium Chloride, the majority of the dose (85.2%) was recovered in feces and a smaller amount (5.8% of the dose) was recovered in urine; 60% of the radioactivity excreted in urine was unchanged trospium.</p><p>The mean renal clearance for trospium (29.07 L/hour) is 4-fold higher than average glomerular filtration rate, indicating that active tubular secretion is a major route of elimination for trospium. There may be competition for elimination with other compounds that are also renally eliminated [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.2)</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Digoxin:</span> Concomitant use of 20 mg Trospium Chloride immediate release tablets twice daily at steady state and a single dose of 0.5 mg digoxin in a crossover study with 40 male and female subjects did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metformin:</span> A drug interaction study was conducted in which SANCTURA XR<span class="Sup">®+</span> 60 [an extended release form of Trospium Chloride capsules, 60 mg] once daily was co-administered with Glucophage<span class="Sup">®++</span> (metformin hydrochloride) 500 mg twice daily under steady-state conditions in 44 healthy subjects. Co-administration of 500 mg metformin immediate release tablets twice daily reduced the steady-state systemic exposure of trospium by approximately 29% for mean AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> and by 34% for mean C<span class="Sub">max</span>. The effect of decrease in trospium exposure on the efficacy of SANCTURA XR<span class="Sup">®+</span> [an extended release form of Trospium Chloride capsules, 60 mg] is unknown. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of metformin were comparable when administered with or without 60 mg SANCTURA XR<span class="Sup">®+</span> [an extended release form of Trospium Chloride capsules, 60 mg] once daily under fasted condition. The effect of metformin at higher doses on trospium PK is unknown.</p><p><span class="Italics">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Age:</span> Age did not appear to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of Trospium Chloride, however, increased anticholinergic side effects unrelated to drug exposure were observed in patients greater than or equal to 75 years of age [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric:</span> The pharmacokinetics of Trospium Chloride were not evaluated in pediatric patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Race:</span> Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gender:</span> Studies comparing the pharmacokinetics in different genders had conflicting results. When a single 40 mg Trospium Chloride tablets dose was administered to 16 elderly subjects, exposure was 45% lower in elderly females compared to elderly males. When 20 mg Trospium Chloride tablets was dosed twice daily for 4 days to 6 elderly males and 6 elderly females (60 to 75 years), AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were 26% and 68% higher, respectively, in females without hormone replacement therapy than in males.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment:</span> In a clinical pharmacokinetic study where a single dose of 40 mg immediate release Trospium Chloride was administered to 12 healthy males and 12 males with severe renal impairment, severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/minute) significantly altered the disposition of Trospium Chloride.

No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was found in either mice or rats administered up to 200 mg/kg/day, approximately 9 times the expected clinical exposure levels at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg.</p><p><span class="Italics">Mutagenesis:</span> Trospium Chloride was not mutagenic nor genotoxic in tests <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in bacteria (Ames test) and mammalian cells (L5178Y mouse lymphoma and CHO cells) or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in the rat micronucleus test.</p><p><span class="Italics">Impairment of Fertility:</span> No evidence of impaired fertility was observed in rats administered doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (about 16 times the expected clinical exposure at the MRHD, based on AUC).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Trospium Chloride was evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder who had symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence in two U.S. 12-week, placebo-controlled studies and one 9-month open label extension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Study 1</span> was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 523 patients. A total of 262 patients received Trospium Chloride tablets 20 mg twice daily and 261 patients received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (85%) and female (74%) with a mean age of 61 years (range: 21 to 90 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge), urge incontinence episodes of at least 7 per week, and greater than 70 micturitions per week. The patient's medical history and urinary diary during the treatment-free baseline confirmed the diagnosis. Reductions in urinary frequency, urge incontinence episodes and urinary void volume for placebo and Trospium Chloride treatment groups are summarized in Table 3 and Figures 2 and 3.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Efficacy endpoint</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo N=256</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Trospium Chloride   N=253</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">P-value</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Urinary frequency/24 hours <span class="Sup">a,*</span></span><br/>
