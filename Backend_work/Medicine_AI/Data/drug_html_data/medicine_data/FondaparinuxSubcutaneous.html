Use of indwelling epidural catheters, concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis (eg, NSAIDs, platelet inhibitors, or other anticoagulants), history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, spinal deformity, or spinal surgery may increase the risk of developing these hematomas. Monitor patients frequently for neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

These blood clots can travel to the lungs and can become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing a condition called pulmonary embolism. Fondaparinux is used for several days after hip fracture surgery, hip or knee replacement surgery, and in some cases following abdominal or stomach surgery, while you are unable to walk. It is during this time that blood clots are most likely to form.</p><p>Fondaparinux is also used together with warfarin to treat acute deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg) and pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung).</p><p>Fondaparinux is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using fondaparinux</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For fondaparinux, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to fondaparinux or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of fondaparinux in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fondaparinux in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have bleeding problems and age-related kidney disease, which may require caution or an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving fondaparinux.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking fondaparinux, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using fondaparinux with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>

Blood tests will be needed to check for unwanted effects. Be sure to keep all appointments.</p><p>Fondaparinux may cause bleeding problems. This risk is higher if you have a catheter in your back for pain medicine or anesthesia (sometimes called an "epidural"), or if you have kidney problems. The risk of bleeding increases if your kidney problems get worse. Check with your doctor right away if you have any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, bleeding gums, blood in the urine or stools, tingling, numbness, or weakness of the lower legs, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</p><p>You may bleed or bruise more easily while you are using fondaparinux. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers. Avoid nose picking and forceful nose blowing.</p><p>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</p><p>Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using fondaparinux. You may need to stop using fondaparinux several days before having surgery or medical tests.</p><p>Also, tell your doctor if you have received fondaparinux or heparin before and had a reaction called thrombocytopenia (low platelet count in the blood), or if new blood clots formed while you were receiving the medicine.</p><p>Fondaparinux may increase your risk of having spinal or epidural blood clots when it is used together with certain other medicines or procedures. Check with your doctor right away if you have midline back pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the legs or feet, or loss of control of the bowel or bladder (incontinence).</p><p>The needle guard of the prefilled syringe of fondaparinux contains dry natural latex rubber. Tell your doctor if you have any allergies with latex or rubber.</p><p><i>Check with your doctor before you start or stop taking any other medicine, or change the amount you are taking</i>.
