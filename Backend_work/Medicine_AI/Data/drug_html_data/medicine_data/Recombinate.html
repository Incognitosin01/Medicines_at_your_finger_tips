In culture, the CHO cell line secretes recombinant Factor VIII (rFVIII) into the cell culture medium. The rFVIII is purified from the culture medium utilizing a series of chromatography columns. A key step in the purification process is an immunoaffinity chromatography methodology in which a purification matrix, prepared by immobilization of a monoclonal antibody directed to Factor VIII, is utilized to selectively isolate the rFVIII in the medium. The synthesized rFVIII produced by the CHO cells has the same biological effects as human Factor VIII. Structurally the protein has a similar combination of heterogenous heavy and light chains as found in human Factor VIII.</p><p>Recombinate is formulated as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, off-white to faint yellow, lyophilized powder preparation of concentrated recombinant Factor VIII for intravenous injection. Recombinate is available in single-dose vials, which contain nominally 250, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 International Units per vial. When reconstituted with the appropriate volume of diluent, the product contains the following stabilizers in maximum amounts: For 5 mL reconstitution volume: 25 mg/mL Albumin (Human), 0.40 mg/mL calcium, 3 mg/mL polyethylene glycol (3350), 360 mEq/L sodium, 110 mM histidine, 1.5 µg/Factor VIII International Unit (IU) polysorbate-80. Recombinant Von Willebrand Factor (rVWF) is coexpressed with the rFVIII and helps to stabilize it. The final product contains not more than 2 ng rVWF/IU rFVIII, which will not have any clinically relevant effect in patients with von Willebrand's disease. The product contains no preservative.</p><p>Each vial of Recombinate is labeled with the Factor VIII activity expressed in IU per vial. Biological potency is determined by an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assay which is referenced to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for Factor VIII:C Concentrate.</p><h2>Recombinate - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Factor VIII is the specific clotting factor deficient in patients with hemophilia A (classical hemophilia). Hemophilia A is a genetic bleeding disorder characterized by hemorrhages, which may occur spontaneously or after minor trauma. The administration of Recombinate provides an increase in plasma levels of Factor VIII and can temporarily correct the coagulation defect in these patients. Pharmacokinetic studies on sixty-nine (69) patients revealed the circulating mean half-life for Recombinate to be 14.6 ± 4.9 hours (n=67), which was not statistically significantly different from plasma-derived HEMOFIL M, [Antihemophilic Factor (Human), Method M, Monoclonal Purified]. The mean half-life of HEMOFIL M was 14.7 ± 5.1 hours (n=61). The actual baseline recovery observed with Recombinate was 123.9 ± 47.7 IU/dL (n=23), which is significantly higher than the actual HEMOFIL M baseline recovery of 101.7 ± 31.6 IU/dL (n=61). However, the calculated ratio of actual to expected recovery with Recombinate (121.2 ± 48.9%) is not different on average from HEMOFIL M (123.4 ± 16.4%).</p><p>The clinical study of  Recombinate in previously treated patients (individuals with hemophilia A who had been treated with plasma derived Factor VIII) was based on observations made on a study group of 69 patients. These individuals received cumulative amounts of Factor VIII ranging from 20,914 to 1,383,063 IU over the 48 month study. Patients were given a total of 17,700 infusions totaling 28,090,769 IU Recombinate.</p><p>These patients were successfully treated for bleeding episodes on a demand basis and also for the prevention of bleeds (prophylaxis). Spontaneous bleeding episodes successfully managed include hemarthroses, soft tissue and muscle bleeds. Management of hemostasis was also evaluated in surgeries. A total of 24 procedures on 13 patients were performed during this study. These included minor (e.g. tooth extraction) and major (e.g. bilateral osteotomies, thoracotomy and liver transplant) procedures. Hemostasis was maintained perioperatively and postoperatively with individualized Factor VIII replacement.</p><p>A study of Recombinate in previously untreated patients was also performed as part of an ongoing study. The study group was comprised of seventy-nine (79)<span class="Sup">1</span> patients, of whom seventy-six (76) had received at least one infusion of Recombinate. To date, this cohort has been given 12,209 infusions totaling over 11,277,043 IU of Recombinate. Hemostasis was appropriately managed in spontaneous bleeding episodes, intracranial hemorrhage and surgical procedures.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Recombinate</h2><p class="First">The use of Recombinate [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)] is indicated in hemophilia A (classical hemophilia) for the prevention and control of hemorrhagic episodes.<span class="Sup">2</span> Recombinate is also indicated in the perioperative management of patients with hemophilia A (classical hemophilia).</p><p>Recombinate can be of therapeutic value in patients with acquired Factor VIII inhibitors not exceeding 10 Bethesda Units per mL.<span class="Sup">3</span>  In clinical studies with Recombinate, patients with inhibitors who were entered into the previously treated patient trial and those previously untreated children who have developed inhibitor activity on study, showed clinical hemostatic response when the titer of inhibitor was less than 10 Bethesda Units per mL. However, in such uses, the dosage of Recombinate should be controlled by frequent laboratory determinations of circulating Factor VIII levels as well as the clinical status of the patient.</p><p>Recombinate is not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Recombinate is contraindicated in patients who have manifested life-threatening immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to the product or its components, including bovine, mouse or hamster proteins.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">The clinical response to Recombinate may vary. If bleeding is not controlled with the recommended dose, the plasma level of factor VIII should be determined and a sufficient dose of Recombinate should be administered to achieve a satisfactory clinical response. If the patient's plasma factor VIII level fails to increase as expected or if bleeding is not controlled after the expected dose, the presence of an inhibitor (neutralizing antibodies) should be suspected and appropriate testing performed. (see <span class="Italics">PRECAUTIONS - Monitoring Laboratory Tests</span>).</p><h3>Anaphylaxis and Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with Recombinate and have been manifested as dizziness, pruritus, rash, urticaria, flushing, angioedema/face swelling, laryngeal edema, dyspnea, pallor, pyrexia, nausea, paresthesia, hypotension, and loss of consciousness. Discontinue Recombinate if symptoms occur and seek immediate emergency treatment. Recombinate contains trace amounts of bovine proteins, mouse immunoglobulin G (MuIgG), and hamster (CHO) proteins. Patients treated with this product may develop hypersensitivity to these non-human mammalian proteins.</p><h3>Neutralizing Antibodies</h3><p class="First">Patients treated with antihemophilic factor (AHF) products should be carefully monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. Inhibitors have been reported following administration of Recombinate predominantly in previously untreated and minimally treated patients. The risk of developing inhibitors is highest during the first 20 exposure days. If expected plasma factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an expected dose, an assay that measures factor VIII inhibitor concentration should be performed (<span class="Italics">see PRECAUTIONS - Monitoring Laboratory Tests</span>).</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First"> Certain components used in the packaging of this product contain natural rubber latex.</p><p><span class="Bold">Identification of the clotting defect as a Factor VIII deficiency is essential before the administration of Recombinate [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)] is initiated.</span> No benefit may be expected from this product in treating other deficiencies.</p><h3>Formation of Antibodies to Mouse, Hamster or Bovine Protein</h3><p class="First">As Recombinate contains trace amounts of mouse protein (maximum of 0.1 ng/IU Recombinate), hamster protein (maximum of 1.5 ng CHO protein/IU Recombinate), and bovine protein (maximum of 1 ng BSA/IU Recombinate), the remote possibility exists that patients treated with this product may develop hypersensitivity to these non-human mammalian proteins.<br/></p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">The patient and physician should discuss the risks and benefits of this product.</p><p>Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions have been observed with Recombinate. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalized urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, symptoms of laryngeal edema, and anaphylaxis. Patients should be advised to discontinue use of the product and contact their physician if these symptoms occur. Additionally, patients should be informed that local tissue irritation may occur when infusing Recombinate reconstituted with 5 mL sWFI.</p><h3>Monitoring Laboratory Tests</h3><ul>
<li>Monitor plasma factor VIII activity levels by the one-stage clotting assay to confirm the adequate factor VIII levels have been achieved and maintained, when clinically indicated. (see <span class="Italics">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</li>
<li>Monitor for development of factor VIII inhibitors. Perform assay to determine if factor VIII inhibitor is present if expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with the expected dose of Recombinate. Use Bethesda Units (BU) to titer inhibitors.
<ul>
<li>If the inhibitor is less than 10 BU per mL, the administration of additional Recombinate concentrate may neutralize the inhibitor, and may permit an appropriate hemostatic response.</li>
<li>Adequate hemostasis may not be achieved if inhibitor titers are above 10 BU per mL. The inhibitor titer may rise following Recombinate infusion as a result of an anamnestic response to factor VIII. The treatment or prevention of bleeding in such patients requires the use of alternative therapeutic approaches and agents.</li>

</ul><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Recombinate was tested for mutagenicity at doses considerably exceeding plasma concentrations of Factor VIII <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and at doses up to ten times the expected maximum clinical dose <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>, and did not cause reverse mutations, chromosomal aberrations, or an increase in micronuclei in bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes. Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Recombinate is appropriate for use in children of all ages, including the newborn. Safety and efficacy studies have been performed in both previously treated (n=23) and previously untreated (n=75) children. (See <span class="Italics">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span> and <span class="Italics">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Recombinate. The safety of Recombinate for use in pregnant women has not been established. It is not known whether Recombinate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Physicians should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits for each specific patient before prescribing Recombinate. Recombinate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted into human milk. Because many drugs are excreted into human milk, caution should be exercised if Recombinate is administered to nursing mothers. Recombinate should be given to nursing mothers only if clinically needed.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials</h3><p class="First">During controlled clinical studies with Recombinate enrolling 210 subjects, the most commonly reported adverse drug reactions were chills, flushing, rash and epistaxis.</p><p class="First">Chills</p><p>Fatigue</p><p class="First">3</p><p>1</p><p class="First">1.43</p><p>0.48</p><p class="First">Dizziness</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.48</p><p class="First">Hyperhidrosis</p><p>Pruritus</p><p>Rash</p><p class="First">1</p><p>1</p><p>2</p><p class="First">0.48</p><p>0.48</p><p>0.95</p><p class="First">Epistaxis</p><p>Flushing</p><p>Hematoma</p><p>Hypotension</p><p>Pallor</p><p class="First">1†</p><p>2</p><p>1</p><p>1</p><p>1</p><p class="First">0.48</p><p>0.95</p><p>0.48</p><p>0.48</p><p>0.48</p><p>During the Previously Treated Patients (PTP) study, none of the 71 subjects developed <span class="Italics">de novo</span> evidence of Factor VIII inhibitor. However, during the phase II/III portion of the study, 1 subject with a history of inhibitors exhibited inhibitor activity at 6 months (0.8 Bethesda Units [BU]), which resolved by 9 months. One other subject in this study had detectable Factor VIII inhibitor at baseline (1.26 BU) and exhibited an anamnestic response at 6 months (10.3 BU). During a prospective pharmaco-surveillance study of subjects who received batches of Recombinate containing modestly increased Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell protein levels, none of the 34 treated subjects developed a Factor VIII inhibitor.</p><p>During the Previously Untreated Patients (PUP) study, 22 of the 73 evaluable subjects developed inhibitors to Factor VIII. Of these, 13 subjects displayed no detectable Factor VIII inhibitors at study exit.</p><h3>Post-Marketing Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">In addition to the adverse reactions noted in clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported in the post-marketing experience. These adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA (version 12.1) System Organ Class (SOC), then by MedDRA coding system Preferred Term in order of severity.</p><p><span class="Bold">BLOOD AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEM DISORDERS:</span> Factor VIII inhibition</p><p> <span class="Bold">CARDIAC DISORDERS:</span> Tachycardia, Cyanosis</p><p><span class="Bold">GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS:</span> Vomiting, Abdominal pain</p><p><span class="Bold">GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS:</span> Malaise, Injection site reactions, Chest pain, Chest discomfort</p><p><span class="Bold">IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDERS:</span> Anaphylactic reaction, Hypersensitivity</p><p><span class="Bold">NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS:</span> Loss of consciousness, Headache, Paresthesia</p><p><span class="Bold">RESPIRATORY, THORACIC AND MEDIASTINAL DISORDERS:</span> Dyspnea, Cough, Laryngeal edema</p><p><span class="Bold">SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE DISORDERS:</span> Angioedema, Urticaria, Erythema</p><h2>Recombinate Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Each vial of Recombinate is labeled with the Factor VIII activity expressed in IU per vial. This potency assignment is referenced to the World Health Organization International Standard for Factor VIII:C Concentrate and is evaluated by appropriate methodology to ensure accuracy of the results.</p><p>The expected <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> peak increase in Factor VIII level expressed as IU/dL of plasma or % (percent) of normal can be estimated by multiplying the dose administered per kg body weight (IU/kg) by two. This calculation is based on the clinical findings of Abildgaard <span class="Italics">et al</span> <span class="Sup">4</span> and is supported by the data generated by 419 clinical pharmacokinetic studies with Recombinate in 67 patients over time. This pharmacokinetic data demonstrated a peak recovery point above the pre-infusion baseline of approximately 2.0 IU/dL per IU/kg body weight.</p><p>Examples (Assuming patient's baseline Factor VIII level is at &lt;1%):</p><h3>Recommended Dosage Schedule</h3><p class="First">Physician supervision of the dosage is required. The following dosage schedule may be used as a guide.</p><p>If bleeding is not controlled with the recommended dose, the plasma level of Factor VIII should be determined and a sufficient dose of Recombinate should be administered to achieve a satisfactory clinical response.</p><p>The careful control of the substitution therapy is especially important in cases of major surgery or life threatening hemorrhages. In presence of a low titer inhibitor, doses larger than those recommended may be necessary as per standard care.</p><p>Although dosage can be estimated by the calculations above, it is strongly recommended that whenever possible, appropriate laboratory tests including serial Factor VIII assays be performed on the patient's plasma at suitable intervals to assure that adequate Factor VIII levels have been reached and are maintained.</p><p>Patients should be evaluated for the development of Factor VIII inhibitors, if the expected plasma Factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose.</p><h3>Reconstitution: Use Aseptic Technique</h3><p class="First">NOTE: Do not refrigerate after reconstitution. (see <span class="Italics">Administration</span>)</p><h3>Administration: Use Aseptic Technique</h3><p class="First">Recombinate is administered by intravenous (IV) injection after reconstitution.</p><p>Administer at room temperature.<br/>
Recombinate should be administered not more than 3 hours after reconstitution.</p><p><span class="Bold">Intravenous Syringe Injection</span></p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The solution should be colorless to faint yellow in appearance. If not, do not use the solution and notify Baxalta immediately.</p><p>Plastic syringes are recommended for use with this product since proteins such as Recombinate tend to stick to the surface of glass syringes.</p><h3>Rate of Administration</h3><p class="First">The rate of administration should be a rate that ensures the comfort of the patient. Preparations of Recombinate can be administered at a rate of up to 5 mL per minute when reconstituted with 5 mL of sWFI.</p><p>The pulse rate should be determined before and during administration of Recombinate. Should a significant increase in pulse rate occur, reducing the rate of administration or temporarily halting the injection usually allows the symptoms to disappear promptly.</p><h2>How is Recombinate Supplied</h2><p class="First">Recombinate is available in five different strengths in single-dose vials. The strength is designated on the outer box and on the vial label using the following color codes:</p><p>Recombinate is packaged with 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, a BAXJECT II Needleless Transfer Device, one physician insert and one patient insert.</p><h2>Storage</h2><p class="First">Recombinate can be refrigerated [2° - 8°C (36° - 46°F)] or stored at room temperature, not to exceed 30°C (86°F). Avoid freezing to prevent damage to the diluent vial. Do not use beyond the expiration date printed on the box.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Over the investigational period of the original safety and efficacy study of Recombinate, none of the 69 subjects without an inhibitor at entry into the study, developed an inhibitor. In the previously untreated patient group there were 73 eligible subjects with Factor VIII levels less than or equal to 2% who received at least one Recombinate treatment (median days 100, range 3-821) and who were tested for an inhibitor after treatment with Recombinate. Of this group, 23 individuals (32%) developed a detectable inhibitor (median days on treatment at time of detection 10, range 3-69) and of these, 8 subjects (11%) showed a titer greater than 10 B.U.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">To enroll in the confidential, industry-wide Patient Notification System, call 1-888-873-2838.</p><p>BAXALTA<span class="Sup">®</span>, BAXJECT<span class="Sup">®</span> and Recombinate<span class="Sup">®</span> are trademarks of Baxalta Incorporated, a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Shire plc.</p><p>SHIRE and the Shire Logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Shire Pharmaceutical Holdings Ireland Limited or its affiliates.</p><p>Manufactured by:<br/>

Recombinate<br/>
[Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)]<br/>
(For intravenous use only)</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Do not attempt to do an infusion to yourself unless you have been taught how by your doctor or hemophilia center.<br/>
<br/></span></p><p>1.    In a quiet place, prepare a clean flat surface and gather all the materials you will need for the infusion. Check the expiration date, and let the vial with the Recombinate concentrate and the Sterile Water for Injection, USP (diluent) warm up to room temperature. Wash your hands and put on clean exam gloves. If infusing yourself at home, the use of gloves is optional.</p><p>2.    Remove caps from the Recombinate concentrate and diluent vials to expose the centers of the rubber stoppers.</p><p>3.    Disinfect the stoppers with an alcohol swab (or other suitable solution suggested by your doctor or hemophilia center) by rubbing the stoppers firmly for several seconds, and allow to dry prior to use. Place the vials on a flat surface.</p><p>4.    Open the BAXJECT II device package by peeling away the lid, without touching the inside of the package. <span class="Bold">Do not remove the BAXJECT II device from the package.</span></p><p>5.    Turn the package with the BAXJECT II device upside down, and place it over the top of the diluent vial. Fully insert the clear plastic spike of the device into the center of the diluent vial's stopper by pushing straight down. Grip the package at its edge and lift it off the device. Be careful not to touch the white plastic spike. <span class="Bold">Do not remove the blue cap from the BAXJECT II device.<br/>
<br/></span> The diluent vial now has the BAXJECT II device connected to it and is ready to be connected to the Recombinate vial.</p><p>6.    To connect the diluent vial to the Recombinate vial, turn the diluent vial over and place it on top of the vial containing Recombinate concentrate. Fully insert the white plastic spike into the Recombinate vial's stopper by pushing straight down. Diluent will flow into the Recombinate vial. This should be done right away to keep the liquid free of germs.</p><p>7.    Swirl the connected vials gently and continuously until the Recombinate is completely dissolved. <span class="Bold">Do not shake</span>. The Recombinate solution should be colorless to light-yellow in appearance. If not, do not use it and notify Baxalta immediately.</p><p>8.   Take off the blue cap from the BAXJECT II device and connect the syringe. <span class="Bold">BE CAREFUL TO NOT INJECT AIR</span>.</p><p>9.    Turn over the connected vials so that the Recombinate vial is on top. Draw the Recombinate solution into the syringe by pulling back the plunger slowly. Disconnect the syringe from the vials. Attach the infusion needle to the syringe using a winged (butterfly) infusion set, if available. Point the needle up and remove any air bubbles by gently tapping the syringe with your finger and slowly and carefully pushing air out of the syringe and needle.</p><p>If you are using more than one vial of Recombinate, the contents of more than one vial may be drawn into the same syringe. However, you will need a separate diluent and BAXJECT II device to mix each additional vial of Recombinate.</p><p>10.
