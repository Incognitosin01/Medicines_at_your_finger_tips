Its structure is as follows:</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">C<span class="Sub">16</span>H<span class="Sub">19</span>BrN<span class="Sub">2</span> • C<span class="Sub">4</span>H<span class="Sub">4</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>                             M.W. 435.31</p><p>Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride is a nasal decongestant with the chemical name:</p><p>benzenemethanol, α-[1-(methylamino)ethyl]-, [S-(R*,R*)]-, hydrochloride. Its structure is as follows:</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">C<span class="Sub">10</span>H<span class="Sub">15</span>NO • HCl                                 M.W. 201.69</p><h2>LoHist PD - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Brompheniramine maleate</span> is a histamine antagonist, specifically an H<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptor-blocking agent belonging to the alkylamine class of antihistamines. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for receptor sites on effector cells. Brompheniramine also has anticholinergic (drying) and sedative effects. Among the antihistaminic effects, it antagonizes the allergic response (vasodilatation, increased vascular permeability, increased mucus secretion) of nasal tissue. Brompheniramine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with peak plasma concentration after single, oral doses of 4 mg reached in 5 hours; urinary excretion is the major route of elimination, mostly as products of biodegradation; the liver is assumed to be the main site of metabolic transformation.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride</span> is an orally effective nasal decongestant that acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the mucosa of the respiratory tract producing vasoconstriction. Pseudoephedrine shrinks swollen nasal mucous membranes, reduces tissue hyperemia, edema, and nasal congestion and increases nasal airway patency. Eustachian ostia may be opened. Pseudoephedrine produces little if any rebound congestion.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for LoHist PD</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">LoHist PD</span> is indicated for the temporary relief of nasal congestion and pressure, runny nose, sneezing, itching of the nose or throat, and itchy watery eyes, due to hay fever, or other upper respiratory allergies (allergic rhinitis).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">LoHist PD</span> is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to any of its ingredients, patients taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or for two weeks after stopping the MAOI drug (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions section), patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, peptic ulcer, severe hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, patients with breathing problems such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, or nursing mothers. Antihistamines should not be used to treat lower respiratory tract conditions including asthma.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Do not exceed recommended dosage.</span> If nervousness, dizziness, or sleeplessness occur, discontinue use and consult a physician. If symptoms do not improve within 7 days or are accompanied by fever, consult a physician.</p><p>Sympathomimetic amines should be used judiciously and sparingly in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism or prostatic hypertrophy. Sympathomimetics may produce central nervous system stimulation with convulsions or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension.</p><p>Antihistamines may impair mental and physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery, and may impair mental alertness in children. In the young child, they may produce excitation.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Because of its antihistamine component, LoHist PD should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, narrow angle glaucoma, gastrointestinal obstruction, or urinary bladder neck obstruction. Because of its sympathomimetic component, this syrup should be used with caution in patients with diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, or thyroid disease.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Antihistamines may cause drowsiness and ambulatory patients who operate machinery or motor vehicles should be cautioned accordingly.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">MAO inhibitors and beta adrenergic blockers increase the effect of sympathomimetics. Sympathomimetics may reduce the antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine and veratrum alkaloids. Concomitant use of antihistamines with alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates and other CNS depressants may have an additive effect.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C:</span> Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with LoHist PD. It is also not known whether LoHist PD can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. LoHist PD should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from LoHist PD, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Hyperreactive individuals may display ephedrine-like reactions such as tachycardia, palpitations, headache, dizziness, or nausea. Patients sensitive to antihistamines may experience mild sedation. Sympathomimetic drugs have been associated with certain untoward reactions including fear, anxiety, tenseness, restlessness, tremor, weakness, pallor, respiratory difficulty, dysuria, insomnia, hallucinations, convulsions, CNS depression, arrhythmias, and cardiovascular collapse with hypotension.</p><p>Possible side effects of antihistamines are drowsiness, restlessness, dizziness, weakness, dry mouth, anorexia, nausea, headache, nervousness, blurring of vision, heartburn, dysuria and very rarely dermatitis. Patient idiosyncrasy to adrenergic agents may be manifested by insomnia, dizziness, weakness, tremor or arrhythmias.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">No information is available as to specific results of an overdose of LoHist PD. The signs, symptoms and treatment described below are those of H<span class="Sub">1</span> antihistamines, and ephedrine overdose.</p><p><span class="Italics">Symptoms:</span> Should antihistamine effects predominate, central action constitutes the greatest danger. In the small child, symptoms include excitation, hallucination, ataxia, incoordination, tremors, flushed face and fever. Convulsions, fixed and dilated pupils, coma and death may occur in severe cases. In the adult, fever and flushing are uncommon; excitement leading to convulsion and postictal depression is often preceded by drowsiness and coma. Respiration is usually not seriously depressed; blood pressure is usually stable.</p><p>Should sympathomimetic symptoms predominate, central effects include restlessness, dizziness, tremor, hyperactive reflexes, talkativeness, irritability and insomnia. Cardiovascular and renal effects include difficulty in micturition, headache, flushing, palpitation, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension with subsequent hypotension and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal effects include dry mouth, metallic taste, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps.</p><p><span class="Italics">Treatment:</span> The stomach should be emptied promptly by emetics and/or gastric lavage. The installation of activated charcoal also should be considered. Cardiac function and serum electrolytes should be monitored and treatment initiated if indicated. If convulsions or marked CNS excitement occurs, diazepam may be used.</p><h2>LoHist PD Dosage and Administration</h2><h2>How is LoHist PD Supplied</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">LoHist PD Pediatric Drops</span> is supplied in bottles of 1 fl. oz.
