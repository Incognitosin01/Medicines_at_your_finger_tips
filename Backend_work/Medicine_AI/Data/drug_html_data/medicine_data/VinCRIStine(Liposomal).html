Do not reuse kit components with future doses.</p><p><b>Water bath process:</b></p><p>1). Outside the sterile area, fill a water bath to a depth of at least 8 cm (3.2 inches); water should be heated to and maintained at <b>63°C to 67°C</b> (145.4°F to 152.6°F) for the entire procedure (use calibrated thermometer to monitor temperature). Maintain water depth of at least 8 cm (3.2 inches) throughout process. Water bath must remain outside the sterile area.</p><p>2). In a biological safety cabinet, vent the sodium phosphate vial with a sterile venting needle (with a 0.2 micron filter or other suitable venting device). Venting needle should always be kept above liquid level. Remove 1 mL of sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposome injection and inject into the sodium phosphate vial. Withdraw 5 mL of vincristine sulfate injection and inject into the sodium phosphate vial. Remove the venting needle and gently invert the sodium phosphate vial 5 times to mix (do <b>not </b>shake). Place flotation ring on the sodium phosphate vial.</p><p>3). Confirm the water bath is maintained between <b>63°C to 67°C</b> (145.4°F to 152.6°F). Outside the sterile area, place constituted sodium phosphate vial in the water bath for 10 minutes. Record constitution start and stop time, as well as starting and ending water temperature. After 10 minutes, remove the vial (with tongs), remove flotation ring, then dry the vial, affix vial overlabel, and gently invert 5 times to mix (do <b>not</b> shake).</p><p><b>Block heater process (do NOT use water):</b></p><p>1). Arrange the 3 heater blocks in the block heater; the block holding the constitution vial is centered between the 2 other blank heater blocks (refer to manufacturer labeling for further information). Place a calibrated thermometer in the block opening adjacent to the vial well; thermometer should remain in the block opening through preparation. Turn on block heater and set to 75°C (167°F); verify block temperature (temperature should be 75°C ± 2°C). Equilibrate at this temperature for 15 minutes; maintain block temperature throughout procedure. The flotation ring included in the kit is not required with the block heater process.</p><p>2). In a biological safety cabinet, vent the sodium phosphate vial with a sterile venting needle (with a 0.2-micron filter or other suitable venting device). Venting needle should always be kept above liquid level. Remove 1 mL of sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposome injection and inject into the sodium phosphate vial. Withdraw 5 mL of vincristine sulfate injection and inject into the sodium phosphate vial. Remove the venting needle and gently invert the sodium phosphate vial 5 times to mix (do <b>not </b>shake).</p><p>3). Confirm the block heater temperature is <b>73°C to 77°C</b> (163.4°F to 170.6°F). Outside the sterile area, place constituted sodium phosphate vial into the block heater for 18 minutes. Record constitution start and stop time, as well as starting and ending block heater temperature. After 18 minutes, remove the vial (with tongs), affix vial overlabel, and gently invert 5 times to mix (do <b>not</b> shake).</p><p><b>Following water or block heater process:</b> Allow the vial to equilibrate for at least 30 minutes at room temperature (15°C to 30°C [59°F to 86°F]), but for no longer than 12 hours. Once prepared, vincristine sulfate liposome concentration is 5 mg per 31 mL (0.16 mg/mL). Return vial to biologic safety cabinet. Calculate patient's vincristine liposome dose (based on actual BSA); remove corresponding volume from 100 mL NS or D5W infusion bag. Inject vincristine liposome dose into the infusion bag (final volume of 100 mL). Do not use if a precipitate or other foreign matter is present in the vial or infusion bag. The amount contained in each vial may exceed the prescribed dose; use care with dosage and volume calculations. Discard unused portion of the vial. After preparation, keep liposomal vincristine in a location away from the separate storage location recommended for medications intended for CNS administration.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p><b>For IV administration only. Fatal if given by other routes.</b> Liposomal vincristine should <b>NOT</b> be delivered to the patient at the same time as any medications intended for CNS administration.</p><p><b>IV:</b> Infuse over 1 hour. Do not administer IV push or bolus; do not use with in-line filters. Do not administer with other medications. Infusion must be completed within 12 hours of initiation of preparation.</p><p>Extravasation of liposomal vincristine may cause tissue injury, although the extent and incidence are not defined; conventional vincristine is a vesicant. Ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during infusion; avoid extravasation. If extravasation occurs, discontinue liposomal vincristine infusion immediately and institute appropriate extravasation management procedures.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store intact kit (containing vincristine vial, sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposome vial, and sodium phosphate vial) at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F); do not freeze. Use appropriate precautions for handling and disposal. Once prepared and diluted in D5W or NS, liposomal vincristine is stable for no more than 12 hours at room temperature; administration should be completed within 12 hours of the initiation of preparation. After preparation, keep liposomal vincristine in a location away from the separate storage location recommended for medications intended for CNS administration.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>5-Aminosalicylic Acid Derivatives: May enhance the myelosuppressive effect of Myelosuppressive Agents.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Abametapir: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Aprepitant: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>BCG (Intravesical): Myelosuppressive Agents may diminish the therapeutic effect of BCG (Intravesical). <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Chloramphenicol (Ophthalmic): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Myelosuppressive Agents.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Cladribine: May enhance the myelosuppressive effect of Myelosuppressive Agents.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Clofazimine: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>CloZAPine: Myelosuppressive Agents may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of CloZAPine.

Death has occurred with intrathecal administration.</p><p>Vincristine (liposomal) injection has different dosage recommendations than vincristine injection. Verify drug name and dose prior to preparation and administration to avoid overdosage.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Bone marrow suppression: Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia may occur, including grade 3 and greater events. Monitor blood counts prior to each liposomal vincristine dose and as clinically necessary and adjust dose or withhold therapy if necessary. Consider supportive care measures.</p><p>• Constipation: Constipation, ileus, bowel obstruction, and colonic pseudo-obstruction have occurred with liposomal vincristine. Patients should be initiated on a prophylactic bowel regimen including a stool softener, dietary fiber, and hydration; additional laxative treatments may be considered.</p><p>• Extravasation: Extravasation may occur with liposomal vincristine and causes tissue injury. Avoid extravasation of liposomal vincristine (conventional vincristine is a vesicant). Administer through a secure and free-flowing venous access line. Check for proper needle/catheter placement prior to and during infusion. If extravasation occurs, discontinue liposomal vincristine infusion immediately and institute appropriate extravasation management procedures.</p><p>• Fatigue: Severe fatigue was noted in clinical trials; consider treatment delay, dosage adjustment, and/or discontinuation as necessary.</p><p>• Hepatitis B virus screening: The American Society of Clinical Oncology hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management provisional clinical opinion (ASCO [Hwang 2020]) recommends HBV screening with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.</p><p>• Hepatotoxicity: Hepatotoxicity (including fatal cases) and increased AST (including grade 3 and higher events) have been reported. Monitor hepatic function tests; reduce dose or interrupt therapy if necessary. Use caution in patients with hepatic impairment; conventional vincristine undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. Liposomal vincristine has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. In a study in a limited number of melanoma patients with moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment secondary to liver metastases, C<sub>max</sub> and AUC were comparable to those in patients with normal hepatic function; patients with hepatic impairment received a liposomal vincristine dose of 1 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>every 2 weeks versus 2 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in subjects with normal hepatic function (Bedikian 2011).</p><p>• Neurotoxicity: Neuropathies (sensory and motor) are common and cumulative. Monitor for symptoms of neuropathy (peripheral motor and sensory, central, and autonomic), which may include paresthesia, hyper-/hypoesthesia, hyporeflexia or areflexia, neuralgia, jaw pain, decreased vibratory sense, cranial neuropathy, ileus, burning sensation, arthralgia, myalgia, muscle spasm, and/or weakness. Evaluate neurologic status of patients closely prior to liposomal vincristine administration; neurologic toxicity risk is greater when given to patients with preexisting neuromuscular conditions or when used concomitantly with other neurotoxic agents. Administer liposomal vincristine to patients with preexisting neuropathy only after careful risk-benefit assessment. Treatment delay, dosage adjustment, and/or discontinuation may be necessary, based on neurotoxicity severity.</p><p>• Tumor lysis syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome may occur as a consequence of therapy; monitor closely for signs and symptoms and manage accordingly.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Liposomal vs conventional formulation dosing: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Vincristine liposomal and conventional vincristine are NOT interchangeable. Dosing differs between formulations; verify intended product and dose prior to preparation and administration to avoid overdoses.</b></p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• For IV use only: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: For IV administration only. Fatal if given by other routes; inadvertent intrathecal administration has resulted in death. </b>Liposomal vincristine should <b>NOT</b> be prepared during the preparation of any medications intended for CNS administration. After preparation, keep liposomal vincristine in a location <b>away</b> from the separate storage location recommended for medications intended for CNS administration. Liposomal vincristine should <b>NOT</b> be delivered to the patient at the same time with any medications intended for CNS administration.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential and platelets; hepatic function; signs/symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or other neurologic toxicities; sodium (in elderly patients; conventional vincristine may cause or exacerbate hyponatremia or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion). Hepatitis B virus screening with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) prior to beginning systemic anticancer therapy (ASCO [Hwang 2020]). Evaluate pregnancy status prior to therapy initiation (in females of reproductive potential). Monitor for signs/symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome; symptoms of constipation; monitor infusion site for extravasation.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Verify pregnancy status prior to treatment initiation in females of reproductive potential. Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during therapy and for 6 months after the last vincristine (liposomal) dose. Males with female partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during therapy and for 3 months after the last vincristine (liposomal) dose.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Based on the mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, in utero exposure to vincristine (liposomal) may cause fetal harm.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat a type of leukemia.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
