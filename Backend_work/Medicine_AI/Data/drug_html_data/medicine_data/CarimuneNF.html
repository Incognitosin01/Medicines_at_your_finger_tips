<li><span class="Bold">Thrombosis may occur with immune globulin products<span class="Sup">1-8</span>, including Carimune NF. Risk factors may include: advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling central vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. Thrombosis may occur in the absence of known risk factors (see PRECAUTIONS: Thrombosis and Information for Patients).</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death may occur in predisposed patients with immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) products<span class="Sup">9–14</span>, including Carimune NF. Patients predisposed to renal dysfunction include those with any degree of pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, age greater than 65, volume depletion, sepsis, paraproteinemia, or patients receiving known nephrotoxic drugs. Renal dysfunction and acute renal failure occur more commonly in patients receiving IGIV products containing sucrose. Carimune NF contains sucrose.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">For patients at risk of thrombosis, renal dysfunction or acute renal failure, administer Carimune NF at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration.

</ul><h2>Carimune NF Description</h2><p class="First">Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF, Nanofiltered, Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), is a sterile, highly purified polyvalent antibody product containing in concentrated form all the IgG antibodies which regularly occur in the donor population.<span class="Sup">15</span> This immunoglobulin preparation is produced by cold alcohol fractionation from the plasma of US donors. Part of the fractionation may be performed by another US-licensed manufacturer. Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF is made suitable for intravenous use by treatment at acid pH in the presence of trace amounts of pepsin.<span class="Sup">16,17</span> The manufacturing process by which Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF is prepared from plasma consists of fractionation and purification steps that comprise filtrations in the presence of filter aids. Four of these steps were validated for virus elimination of both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Additionally, the manufacturing process was investigated for its capacity to decrease the infectivity of an experimental agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), considered as a model for the vCJD and CJD agents.<span class="Sup">18</span> To complement the existing virus elimination / inactivation mechanism in the Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF manufacturing process, nanofiltration (removing viruses via size-exclusion) was introduced as an additional virus removal step into the manufacturing process.<span class="Sup">19,20</span> Nanofiltration is performed prior to the viral inactivation step (pH 4 in presence of pepsin) in order to reduce the potential viral load before inactivation is performed. Treatment with pepsin at pH 4 rapidly inactivates enveloped viruses.<span class="Sup">21</span></p><p>The Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF manufacturing process provides a significant virus reduction capacity as shown in in vitro studies. The results, summarized in Table 1, demonstrate virus clearance during Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF manufacturing using model viruses for lipid enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.</p><p>PRV and the two model viruses for HCV, BVDV and SFV, were inactivated within 1/10, and HIV within 1/2 of the incubation time (pH 4/pepsin treatment) used during production of Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF.</p><p>Several of the individual production steps in the Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF manufacturing process have been shown to decrease TSE infectivity of an experimental model agent. TSE reduction steps include precipitation (3.5 logs), depth filtrations (7.3 logs), and nanofiltration (4.4 logs). These studies provide reasonable assurance that low levels of CJD/vCJD agent infectivity, if present in the starting material, would be removed.</p><p>The preparation contains at least 96% of IgG and after reconstitution with a neutral unbuffered diluent has a pH of 6.6 ± 0.2. Most of the immunoglobulins are monomeric (7 S) IgG; the remainder consists of dimeric IgG and a small amount of polymeric IgG, traces of IgA and IgM and immunoglobulin fragments.<span class="Sup">22</span> The distribution of the IgG subclasses corresponds to that of normal serum.<span class="Sup">23-26</span> Final container lyophilized units are prepared so as to contain 3, 6, or 12 g protein with 1.67 g sucrose and less than 20 mg NaCl per gram of protein. The lyophilized preparation contains no preservative and may be reconstituted with sterile water, 5% dextrose or 0.9% saline to a solution with protein concentrations ranging from 3% to 12% (see Table 4). See Table 2 for calculated Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF osmolality (mOsm/kg) at each protein concentration. The patient's fluid, electrolyte, caloric requirements and renal function should be considered in selecting an appropriate diluent and concentration.</p><h2>Carimune NF - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF contains a broad spectrum of antibody specificities against bacterial, viral, parasitic, and mycoplasma antigens, that are capable of both opsonization and neutralization of microbes and toxins. The 3 week half-life of Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF corresponds to that of Immune Globulin (Human) for intramuscular use, although individual variations in half-life have been observed.<span class="Sup">27,28</span></p><p>Appropriate doses of Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF restore abnormally low immunoglobulin G levels to the normal range. One hundred percent of the infused dose of IGIV-products is available in the recipient's circulation immediately after infusion. After approximately 6 days, equilibrium is reached between the intra- and extravascular compartments, with immunoglobulin G being distributed approximately 50% intravascular and 50% extravascular. In comparison, after the intramuscular injection of immune globulin, the IgG requires 2–5 days to reach its maximum concentration in the intravascular compartment. This concentration corresponds to about 40% of the injected dose.<span class="Sup">28</span></p><p>While Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF has been shown to be effective in some cases of Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) (see <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span>), the mechanism of action in ITP has not been fully elucidated. Toxicity from overdose has not been observed on regimens of 0.4 g/kg body weight each day for 5 days.<span class="Sup">29-31</span> Sucrose is added to Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF for reasons of stability and solubility. Since sucrose is excreted unchanged in the urine when given intravenously, Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF may be given to diabetics without compensatory changes in insulin dosage regimen. Please see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> section.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Carimune NF</h2><h3>Immunodeficiency</h3><p class="First">Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with primary immunodeficiencies (PID), e.g., common variable immunodeficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, severe combined immunodeficiency.<span class="Sup">30,32-34</span> Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF is preferable to intramuscular Immune Globulin (Human) preparations in treating patients who require an immediate and large increase in the intravascular immunoglobulin level<span class="Sup">28</span>, in patients with limited muscle mass, and in patients with bleeding tendencies for whom intramuscular injections are contraindicated. The infusions must be repeated at regular intervals.</p><p>Please see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span> section.</p><h3>Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)</h3><p class="First">A controlled study was performed in children in which Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> was compared with steroids for the treatment of acute (defined as less than 6 months duration) ITP. In this study sequential platelet levels of 30,000, 100,000, and 150,000/µL were all achieved faster with Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> than with steroids and without any of the side effects associated with steroids.<span class="Sup">29,35</span> However, it should be noted that many cases of acute ITP in childhood resolve spontaneously within weeks to months. Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> has been used with good results in the treatment of acute ITP in adult patients.<span class="Sup">36-38</span> In a study involving 10 adults with ITP of less than 16 weeks duration, Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> therapy raised the platelet count to the normal range after a 5 day course. This effect lasted a mean of over 173 days, ranging from 30 to 372 days.<span class="Sup">39</span></p><p class="First">Children and adults with chronic (defined as greater than 6 months duration) ITP have also shown an increase (sometimes temporary) in platelet counts upon administration of Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span>.<span class="Sup">35,39-43</span> Therefore, in situations that require a rapid rise in platelet count, for example prior to surgery or to control excessive bleeding, use of Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> should be considered. In children with chronic ITP, Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> therapy resulted in a mean rise in platelet count of 312,000/µL with a duration of increase ranging from 2 to 6 months.<span class="Sup">40,43</span> Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> therapy may be considered as a means to defer or avoid splenectomy.<span class="Sup">42-44</span> In adults, Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> therapy has been shown to be effective in maintaining the platelet count in an acceptable range with or without periodic booster therapy. The mean rise in platelet count was 93,000/µL and the average duration of the increase was 20–24 days.<span class="Sup">39,40</span> However, it should be noted that not all patients will respond. Even in those patients who do respond, this treatment should not be considered to be curative.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF is contraindicated in patients who have had an anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to the administration of human immune globulin. Individuals with IgA deficiency, especially those who have known antibody against IgA, or hypersensitivity to immunoglobulins should only receive Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF with utmost caution due to the risk of severe immediate hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV) products have been reported to be associated with renal dysfunction, acute renal failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death.<span class="Sup">9-14</span></p><p>Patients predisposed to acute renal failure include patients with:</p><p>In such patients, IGIV products should be administered at the minimum concentration available and the minimum rate of infusion practicable. While these reports of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure have been associated with the use of many of the licensed IGIV products, those containing sucrose as a stabilizer accounted for a disproportionate share of the total number. Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF contains sucrose. See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections for important information intended to reduce the risk of acute renal failure.</p><p>IgA deficient patients, especially those with known antibodies against IgA, are at greater risk of developing severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.</p><p>Because Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) agent and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. The risk that such products will transmit an infectious agent has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing for the presence of certain current virus infections, and through the application of viral elimination/reduction steps such as alcohol fractionation in the presence of filter aids, nanofiltration and pH 4/pepsin treatment<span class="Sup">19-21</span> (see Table 1). All infections thought by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF should be reported by lot number, by the physician, or other healthcare provider to CSL Behring Pharmacovigilance at 1-866-915-6958. The physician should discuss the risks and benefits of this product with the patient.</p><p>Patients with agamma- or extreme hypogammaglobulinemia who have never before received immunoglobulin substitution treatment or whose time from last treatment is greater than 8 weeks, may be at risk of developing inflammatory reactions on rapid infusion (greater than 2 mg/kg/min) of Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF. These reactions are manifested by a rise in temperature, chills, nausea, and vomiting. The patient's vital signs should be monitored continuously. The patient should be carefully observed throughout the infusion, since these reactions on rare occasions may lead to shock. Epinephrine and other appropriate resuscitative drugs and equipment should be available for treatment of an acute anaphylactic reaction.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Please see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span> below, for important information on Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF compatibility with other medications or fluids. Patients should not be volume depleted prior to the initiation of the infusion of IGIV. Periodic monitoring of renal function tests and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to have a potential increased risk for developing acute renal failure. Renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, should be assessed prior to the initial infusion of Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF and again at appropriate intervals thereafter. If renal function deteriorates, discontinuation of the product should be considered. For patients judged to be at risk for developing renal dysfunction, Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF should be infused at a rate less than 2 mg/kg/min.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><ul>
<li>Instruct patients to immediately report symptoms of decreased urine output, sudden weight gain, fluid retention/edema, and/or shortness of breath (which may suggest kidney damage) to their physicians.</li>
<li>Instruct patients to immediately report symptoms of thrombosis. These symptoms may include: pain and/or swelling of an arm or leg with warmth over the affected area, discoloration of an arm or leg, unexplained shortness of breath, chest pain or discomfort that worsens on deep breathing, unexplained rapid pulse, numbness or weakness on one side of the body.</li>
</ul><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">IGIV recipients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis. IGIV recipients should be monitored for pulmonary adverse reactions. If Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) is suspected, appropriate tests should be performed for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient serum. Baseline assessment of blood viscosity should be considered in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF. It is also not known whether Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.<span class="Sup">38</span> Intact immune globulins such as those contained in Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF cross the placenta from maternal circulation increasingly after 30 weeks gestation.<span class="Sup">45,46</span> In cases of maternal ITP where Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> was administered to the mother prior to delivery, the platelet response and clinical effect were similar in the mother and neonate.<span class="Sup">38,46-55</span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">High dose administration of Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> in pediatric patients with acute or chronic Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura did not reveal any pediatric-specific hazard.<span class="Sup">29</span> Antibodies in Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) may impair the efficacy of live attenuated viral vaccines such as measles, rubella, and mumps.<span class="Sup">56-58</span> Immunizing physicians should be informed of recent therapy with Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) so that appropriate precautions may be taken.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF should be used with caution in patients over 65 years of age and judged to be at increased risk of developing renal insufficiency (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). In the absence of prospective data, recommended doses should not be exceeded and the concentration and infusion rate selected should be the minimum practicable. The product should be infused at a rate less than 2 mg/kg/min.</p><h3>Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome</h3><p class="First">An aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) has been reported to occur infrequently in association with Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV) treatment. The syndrome usually begins within several hours to two days following IGIV treatment. It is characterized by symptoms and signs including severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, and nausea and vomiting. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis. Patients exhibiting such symptoms and signs should receive a thorough neurological examination, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis. AMS may occur more frequently in association with high dose (2 g/kg) IGIV treatment. Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae.</p><h3>Hemolysis</h3><p class="First">Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV) products can contain blood group antibodies which may act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and, rarely, hemolysis.<span class="Sup">59-61</span> Hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration<span class="Sup">62</span> (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>). IGIV recipients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests</span>).</p><h3>Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) in patients administered IGIV.<span class="Sup">63</span> TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever and typically occurs within 1–6 hours after transfusion. Patients with TRALI may be managed by using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support.</p><p>IVIG recipients should be monitored for pulmonary adverse reactions. If TRALI is suspected, appropriate tests should be performed for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient serum (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests</span>).</p><h3>Thrombosis</h3><p class="First">Thrombosis may occur following treatment with immune globulin products<span class="Sup">1-8</span>, including Carimune NF. Risk factors may include: advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling central vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. Thrombosis may occur in the absence of known risk factors.</p><p>Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies. For patients at risk of thrombosis, administer Carimune NF at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity (see <span class="Bold">BOXED WARNING, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients</span>).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Increases in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been observed as soon as one to two days following infusion. Progression to oliguria or anuria, requiring dialysis has been observed. Types of severe renal adverse events that have been seen following IGIV therapy include: acute renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, proximal tubular nephropathy and osmotic nephrosis.<span class="Sup">9-14,64,71–73</span></p><p>Inflammatory adverse reactions have been described in agammaglobulinemic and hypogammaglobulinemic patients who have never received immunoglobulin substitution therapy before or in patients whose time from last treatment is greater than 8 weeks and whose initial infusion rate exceeds 2 mg/kg/min.</p><p>This occurs in approximately 10% of such cases. Such reactions may also be observed in some patients during chronic substitution therapy.</p><p>Reactions, which may become apparent only 30 minutes to 1 hour after the beginning of the infusion, are as follows: flushing of the face, feelings of tightness in the chest, chills, fever, dizziness, nausea, diaphoresis, and hypotension or hypertension. In such cases, the infusion should be slowed or temporarily stopped until the symptoms subside. The infusion may then be resumed at a lower rate that is comfortable for the patient. If anaphylaxis or other severe reactions occur, the infusion should be stopped immediately.</p><p>Arthralgia, myalgia, and transient skin reactions (such as rash, erythema, pruritus, urticaria, eczema or dermatitis) have also been reported.</p><p>Immediate anaphylactoid and hypersensitivity reactions due to previous sensitization of the recipient to certain antigens, most commonly IgA, may be observed in exceptional cases, described under <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>.<span class="Sup">30,31,65</span> In patients with ITP, who receive higher doses (0.4 g/kg/day or greater), 2.9% of infusions may result in adverse reactions.<span class="Sup">21</span> Headache, generally mild, is the most common symptom noted, occurring during or following 2% of infusions. A few cases of usually mild hemolysis have been reported after infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin products.<span class="Sup">59-61</span> These were attributed to transferal of blood group (e.g., anti-D) antibodies.</p><h3>Postmarketing</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified and reported during the post-approval use of IGIV products:</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Respiratory</span><br/>

Hepatic dysfunction, abdominal pain</p><p>Because postmarketing reporting of these reactions is voluntary and the at-risk populations are of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency of the reaction or establish a causal relationship to exposure to the product. Such is also the case with literature reports authored independently.<span class="Sup">66</span></p><h2>Carimune NF Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">It is generally advisable not to dilute plasma derivatives with other infusable drugs. Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF should be given by a separate infusion line. No other medications or fluids should be mixed with Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF preparation.</p><p>Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency and in patients judged to be at increased risk of developing renal insufficiency (including, but not limited to those with diabetes mellitus, age greater than 65, volume depletion, paraproteinemia, sepsis, and patients receiving known nephrotoxic drugs). In these cases especially it is important to assure that patients are not volume depleted prior to Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF infusion. No prospective data are presently available to identify a maximum safe dose, concentration, and rate of infusion in patients determined to be at increased risk of acute renal failure. In the absence of prospective data, recommended doses should not be exceeded and the concentration and infusion rate selected should be the minimum practicable. For patients judged to be at risk for developing renal dysfunction, Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF should be infused at a rate less than 2 mg/kg/min.</p><p>For patients judged to be at an increased risk for thrombosis, a maximum infusion rate of less than 2 mg/kg/min for patients is recommended (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS: Thrombosis</span>).</p><p>If side effects occur, the infusion should be stopped or slowed until the symptoms subside.</p><h3>Adult and Child Substitution Therapy</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF in primary immunodeficiency is 0.4 to 0.8 g/kg of body weight administered once every three to four weeks by intravenous infusion.</p><p>The first infusion of Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF in previously untreated agammaglobulinemic or hypogammaglobulinemic patients must be given as a 3% immunoglobulin solution (see <span class="Bold">Reconstitution</span>). Subsequent infusions may be administered at a higher concentration if the patient shows good tolerance.</p><p>An initial infusion rate of 0.5 mg/kg/min is recommended. If tolerated, after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 1 mg/kg/min for the next 30 minutes. Thereafter, the rate may be gradually increased in a stepwise manner up to <span class="Bold">a maximum of 3 mg/kg/min</span> as tolerated<span class="Bold">.</span> Refer to Table 3 for the corresponding infusion rates in mg/kg/min or mL/kg/min for all product concentrations.</p><p>The first infusion of Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF in previously untreated agammaglobulinemic and hypogammaglobulinemic patients may lead to systemic side effects. The nature of these effects has not been fully elucidated. Some of them may be due to the release of proinflammatory cytokines by activated macrophages in immunodeficient recipients.<span class="Sup">67,68</span> Subsequent administration of Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF to immunodeficient patients as well as to normal individuals usually does not cause further untoward side effects.</p><h3>Therapy of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF for the treatment of ITP is 0.4 g/kg of body weight on 2–5 consecutive days. An immunoglobulin solution of 6% (see <span class="Bold">Reconstitution</span>) is recommended for use in ITP.</p><p>The recommended initial infusion rate for the treatment of ITP is 0.5 mg/kg/min. If tolerated, after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 1 mg/kg/min for the next 30 minutes. Thereafter, the rate may be gradually increased in a stepwise manner up to <span class="Bold">a maximum of 3 mg/kg/min</span> as tolerated. Refer to Table 3 for the corresponding infusion rates in mg/kg/min or mL/kg/min for all product concentrations.</p><p class="First">In acute ITP of childhood, if an initial platelet count response to the first two doses is adequate (30–50,000/µL), therapy may be discontinued after the second day of the 5 day course.<span class="Sup">35</span></p><p class="First">In adults and children, if after induction therapy the platelet count falls to less than 30,000/µL and/or the patient manifests clinically significant bleeding, 0.4 g/kg of body weight may be given as a single infusion. If an adequate response does not result, the dose can be increased to 0.8–1 g/kg of body weight given as a single infusion.<span class="Sup">36,69,70</span></p><h3>Reconstitution</h3><p class="First">(see also pictures next page)</p><p></p><p>To reconstitute Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF from the individual vial package, or when using other diluents or higher concentrations, Table 4 indicates the volume of sterile diluent required. Observing aseptic technique, this volume should be drawn into a sterile hypodermic syringe and needle. The diluent is then injected into the corresponding Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF vial size.</p><p>If large doses of Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF are to be administered, several reconstituted vials of identical concentration and diluent may be pooled in an empty sterile glass or plastic i.v. infusion container using aseptic technique.</p><p>Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF normally dissolves within a few minutes, though in exceptional cases it may take up to 20 minutes.</p><p><span class="Bold">DO NOT SHAKE! Excessive shaking will cause foaming.</span></p><p>Any undissolved particles should respond to careful rotation of the bottle. Avoid foaming. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Filtering of Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF is acceptable but not required. Pore sizes of 15 microns or larger will be less likely to slow infusion, especially with higher Carimune<span class="Sup">®</span> NF concentrations. Antibacterial filters (0.2 microns) may be used.
