If a patient misses a dose, administer the missed dose as soon as possible, and then resume scheduled treatments every 3 or 4 weeks, as applicable.</p><p>Prior to switching from intravenous to subcutaneous treatment, obtain the patient's serum IgG trough level to guide subsequent dose adjustments. Start the initial subcutaneous dose approximately one week after the last intravenous infusion.</p><p><span class="Italics">Dose Adjustments for Intravenous Administration in MMN</span></p><p>The dose may need to be adjusted to achieve the desired clinical response. In the clinical study, the dose ranged between 0.5 to 2.4 grams/kg/month (See Table 1). While receiving Gammagard Liquid, 9% of subjects in the clinical study experienced neurological decompensation that required an increase in dose. In order to avoid worsening of muscle weakness in patients, dose adjustment may be necessary.</p><p><span class="Italics">Dose Adjustments for Subcutaneous Administration for PI only</span></p><p>Based on the results of clinical studies, the expected increase in serum IgG trough level during weekly subcutaneous treatment at the dose adjusted to provide a comparable AUC, is approximately 281 milligram/dL higher than the last trough level during prior stable intravenous treatment. To calculate the target trough IgG level for subcutaneous treatment, add 281 milligram/dL to the IgG trough level obtained after the last intravenous treatment.</p><p>To guide dose adjustment, calculate the difference between the patient's target serum IgG trough level and the IgG trough level during subcutaneous treatment. Find this difference in the columns of Table 2 and the corresponding amount (in mL) by which to increase (or decrease) the weekly dose based on the patient's body weight. If the difference between measured and target trough levels is less than 100 milligram/dL then no adjustment is necessary. However, the patient's clinical response should be the primary consideration in dose adjustment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Difference between Measured and Target IgG Trough Levels</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Body Weight</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">100 mg/dL</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">200 mg/dL</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">300 mg/dL</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">400 mg/dL</span></p><p class="First">10 kg</p><p class="First">2 mL</p><p class="First">4 mL</p><p class="First">6 mL</p><p class="First">8 mL</p><p class="First">20 kg</p><p class="First">4 mL</p><p class="First">8 mL</p><p class="First">11 mL</p><p class="First">15 mL</p><p class="First">30 kg</p><p class="First">6 mL</p><p class="First">11 mL</p><p class="First">17 mL</p><p class="First">23 mL</p><p class="First">40 kg</p><p class="First">8 mL</p><p class="First">15 mL</p><p class="First">23 mL</p><p class="First">30 mL</p><p class="First">50 kg</p><p class="First">9 mL</p><p class="First">19 mL</p><p class="First">28 mL</p><p class="First">38 mL</p><p class="First">60 kg</p><p class="First">11 mL</p><p class="First">23 mL</p><p class="First">34 mL</p><p class="First">45 mL</p><p class="First">70 kg</p><p class="First">13 mL</p><p class="First">26 mL</p><p class="First">40 mL</p><p class="First">53 mL</p><p class="First">80 kg</p><p class="First">15 mL</p><p class="First">30 mL</p><p class="First">45 mL</p><p class="First">60 mL</p><p class="First">90 kg</p><p class="First">17 mL</p><p class="First">34 mL</p><p class="First">51 mL</p><p class="First">68 mL</p><p class="First">100 kg</p><p class="First">19 mL</p><p class="First">38 mL</p><p class="First">57 mL</p><p class="First">75 mL</p><p class="First">110 kg</p><p class="First">21 mL</p><p class="First">42 mL</p><p class="First">62 mL</p><p class="First">83 mL</p><p class="First">120 kg</p><p class="First">23 mL</p><p class="First">45 mL</p><p class="First">68 mL</p><p class="First">91 mL</p><p class="First">130 kg</p><p class="First">25 mL</p><p class="First">49 mL</p><p class="First">74 mL</p><p class="First">98 mL</p><p class="First">140 kg</p><p class="First">26 mL</p><p class="First">53 mL</p><p class="First">79 mL</p><p class="First">106 mL</p><p>Example 1: A patient with a body weight of 80 kg has a measured IgG trough level of 800 milligram/dL and the target trough level is 1000 milligram/dL.

Certain adverse reactions such as headaches, flushing, and changes in pulse rate and blood pressure may be related to the rate of infusion. Slow or stop infusion if adverse reactions occur. If symptoms subside promptly, the infusion may be resumed at a lower rate that does not result in recurrence of the symptoms.</p><p>Adverse reactions may occur more frequently in patients receiving immune globulin for the first time, upon switching brands or if there has been a long interval since the previous infusion.<span class="Sup">2</span> In such cases, start at lower infusion rates and gradually increase as tolerated.</p><p>Ensure that patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency are not volume depleted. For patients over 65 years of age or judged to be at risk for renal dysfunction or thrombotic events, administer Gammagard Liquid at the minimum infusion rate practicable. In such cases, the maximal rate should be less than 3.3 milligram/kg/min (&lt;2mL/kg/hr); consider discontinuation of administration if renal function deteriorates.

Anaphylaxis has been reported with intravenous use of Gammagard Liquid and is theoretically possible following subcutaneous administration. [See <span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity</span> (5.1)]</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur, even in patients who had tolerated previous treatment with human normal immune globulin. In case of hypersensitivity, discontinue Gammagard Liquid infusion immediately and institute appropriate treatment.</p><p>Gammagard Liquid contains trace amount of IgA (average concentration of 37μg/mL). Patients with antibodies to IgA have a greater risk of developing potentially severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. Gammagard Liquid is contraindicated in patients with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity reaction.<br/>
[S<span class="Italics">ee Contraindications (4)</span>]</p><h3>Renal Dysfunction/Failure</h3><p class="First">Acute renal dysfunction/failure, acute tubular necrosis, proximal tubular nephropathy, osmotic nephrosis, and death may occur upon use of IGIV treatment, especially those containing sucrose<span class="Sup">3</span>. Acute renal dysfunction/failure has been reported in association with infusions of Gammagard Liquid. Assure that patients are not volume depleted prior to the initiation of infusion of Gammagard Liquid. In patients who are at risk of developing renal dysfunction because of pre-existing renal insufficiency or predisposition to acute renal failure (such as diabetes mellitus, age greater than 65, volume depletion, sepsis, paraproteinemia, or patients receiving known nephrotoxic drugs, etc.), administer Gammagard Liquid intravenously at the minimum rate of infusion practicable (not exceeding 3.3 milligram IgG/kg/min (&lt;2 mL/kg/hr). [See <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span></p><p>Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to be at increased risk for developing acute renal failure. Assess renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, before the initial infusion of Gammagard Liquid and again at appropriate intervals thereafter. If renal function deteriorates, consider discontinuation of Gammagard Liquid. [See <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span>]</p><h3>Hyperproteinemia, Increased Serum Viscosity, and Hyponatremia</h3><p class="First">Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity and hyponatremia may occur in patients receiving Gammagard Liquid. It is critical to distinguish true hyponatremia from pseudohyponatremia that is temporally or causally related to hyperproteinemia with concomitant decreased calculated serum osmolality or elevated osmolar gap because treatment aimed at decreasing serum free water in patients with pseudohyponatremia may lead to volume depletion, a further increase in serum viscosity, and a predisposition to thromboembolic events.<span class="Sup">4</span></p><h3>Thrombosis</h3><p class="First">Thrombosis may occur following treatment with immune globulin products, including Gammagard Liquid. Risk factors may include advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling central vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. Thrombosis may occur in the absence of known risk factors.</p><p>Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies. For patients at risk of thrombosis, administer Gammagard Liquid at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity. [See <span class="Italics">Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.3), Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span></p><h3>Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS)</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">AMS may occur with immune globulin treatment, including Gammagard Liquid, administered intravenously or subcutaneously. AMS may occur more frequently in female patients.</span> Discontinuation of immune globulin treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae. The syndrome usually begins within several hours to two days following immune globulin treatment.</p><p>AMS is characterized by the following signs and symptoms: severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, nausea and vomiting. [See <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information</span> (17)] Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies frequently reveal pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per mm<span class="Sup">3</span>, predominantly from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred milligram/dL, but negative culture results. Conduct a thorough neurological examination on patients exhibiting such symptoms and signs, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis.</p><h3>Hemolysis</h3><p class="First">Gammagard Liquid, contains blood group antibodies that may act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells (RBC) with immune globulin. This may cause a positive direct antiglobulin test [DAT (Coomb's test)].<span class="Sup">5,6</span> Delayed hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to Gammagard Liquid therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration; acute hemolysis, consistent with intravascular hemolysis, has been reported. [<span class="Italics">S</span>ee <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span><span class="Sup">5-8</span></p><p>The following risk factors may be related to the development of hemolysis: high doses (e.g., ≥2 grams/kg, single administration or divided over several days) and non-O blood group.<span class="Sup">5</span> Underlying inflammatory state in an individual patient may increase the risk of hemolysis,<span class="Sup">5</span> but its role is uncertain.<span class="Sup">8,9</span></p><p>Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis particularly patients with risk factors noted above. Consider appropriate laboratory testing in higher risk patients, including measurement of hemoglobin or hematocrit prior to infusion and within approximately 36 to 96 hours post infusion. If clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis or a significant drop in hemoglobin or hematocrit have been observed, perform additional confirmatory laboratory testing. If transfusion is indicated for patients who develop hemolysis with clinically compromising anemia after receiving IGIV, perform adequate cross-matching to avoid exacerbating on-going hemolysis. [See <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.9)</span>]</p><h3>Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)</h3><p class="First">Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (TRALI) has been reported in patients following treatment with IGIV products, including Gammagard Liquid. TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever. Symptoms typically occur within 1 to 6 hours after treatment.</p><p>Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions. [S<span class="Italics">ee Patient Counseling Information</span> <span class="Italics">(17)]</span> If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil and anti-HLA antibodies in both the product and patient serum. TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support.</p><h3>Transmittable Infectious Agents</h3><p class="First">Because Gammagard Liquid is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) agent, and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agent. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. No confirmed cases of viral transmission or vCJD have been associated with Gammagard Liquid.</p><p>All infections thought by a physician to possibly have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to Baxalta US Inc., at 1-800-423-2090 (in the U.S.).</p><h3>Monitoring: Laboratory Tests</h3><h3>Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">After infusion of IgG, the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the patient's blood may yield false positive serological testing results, with the potential for misleading interpretation. Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens (e.g., A, B, and D) may cause a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin (Coombs') test.<br/></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Administration of immune globulin products, including Gammagard Liquid, can lead to false positive readings in assays that depend on detection of beta-D-glucans for diagnosis of fungal infections; this may persist during the weeks following infusion of the product.</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PI: Intravenous</span>: The serious adverse reaction seen during intravenous treatment in the clinical studies for PI was aseptic meningitis. The most common adverse reactions for PI (observed in ≥5% of subjects) were headache, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, chills, rigors, pain in extremity, diarrhea, migraine, dizziness, vomiting, cough, urticaria, asthma, pharyngolaryngeal pain, rash, arthralgia, myalgia, oedema peripheral, pruritus, and cardiac murmur.</p><p><span class="Bold">Subcutaneous</span>: No serious adverse reactions were observed during the clinical study of subcutaneous treatment.

Patients at risk of complications of fluid overload and hyperviscosity include elderly patients and those with cardiac or renal impairment.</p><h2>Gammagard Liquid Description</h2><p class="First">Gammagard Liquid is a ready-for-use sterile, liquid preparation of highly purified and concentrated immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. The distribution of the IgG subclasses is similar to that of normal plasma. The Fc and Fab functions are maintained in Gammagard Liquid. Pre-kallikrein activator activity is not detectable. Gammagard Liquid contains 100 milligram/mL protein. At least 98% of the protein is immune globulin, the average immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration is 37 μg/mL, and immunoglobulin M is present in trace amounts. Gammagard Liquid contains a broad spectrum of IgG antibodies against bacterial and viral agents. Glycine (0.25M) serves as a stabilizing and buffering agent. There are no added sugars, sodium or preservatives. The pH is 4.6 to 5.1. The osmolality is 240 to 300 mOsmol/kg, which is similar to physiological osmolality (285 to 295 mOsmol/kg).</p><p>Gammagard Liquid is manufactured from large pools of human plasma. IgG preparations are purified from plasma pools using a modified Cohn-Oncley cold ethanol fractionation process, as well as cation and anion exchange chromatography.</p><p>Screening against potentially infectious agents begins with the donor selection process and continues throughout plasma collection and plasma preparation. Each individual plasma donation used in the manufacture of Gammagard Liquid is collected only at FDA approved blood establishments and is tested by FDA licensed serological tests for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg), and for antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1/HIV-2) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in accordance with U.S. regulatory requirements. As an additional safety measure, mini-pools of the plasma are tested for the presence of HIV-1 and HCV by FDA licensed Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) and found to be negative.</p><p>To further improve the margin of safety, validated virus inactivation/removal steps have been integrated into the manufacturing and formulation processes, namely solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment,<span class="Sup">10</span> 35 nm nanofiltration, and a low pH incubation at elevated temperature (30°C to 32°C). The S/D process includes treatment with an organic mixture of tri-n-butyl phosphate, octoxynol 9 and polysorbate 80 at 18°C to 25°C for a minimum of 60 minutes. S/D treatment inactivates the lipid-enveloped viruses investigated to below detection limits within minutes.<span class="Sup">12</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> virus spiking studies have been used to validate the capability of the manufacturing process to inactivate and remove viruses. To establish the minimum applicable virus clearance capacity of the manufacturing process, virus clearance studies were performed under extreme conditions (e.g., at minimum S/D concentrations, incubation time and temperature for the S/D treatment).</p><p>Virus clearance studies for Gammagard Liquid performed in accordance with good laboratory practices are summarized in Table 8.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Virus type</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Enveloped</span></p><p><span class="Bold">RNA</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Enveloped DNA</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Non-enveloped</span></p><p><span class="Bold">RNA</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Non-enveloped</span></p><p><span class="Bold">DNA</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Family</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Retroviridae</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Flaviviridae</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Herpesviridae</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Picornaviridae</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Parvoviridae</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Virus</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HIV-1</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">BVDV</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WNV</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRV</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HAV</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">EMCV</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">MMV</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">SD treatment</span></p><p class="First">&gt; 4.5</p><p class="First">&gt; 6.2</p><p class="First">n.a.</p><p class="First">&gt; 4.8</p><p class="First">n.d.</p><p class="First">n.d.</p><p class="First">n.d</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">35 nm nanofiltration</span></p><p class="First">&gt; 4.5</p><p class="First">&gt; 5.1</p><p class="First">&gt; 6.2</p><p class="First">&gt; 5.6</p><p class="First">5.7</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">2.0</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Low pH treatment</span></p><p class="First">&gt; 5.8</p><p class="First">&gt; 5.5</p><p class="First">&gt; 6.0</p><p class="First">&gt; 6.5</p><p class="First">n.d.†</p><p class="First">&gt; 6.3</p><p class="First">3.1</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Overall log reduction factor (ORF)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">&gt; 14.8</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">&gt; 16.8</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">&gt; 12.2</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">&gt; 16.9</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">5.7</span>†</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">&gt; 7.7</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">5.1</span></p><h2>Gammagard Liquid - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Gammagard Liquid supplies a broad spectrum of opsonizing and neutralizing IgG antibodies against a wide variety of bacterial and viral agents. Gammagard Liquid also contains a spectrum of antibodies capable of interacting with and altering the activity of cells of the immune system as well as antibodies capable of reacting with cells such as erythrocytes. The role of these antibodies and the mechanism of action of IgG in Gammagard Liquid have not been fully elucidated.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">PI: Intravenous Administration</span></p><p>Following intravenous infusion, IGIV products show a biphasic decay curve. The initial (α) phase is characterized by an immediate post-infusion peak in serum IgG and is followed by rapid decay due to equilibration between the plasma and extravascular fluid compartments. The second (β) phase is characterized by a slower and constant rate of decay. The commonly cited "normal" half-life of 18 to 25 days is based on studies in which tiny quantities of radiolabeled IgG are injected into healthy individuals. When radiolabeled IgG was injected into patients with hypogammaglobulinemia or agammaglobulinemia, highly variable half-lives ranging from 12 to 40 days were observed. In other radiolabeled studies, high serum concentrations of IgG, and hypermetabolism associated with fever and infection, have been seen to coincide with a shortened IgG half-life.</p><p>In contrast, pharmacokinetic studies in immunodeficient patients are based on the decline of IgG concentrations following infusion of large quantities of immune globulin. In such studies, investigators have reported uniformly prolonged half-lives of 26 to 35 days. Pharmacokinetic parameters for Gammagard Liquid were determined from total IgG levels following the fourth infusion in subjects with primary humoral immunodeficiency (N=61) treated intravenously with the product every 3 or 4 weeks according to the regimen used prior to entering the study. Of these, 57 had sufficient pharmacokinetic data to be included in the dataset. The median weight-adjusted dose per subject was 455 milligram/kg/4 weeks with a range of 262 to 710.

[See <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies</span> (14)]</p><p>Subjects were treated intravenously for 12 weeks with Gammagard Liquid and then switched to weekly subcutaneous Gammagard Liquid infusions. Initially, all subjects were treated for a minimum of 12 weeks at a subcutaneous dose that was 130% of the intravenous dose. A comparison of the area under the curve (AUC) for intravenous and subcutaneous infusions done on the first 15 adult subjects determined that the subcutaneous dose required to provide an exposure from subcutaneous administration that was not inferior to the exposure from intravenous administration was 137% of the intravenous dose. Subsequently, all subjects were treated with this dose for 6 weeks after which the dose was individualized for all subjects using IgG trough levels, as described below. After a minimum of 8 weeks at this subcutaneous dose, a PK evaluation was conducted on subjects 12 years of age or older (N=32).</p><p>The mean adjusted dose at the end of the study was 137.3% (125.7 to 150.8) of the intravenous dose for subjects 12 years and older, and 141.0% (100.5 to 160.0) for subjects under the age of 12. Thus, a significant dosing difference was not required for children. At this dose adjustment, the geometric mean ratio of the AUC for subcutaneous vs. intravenous Gammagard Liquid administration was 95.2% (90% confidence limit: 92.3 to 98.2). The peak IgG level occurred 2.9 (1.2 to 3.2) days after subcutaneous administration.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters of Gammagard Liquid administered intravenously <span class="Italics">versus</span> subcutaneously in the clinical study are shown in Table 10. The mean peak IgG level was lower (1393 ± 289 milligram/dL) during subcutaneous treatment than with intravenous treatment (2240 ± 536 milligram/dL), consistent with lower weekly doses compared with doses administered every 3 or 4 weeks intravenously. In contrast, the mean trough level was higher when Gammagard Liquid was given subcutaneously (1202 ± 282 milligram/dL) than when it was given intravenously (1050 ± 260 milligram/dL), a result of both higher monthly dose and more frequent dosing. The median IgG trough level during intravenous treatment in this clinical study, 1010 milligram/dL (95% CI: 940 to 1240), was similar to the median IgG trough level of 1030 milligram/dL (95% CI: 939 to 1110) during intravenous treatment as shown in Table 9.

All subjects were treated for 12 weeks with Gammagard Liquid intravenous infusion every 3 or 4 weeks. Subjects who were on intravenous treatment prior to entering the study were switched to Gammagard Liquid at the same dose and frequency. Subjects who were receiving subcutaneous immune globulin were switched to Gammagard Liquid at the intravenous dose they had received prior to switching to subcutaneous treatment. A PK analysis was performed at the end of the intravenous period in all subjects aged 12 years and older.</p><p>One week after the last intravenous infusion, each subject began subcutaneous treatment with Gammagard Liquid at 130% of the weekly equivalent of the intravenous dose for a minimum of 12 weeks. PK data from the first 15 adult subjects were used to determine the dose required to ensure that the IgG exposure with subcutaneous treatment was not inferior to that with intravenous treatment. The median dose determined from these subjects was 137% of the intravenous dose, and subsequently all subjects were treated for a minimum of 6 weeks at this dose. After 6 subcutaneous infusions, a trough IgG level was obtained and used to individually adapt the subcutaneous dose of Gammagard Liquid to compensate for individual variation from the mean value of 137%. [See <span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.1</span>)]</p><p>All subjects received a minimum of 12 infusions at this individually adapted dose and continued to receive subcutaneous treatment with Gammagard Liquid until the last subject completed the study. Subjects (N=47) were treated with 2,294 subcutaneous infusions of Gammagard Liquid: 4 subjects treated for up to 29 weeks, 17 subjects for 30 to 52 weeks, and 26 subjects for 53 weeks or longer. Two subjects that completed the intravenous treatment part of the study did not continue to the subcutaneous treatment part of the study. The median duration of subcutaneous treatment was 379 days (range: 57 to 477 days).</p><p>Efficacy was determined throughout the entire subcutaneous phase. There were 31 adults aged 16 years or older, 4 adolescents aged 12 to &lt;16 years, and 14 children aged 2 to &lt;12 years. The volume of Gammagard Liquid infused was 30 mL per site for subjects weighing 40 kg and greater, and 20 mL per site for those weighing less than 40 kg. The total weekly dose was divided by those values to determine the number of sites.</p><p>Mean weekly subcutaneous doses ranged from 181.9 milligram/kg to 190.7 milligram/kg (at 130% to 137% of the intravenous dose). In the study, the number of infusion sites per infusion was dependent on the dose of IgG and ranged from 2 to 10. In 75% of infusions, the number of infusion sites was 5 or fewer.</p><p>There were 3 serious validated bacterial infections, all bacterial pneumonia. None of these subjects required hospitalization to treat their infection. The annual rate of acute serious bacterial infections while on Gammagard Liquid subcutaneous treatment was 0.067, with an upper 99% confidence limit of 0.133, which is lower than the minimal goal of achieving a rate of &lt;1 bacterial infection per patient-year.</p><p>Table 13 presents a summary of infections and associated events for subjects during subcutaneous treatment with Gammagard Liquid.

The most common types of PI result in an inability to make a very important type of protein called antibodies, which help the body fight off infections from bacteria or viruses. Gammagard Liquid is made from human plasma that is donated by healthy people. Gammagard Liquid contains antibodies collected from these healthy people that replace the missing antibodies in PI patients.</p><p>MMN is a rare disease that causes muscle weakness that worsens over time. It affects the strength of the lower parts of arms and hands more than the legs, usually without affecting the touch sensation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Who should not use Gammagard Liquid?</span></p><p>Do not use Gammagard Liquid if you have a known history of a severe allergic reaction to immune globulin or other blood products. If you have such a history, discuss this with your healthcare provider to determine if Gammagard Liquid can be given to you. Tell your healthcare provider if you have a condition called selective (or severe) immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency.</p><p><span class="Bold">How should I use Gammagard Liquid?</span></p><p>Gammagard Liquid is given into a vein (intravenously) or under the skin (subcutaneously). For patients with PI, infusions into the vein are usually given every 3 or 4 weeks whereas infusions under the skin are given every week. For patients with MMN, infusions are given into a vein every 2 to 4 weeks as ordered by your physician. You and your healthcare provider will decide which way is best for you. Most of the time infusions under the skin are given at home by patients or caregivers. Although it is possible to give yourself infusions into the vein at home they are more often given in a hospital or infusion center by a nurse.</p><p>Instructions for giving Gammagard Liquid under the skin (subcutaneously) are provided in the Instructions for Use brochure. Only use Gammagard Liquid by yourself after you have been instructed by your healthcare provider.</p><p><span class="Bold">What should I avoid while taking Gammagard Liquid?</span></p><p>Gammagard Liquid can make vaccines (like measles/mumps/rubella or chickenpox vaccines) not work as well for you. Before you get any vaccines, tell your healthcare provider that you take Gammagard Liquid.</p><p>Tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant, or if you are nursing.</p><p><span class="Bold">What are the possible or reasonably likely side effects of Gammagard Liquid?</span></p><p>The following one or more possible reactions may occur at the site of infusion. These generally go away within a few hours, and are less likely after the first few infusions.</p><p>During the infusion of Gammagard Liquid, look out for the first signs of the following common side effects:</p><p>If any of the following problems occur after starting treatment with Gammagard Liquid, stop the infusion immediately and contact your healthcare provider or call emergency services. These could be signs of a serious problem.</p><p>These are not all of the possible side effects with Gammagard Liquid. You can ask your healthcare provider for physician's information leaflet. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.</p><p>Whenever giving yourself treatments at home, you should have another responsible person present to help treat side effects or get help if you have a serious adverse reaction occur. Ask your healthcare provider whether you should have rescue medications, such as antihistamines or epinephrine.</p><p><span class="Bold">How do I store Gammagard Liquid?</span></p><p>Store vials in their original boxes to protect from light.
