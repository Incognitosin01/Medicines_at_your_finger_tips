Organ rejection happens when the immune system treats the new organ as an invader and attacks it.</p><p>Tacrolimus is used together with other medicines to prevent your body from rejecting a heart, liver, or kidney transplant.</p><p>Tacrolimus may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Tacrolimus may increase your risk of developing a serious infection, lymphoma, or other cancers. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of using  tacrolimus.</p><p>Call your doctor right away if you have any signs of infection such as fever, chills, flu symptoms, cough, sweating, painful skin sores, skin warmth or redness, or muscle aches.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use this medicine if you are allergic to tacrolimus or hydrogenated castor oil, or if you have used cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune, Gengraf) within the past 24 hours.</p><p>Using tacrolimus may increase your risk of developing serious infections or certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma or skin cancer. Your risk may be higher if you are treated over long periods of time with drugs that weaken the immune system. Ask your doctor about this risk and about symptoms to watch for.</p><p>Some people taking tacrolimus after a kidney transplant have developed diabetes. This effect has been seen most commonly in people who are Hispanic or African-American.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
