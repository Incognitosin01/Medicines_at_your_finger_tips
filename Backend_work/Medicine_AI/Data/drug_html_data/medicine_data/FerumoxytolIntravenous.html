When the body does not get enough iron, it cannot produce the number of normal red blood cells needed to keep you in good health. This condition is called iron deficiency (iron shortage) or iron deficiency anemia.</p><p>Ferumoxytol is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using ferumoxytol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For ferumoxytol, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to ferumoxytol or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of ferumoxytol injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ferumoxytol injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving ferumoxytol injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of ferumoxytol. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Hypotension (low blood pressure)—Use with caution. May make this condition worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Iron overload—Use is not recommended in patients with this condition.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of ferumoxytol</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you ferumoxytol in a hospital. Ferumoxytol is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. It must be given slowly, so the needle will have to stay in place for at least 15 minutes. Your doctor may need you to stay for at least 30 minutes after receiving the medicine to check for unwanted effects. A second dose will be given 3 to 8 days after your first dose.</p><p>Ferumoxytol comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and understand the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have questions.</p><p>If you are also using cancer medicines, take them at least 30 minutes after receiving ferumoxytol.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using ferumoxytol</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that ferumoxytol is working properly.
