Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal. Monensin medicated cattle and goat feeds are safe for use in cattle and goats only. Consumption by unapproved species may result in toxic reactions. Feeding undiluted or mixing errors resulting in high concentrations of monensin has been fatal to cattle and could be fatal to goats. Must be thoroughly mixed in feeds before use. Do not exceed the levels of monensin recommended in the feeding directions as reduced average daily gains may result. Do not feed to lactating goats. If feed refusals containing monensin are fed to other groups of cattle, the concentration of monensin in the refusals and amount of refusals fed should be taken into consideration to prevent monensin overdosing. A withdrawal time has not been established for pre-ruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.</p><h2>YOU MAY NOTICE:</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>Reduced voluntary feed intake in dairy cows fed monensin. This reduction increases with higher doses of monensin fed. Rule out monensin as the cause of reduced feed intake before attributing to other causes such as illness, feed management, or the environment.</li>
<li>Reduced milk fat percentage in dairy cows fed monensin. This reduction increases with higher doses of monensin fed.</li>
<li>Increased incidence and treatment of cystic ovaries and metritis in dairy cows fed monensin.</li>
<li>Reduced conception rates, increased services per animal, and extended days open and corresponding calving intervals in dairy cows fed monensin.</li>
</ul><p class="First">Have a comprehensive and ongoing nutritional, reproductive and herd health program in place when feeding monensin to dairy cows.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING:</span> When mixing and handling Rumensin 90, use protective clothing, impervious gloves and a dust mask.
