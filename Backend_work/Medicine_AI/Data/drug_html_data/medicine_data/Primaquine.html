Malaria is common in areas such as Africa, South America, and Southern Asia.</p><p>Vivax malaria is a form of malaria in which parasites travel from the bloodstream into other cells and tissues of the body. This can cause a second infection (relapse) to occur.</p><p>Primaquine is used to prevent malaria from coming back in people who have been infected with the vivax form of this disease.</p><p>Primaquine may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use primaquine if you have an autoimmune disorder, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, or if you also use quinacrine (Atabrine).</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use primaquine if you are allergic to it, or if:</p><ul>
