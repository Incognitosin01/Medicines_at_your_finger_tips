Each mL contains the equivalent of 150 mg clindamycin, 0.5 mg disodium edetate and 9.45 mg benzyl alcohol added as preservative in each mL. Clindamycin is a semisynthetic antibiotic produced by a 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of the parent compound lincomycin.</p><p>The chemical name of clindamycin phosphate is L-<span class="Italics">threo</span>-α-D-<span class="Italics">galacto-</span>Octopyranoside, methyl-7-chloro-6,7,8-trideoxy-6-[[(1-methyl-4-propyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)carbonyl] amino]-1-thio-, 2-(dihydrogen phosphate), (2<span class="Italics">S-trans</span>)-.</p><p>The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">34</span>ClN<span class="Sub">2</span>0<span class="Sub">8</span>PS and the molecular weight is 504.96.</p><p>The structural formula is represented below:</p><h2>Clindamycin Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Distribution</h3><p class="First">Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate is converted to active clindamycin. By the end of short-term intravenous infusion, peak serum concentrations of active clindamycin are reached.</p><p>After intramuscular injection of clindamycin phosphate, peak concentrations of active clindamycin are reached within 3 hours in adults and 1 hour in pediatric patients. Serum concentration-time curves may be constructed from IV peak serum concentrations as given in Table 1 by application of elimination half-lives (see <span class="Bold">Excretion</span>).</p><p>Serum concentrations of clindamycin can be maintained above the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations for most indicated organisms by administration of clindamycin phosphate every 8 to 12 hours in adults and every 6 to 8 hours in pediatric patients, or by continuous intravenous infusion. An equilibrium state is reached by the third dose.</p><p>No significant concentrations of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid even in the presence of inflamed meninges.</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p class="First">In vitro studies in human liver and intestinal microsomes indicated that clindamycin is predominantly metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with minor contribution from CYP3A5, to form clindamycin sulfoxide and a minor metabolite, N-desmethylclindamycin.</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p class="First">Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate disappears from the serum with 6 minutes of the average elimination half-life; however, the average serum elimination half-life of active clindamycin is about 3 hours in adults and 2½ hours in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Specific Populations</h3><p class="First">The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules need not be modified in the presence of mild or moderate renal or hepatic disease.</p><p class="First">Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61–79 years) and younger adults (18–39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, the average elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4.0 hours (range 3.4–5.1 h) in the elderly, compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1–4.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function<span class="Sup">1</span>.</p><p class="First">An analysis of pharmacokinetic data in obese pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years and obese adults aged 18 to 20 years demonstrated that clindamycin clearance and volume of distribution, normalized by total body weight, are comparable regardless of obesity.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic.</p><p class="First">Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross-resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B. Macrolide-inducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant isolates of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci should be screened for induction of clindamycin resistance using the D-zone test.</p><p class="First">Clindamycin has been shown to be active against most of the isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span> <span class="Italics">]</span>:</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (methicillin-susceptible strains)<br/>

Its use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or other patients for whom, in the judgment of the physician, a penicillin is inappropriate. Because of the risk of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis, as described in the <span class="Bold">BOXED WARNING</span>, before selecting clindamycin the physician should consider the nature of the infection and the suitability of less toxic alternatives (e.g., erythromycin).</p><p>Bacteriologic studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to clindamycin.</p><p>Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the conditions listed below:</p><p>Lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess caused by anaerobes, <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae,</span> other streptococci (except <span class="Italics">E. faecalis</span>), and <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus.</span></p><p>Skin and skin structure infections caused by <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus</span>, and anaerobes.</p><p>Gynecological infections including endometritis, nongonococcal tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic cellulitis, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection caused by susceptible anaerobes.</p><p>Intra-abdominal infections including peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms.</p><p>Septicemia caused by <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span>, streptococci (except <span class="Italics">Enterococcus faecalis</span>), and susceptible anaerobes.</p><p>Bone and joint infections including acute hematogenous osteomyelitis caused by <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> and as adjunctive therapy in the surgical treatment of chronic bone and joint infections due to susceptible organisms.</p><p>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of clindamycin phosphate and other antibacterial drugs, clindamycin phosphate should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This drug is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to preparations containing clindamycin or lincomycin.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">See <span class="Bold">BOXED WARNING</span>.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin phosphate, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy.

Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Anaphylactic and Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactic reactions have been reported <span class="Bold">(</span>see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS)</span>.</p><p>Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including severe skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), some with fatal outcome, have been reported <span class="Bold">(</span>see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS)</span>.</p><p>In case of such an anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue treatment permanently and institute appropriate therapy.</p><p>A careful inquiry should be made concerning previous sensitivities to drugs and other allergens.</p><h3>Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity in Pediatric Patients ("Gasping Syndrome")</h3><p class="First">This product contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events, including the "gasping syndrome", and death in pediatric patients. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product ordinarily deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the "gasping syndrome", the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known.</p><p>The risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity depends on the quantity administered and the liver and kidneys' capacity to detoxify the chemical. Premature and low birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity.</p><h3>Usage in Meningitis</h3><p class="First">Since clindamycin does not diffuse adequately into the cerebrospinal fluid, the drug should not be used in the treatment of meningitis.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Review of experience to date suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate diarrhea less well. When clindamycin is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for change in bowel frequency.</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate products should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals.</p><p>Certain infections may require incision and drainage or other indicated surgical procedures in addition to antibiotic therapy.</p><p>The use of clindamycin phosphate may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms-particularly yeasts. Should superinfections occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation.</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate should not be injected intravenously undiluted as a bolus, but should be infused over at least 10–60 minutes as directed in the <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span> section.</p><p>Clindamycin dosage modification may not be necessary in patients with renal disease. In patients with moderate to severe liver disease, prolongation of clindamycin half-life has been found. However, it was postulated from studies that when given every eight hours, accumulation should rarely occur. Therefore, dosage modification in patients with liver disease may not be necessary. However, periodic liver enzyme determinations should be made when treating patients with severe liver disease.</p><p>Prescribing clindamycin phosphate in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including clindamycin phosphate should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When clindamycin phosphate is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by clindamycin phosphate or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">During prolonged therapy periodic liver and kidney function tests and blood counts should be performed.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.</p><p>Clindamycin is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5, to the major metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide and minor metabolite N-desmethylclindamycin. Therefore, inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 may increase plasma concentrations of clindamycin and inducers of these isoenzymes may reduce plasma concentrations of clindamycin. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, monitor for loss of effectiveness.</p><p>In vitro studies indicate that clindamycin does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 or CYP2D6 and only moderately inhibits CYP3A4.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long term studies in animals have not been performed with clindamycin to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Genotoxicity tests performed included a rat micronucleus test and an Ames Salmonella reversion test. Both tests were negative.</p><p>Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials with pregnant women, the systemic administration of clindamycin during the second and third trimesters, has not been associated with an increased frequency of congenital abnormalities.</p><p>Clindamycin should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy only if clearly needed. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p>Reproduction studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg/kg/day (2.1 and 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 250 mg/kg/day (0.9 and 0.5 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity.</p><p>Clindamycin Injection contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol can cross the placenta (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS)</span>.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Limited published data based on breast milk sampling reports that clindamycin appears in human breast milk in the range of less than 0.5 to 3.8 mcg/mL at dosages of 150 mg orally to 600 mg intravenously. Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse effects on the breast-fed infant's gastrointestinal flora. If oral or intravenous clindamycin is required by a nursing mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but an alternate drug may be preferred. Monitor the breast-fed infant for possible adverse effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibiotic-associated colitis.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for clindamycin and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from clindamycin or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">When Clindamycin Injection is administered to the pediatric population (birth to 16 years) appropriate monitoring of organ system functions is desirable.</p><h3>Usage in Newborns and Infants</h3><p class="First">This product contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Benzyl alcohol has been associated with a fatal "Gasping Syndrome" in premature infants (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS).</span></p><p>The potential for the toxic effect in the pediatric population from chemicals that may leach from the single dose premixed IV preparation in plastic has not been evaluated (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS)</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of clindamycin did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. However, other reported clinical experience indicates that antibiotic-associated colitis and diarrhea (due to <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>) seen in association with most antibiotics occur more frequently in the elderly (&gt;60 years) and may be more severe. These patients should be carefully monitored for the development of diarrhea.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic studies with clindamycin have shown no clinically important differences between young and elderly subjects with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function after oral or intravenous administration.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following reactions have been reported with the use of clindamycin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Infections and Infestations:</span> <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> colitis</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal:</span> Antibiotic-associated colitis (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>), pseudomembranous colitis, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). An unpleasant or metallic taste has been reported after intravenous administration of the higher doses of clindamycin phosphate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hypersensitivity Reactions:</span> Maculopapular rash and urticaria have been observed during drug therapy. Generalized mild to moderate morbilliform-like skin rashes are the most frequently reported of all adverse reactions.</p><p>Severe skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). Cases of Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), erythema multiforme, some resembling Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been associated with clindamycin. Anaphylactic shock, anaphylactic reaction and hypersensitivity have also been reported (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin and Mucous Membranes:</span> Pruritus, vaginitis, angioedema and rare instances of exfoliative dermatitis have been reported (see <span class="Bold">Hypersensitivity Reactions</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold">Liver:</span> Jaundice and abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed during clindamycin therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal:</span> Although no direct relationship of clindamycin to renal damage has been established, renal dysfunction as evidenced by azotemia, oliguria, and/or proteinuria has been observed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hematopoietic:</span> Transient neutropenia (leukopenia) and eosinophilia have been reported. Reports of agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia have been made. No direct etiologic relationship to concurrent clindamycin therapy could be made in any of the foregoing.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immune System:</span> Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) cases have been reported.</p><p><span class="Bold">Local Reactions:</span> Injection site irritation, pain, induration and sterile abscess have been reported after intramuscular injection and thrombophlebitis after intravenous infusion. Reactions can be minimized or avoided by giving deep intramuscular injections and avoiding prolonged use of indwelling intravenous catheters.</p><p><span class="Bold">Musculoskeletal:</span> Polyarthritis cases have been reported.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular:</span> Cardiopulmonary arrest and hypotension have been reported following too rapid intravenous administration (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Significant mortality was observed in mice at an intravenous dose of 855 mg/kg and in rats at an oral or subcutaneous dose of approximately 2618 mg/kg. In the mice, convulsions and depression were observed.</p><p>Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum.</p><h2>Clindamycin Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">If diarrhea occurs during therapy, this antibiotic should be discontinued (see <span class="Bold">WARNING</span> box).</p><p><span class="Bold">Clindamycin phosphate IM administration should be used undiluted.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Clindamycin phosphate IV administration should be diluted</span> (see <span class="Bold">Dilution for IV use and IV infusion rates</span> below).</p><h3>Adults</h3><p class="First">Serious infections due to aerobic gram-positive cocci and the more susceptible anaerobes (NOT generally including <span class="Italics">Bacteroides fragilis</span>, <span class="Italics">Peptococcus</span> species and <span class="Italics">Clostridium</span> species other than <span class="Italics">Clostridium perfringens</span>):</p><p>600–1200 mg/day in 2, 3 or 4 equal doses.</p><p>More severe infections, particularly those due to proven or suspected <span class="Italics">Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus</span> species, or <span class="Italics">Clostridium</span> species other than <span class="Italics">Clostridium perfringens</span>:</p><p>1200–2700 mg/day in 2, 3 or 4 equal doses.</p><p>For more serious infections, these doses may have to be increased. In life-threatening situations due to either aerobes or anaerobes these doses may be increased. Doses of as much as 4800 mg daily have been given intravenously to adults (see <span class="Bold">Dilution for IV use and IV Infusion Rates</span> section below).</p><p>Single intramuscular injections of greater than 600 mg are not recommended.</p><p>Alternatively, drug may be administered in the form of a single rapid infusion of the first dose followed by continuous IV infusion as follows:</p><h3>Neonates (less than 1 month)</h3><p class="First">15 to 20 mg/kg/day in 3 to 4 equal doses. The lower dosage may be adequate for small prematures.</p><h3>Pediatric patients 1 month of age to 16 years</h3><p class="First">Parenteral (IM or IV) Administration: 20 to 40 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 equal doses. The higher doses would be used for more severe infections. Clindamycin should be dosed based on total body weight regardless of obesity. As an alternative to dosing on a body weight basis, pediatric patients may be dosed on the basis of square meters body surface: 350 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day for serious infections and 450 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day for more severe infections.</p><p>Parenteral therapy may be changed to oral clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride granules or clindamycin hydrochloride capsules when the condition warrants and at the discretion of the physician.</p><p>In cases of β-hemolytic streptococcal infections, treatment should be continued for at least 10 days.</p><h3>Dilution for IV use and IV Infusion Rates</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">The concentration of clindamycin in diluent for infusion should not exceed 18 mg per mL.
