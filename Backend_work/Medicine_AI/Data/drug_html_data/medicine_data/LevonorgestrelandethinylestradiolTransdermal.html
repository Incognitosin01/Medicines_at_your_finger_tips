It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.</p><p>No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective.

Discuss your options for birth control with your doctor.</p><p>Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol will not prevent HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.</p><p>Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
