as fever, depression, or going off feed develop, oral neomycin is not indicated as the sole treatment since<br/>
systemic levels of neomycin are not obtained due to low absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p><span class="Bold">Important</span>: Treatment should continue 24 to 48 hours beyond remission of disease symptoms, but not to<br/>
exceed a total of 14 consecutive days for cattle, swine, sheep, goats, and 5 days for turkeys. Animals not<br/>
