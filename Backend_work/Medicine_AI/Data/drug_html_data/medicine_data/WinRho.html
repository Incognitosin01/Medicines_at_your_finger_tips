</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF, Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), is available as a ready to use solution for injection available in single dose vials of 600 IU (120 mcg), 1,500 IU (300 mcg), 2,500 IU (500 mcg), 5,000 IU (1,000 mcg) and 15,000 IU (3,000 mcg).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF is contraindicated in:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Patients who have had known anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to the administration of human immune globulin products.</li>
<li>IgA-deficient patients with antibodies to IgA or a history of hypersensitivity reaction to WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF or any of its components.</li>
<li>Patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, with pre-existing hemolysis or at high risk for hemolysis.</li>
<li>Infants for the suppression of Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) isoimmunization.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications</span> (4)]. If symptoms of allergic or early signs of hypersensitivity reactions (including generalized urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis) occur, discontinue WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF infusion immediately and institute appropriate treatment. WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF should be administered in a setting where appropriate equipment, medication such as epinephrine, and personnel trained in the management of hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis and shock are available.</p><p>WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF contains ≤ 40 mcg/mL IgA [see <span class="Italics">Description</span> (11)]. Patients with antibodies to IgA have a greater risk of developing potentially severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF is contraindicated in IgA-deficient patients with antibodies to IgA or a history of hypersensitivity reaction to WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF or any of its components [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications</span> (4)].</p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF contains 10% maltose, a disaccharide sugar derived from corn. Patients with corn allergy should avoid using WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF due to risk of hypersensitivity. [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications</span> (4)]</span></span></p><h3>Intravascular Hemolysis (IVH) for ITP Treatment</h3><p class="First">IVH leading to death has been reported in patients treated for ITP with WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF.</p><p>IVH can lead to clinically compromising anemia and multi-system organ failure including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</p><p>Serious complications including severe anemia, acute renal insufficiency, renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) have also been reported.<span class="Sup">7,8</span></p><p>Closely monitor patients treated with WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF for ITP in a healthcare setting for at least 8 hours after administration. Perform a dipstick urinalysis to monitor for hematuria and hemoglobinuria at baseline and then after administration at 2 hours, 4 hours and prior to the end of the monitoring period. Alert patients and monitor for signs and symptoms of IVH including back pain, shaking chills, fever, and discolored urine or hemoglobinuria. Absence of these signs and/or symptoms of IVH within eight hours do not indicate IVH cannot occur subsequently. If signs and/or symptoms of IVH are present or if IVH is suspected after WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF administration, perform post-treatment laboratory tests including plasma hemoglobin, haptoglobin, LDH, and plasma bilirubin (direct and indirect).</p><h3>Hemolysis for ITP Treatment</h3><p class="First">Although the mechanism of action of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF in the treatment of ITP is not completely understood it is postulated that anti-D binds to the Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) RBC resulting in formation of antibody-coated RBC complexes. Immune-mediated clearance of the antibody-coated RBC complexes would spare the antibody-coated platelets because of the preferential destruction of antibody-coated RBC complexes by the macrophages located in the reticuloendothelial system.<span class="Sup">9-11</span> The side effect of this action is a decrease in hemoglobin levels (extravascular hemolysis).<span class="Sup">7</span> The pooled data from ITP clinical studies demonstrated a mean decrease from baseline in hemoglobin levels of 1.2 g/dL within 7 days after administration of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">In patients with pre-disposing conditions, renal and cardiovascular complications of IVH may occur more frequently. Patients of advanced age (age over 65 years) with co-morbid conditions may be at an increased risk of developing sequelae from acute hemolytic reactions. If a patient has evidence of hemolysis (reticulocytosis greater than 3%) or is at high risk for hemolysis [positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) not attributed to previous immune globulin administration], alternate therapies must be used.</span></p><p>If the patient has lower than normal hemoglobin levels (less than 10 g/dL), a reduced dose of 125 to 200 IU/kg (25 to 40 mcg/kg) should be given to minimize the risk of increasing the severity of anemia in the patient. Alternative treatments should be used in patients with hemoglobin levels that are less than 8 g/dL due to the risk of increasing the severity of the anemia [see <span class="Italics">Dose</span> (2.1)].</p><p>Significant anemia may present with pallor, hypotension, or tachycardia while acute renal insufficiency may present with oliguria or anuria, edema and dyspnea. Patients with IVH who develop DIC may exhibit signs and symptoms of increased bruising and prolongation of bleeding time and clotting time which may be difficult to detect in the ITP population. Consequently, the diagnosis of this serious complication of IVH is dependent on laboratory testing [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> (5.9)]. Previous uneventful administration of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF does not preclude the possibility of an occurrence of IVH and its complications following any subsequent administration of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF. Have confirmatory laboratory testing on ITP patients presenting with signs and/or symptoms of IVH and its complications after anti-D administration [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> (5.9)]</p><p>If ITP patients are to be transfused, use Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D)-negative red blood cells (PRBCs) so as not to exacerbate ongoing hemolysis.</p><h3>Transmissible Infectious Agents</h3><p class="First">Because WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF is made from human plasma; it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. The risk of transmitting an infectious agent has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain pathogens, testing for the presence of certain current viral infections, and including virus inactivation/removal steps in the manufacturing process [see <span class="Italics">Description</span> (11)].</p><p>Report all infections thought to have been transmitted by WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF to Saol Therapeutics Inc. at 1-833-644-4216. The physician should discuss the risks and benefits of this product with the patient.</p><h3>Acute Renal Insufficiency/Failure</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Acute renal insufficiency/failure, osmotic nephropathy, acute tubular necrosis, proximal tubular nephropathy, and death may occur upon use of Immune Globulin Intravenous (IGIV) products, including WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF.<span class="Sup">2</span> Ensure that patients are not volume depleted before administering WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF. For patients at risk of renal insufficiency or failure, including those with any degree of pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, advanced age (above 65 years of age), volume depletion, sepsis, paraproteinemia, or receiving known nephrotoxic drugs, administer WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF at the minimum infusion rate practicable and assess renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, before the initial infusion of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF and at appropriate intervals thereafter.</span></p><h3>Thromboembolic Events</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Thromboembolic events may occur during or following treatment with WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF and other IGIV products.<span class="Sup">3,4</span> Patients at risk include those with a history of atherosclerosis, multiple cardiovascular risk factors, advanced age, impaired cardiac output, coagulation disorders, prolonged periods of immobilization, history of arterial or venous thrombosis, estrogen use, indwelling central vascular catheters, and/or known/suspected hyperviscosity. Thrombosis may occur in the absence of known risk factors.</span></p><p>Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies. For patients who are at risk of developing thromboembolic events, administer WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF at the minimum rate of infusion practicable.</p><h3>Interference with Serological Testing</h3><p class="First">After administration of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF, a transitory increase of various passively transferred antibodies in the patient’s blood may yield positive serological testing results, with the potential for misleading interpretation. Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens (e.g., A, B, C and E) and other blood group antibodies [for example, anti Duffy, anti Kidd (anti JKa) antibodies]<span class="Sup">5</span> may cause a positive direct or indirect (Coombs’) test.</p><p>A large fetomaternal hemorrhage late in pregnancy or following delivery may cause a weak mixed field positive D<span class="Sup">u</span> test result. Assess such an individual for a large fetomaternal hemorrhage and adjust the dose of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF accordingly. The presence of passively administered anti Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) in maternal or fetal blood can lead to a positive direct Coombs’ test. If there is an uncertainty about the father’s Rh group or immune status, administer WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF to the mother.</p><h3>Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)</h3><p class="First">Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema may occur in patients following IGIV treatment, including WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF.<span class="Sup">6</span> TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever. Symptoms typically appear within 1 to 6 hours following administration of blood products.</p><p>Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reaction. If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies and anti-HLA antibodies in both the product and patient serum. TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support.</p><h3>Monitoring: Laboratory Tests</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>For all ITP patients, blood type, blood count, reticulocyte count, DAT and dipstick urinalysis are recommended before deciding to treat patients with WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF. In patients with evidence of hemolysis (reticulocytosis greater than 3%), or patients at risk of hemolysis (positive DAT not attributed to previous immune globulin administration) use other treatments.<span class="Sup">1</span></li>
<li>Closely monitor patients administered WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF for at least 8 hours post administration and perform a dipstick urinalysis to monitor for hematuria and hemoglobinuria at baseline and then after administration at 2 hours, 4 hours and prior to the end of the monitoring period.</li>
<li>If signs and/or symptoms of IVH and its complications are present after anti-D administration, perform appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing including, but not limited to, CBC (i.e. hemoglobin, platelet counts), haptoglobin, plasma hemoglobin, urine dipstick, assessment of renal function (i.e. BUN, serum creatinine), liver function (i.e. LDH, direct and indirect bilirubin) and DIC specific tests such as D-dimer or Fibrin Degradation Products (FDP) or Fibrin Split Products (FSP).</li>
<li>Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output in patients who are at increased risk of developing acute renal failure [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> (5.5)]. Assess renal function in these at-risk patients, including measurement of BUN and serum creatinine, before the initial infusion of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF and at appropriate intervals thereafter.</li>
<li>If TRALI is suspected in ITP patients, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient serum [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> (5.9)].</li>
</ul><h3>Interference with Blood Glucose Testing: False High Blood Glucose Levels</h3><p class="First">The liquid formulation of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF contains maltose. Maltose in IGIV products has been shown to give falsely high blood glucose levels in certain types of blood glucose testing systems [for example, by systems based on glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinolinequinone (GDH-PQQ) or glucose-dye-oxidoreductase methods]. Due to the potential for falsely elevated glucose readings, only use testing systems that are glucose-specific to test or monitor blood glucose levels in patients receiving maltose-containing parenteral products, including WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF Liquid.</p><p>Carefully review the product information of the blood glucose testing system, including that of the test strips, to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral products. If any uncertainty exists, contact the manufacturer of the testing system to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral products.</p><h3>Suppression of Rh Isoimmunization</h3><p class="First">Do not administer WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF to Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D)-negative individuals who are Rh immunized as evidenced by an indirect antiglobulin (Coombs’) test revealing the presence of anti-Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) (anti-D) antibody. For postpartum use following an Rh-incompatible pregnancy administer WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF to the mother only. Do not administer to the newborn infant.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Serious adverse reactions, some of these cases resulted in fatal outcome, have been observed in patients receiving WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF for the treatment of ITP. These include: intravascular hemolysis (IVH), clinically compromising anemia, acute renal insufficiency and DIC [see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions</span>, (6.2)].</p><p>The most common adverse reactions observed for <span class="Bold Underline">all</span> indications are: headache, chills, fever, asthenia, pallor, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, dizziness, hyperkinesia, abdominal or back pain, hypotension, hypertension, increased LDH, somnolence, vasodilation, pruritus, rash and sweating. All adverse reactions listed occurred in ≤ 2% of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF doses administered in clinical trials.</p><p>Adverse reactions observed in the use of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF for Suppression of Rh Isoimmunization are &lt; 0.1% in Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D)-negative individuals.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experiences</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under different protocols and widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a specific drug product cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment of ITP</span></p><p>The safety of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF was evaluated in clinical trials (n=161) in children and adults with acute and chronic ITP and adults and children with ITP secondary to HIV. Overall, 417 adverse events were reported by 91 patients (57%). The most common adverse events were headache (14% of the patients), fever (11% of the patients) and asthenia (11% of the patients). A total of 117 adverse drug reactions were reported by 46 patients (29%). Headache, chills, and fever were the most common related adverse events (Table 5). With respect to safety profile per administration, 60/848 (7%) of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF infusions had at least one adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions were headache (19 infusions; 2%), chills (14 infusions; &lt; 2%), and fever (9 infusions; 1%).</p><p>In four clinical trials of patients treated with the recommended initial intravenous dose of 250 IU/kg (50 mcg/kg), the mean maximum decrease in hemoglobin was 1.70 g/dL (range: +0.40 to -6.1 g/dL). At a reduced dose, ranging from 125 to 200 IU/kg (25 to 40 mcg/kg), the mean maximum decrease in hemoglobin was 0.81 g/dL (range: +0.65 to -1.9 g/dL). Only 5/137 (3.7%) of patients had a maximum decrease in hemoglobin of greater than 4 g/dL (range: -4.2 to -6.1 g/dL).</p><p><span class="Bold">Suppression of Rh Isoimmunization</span></p><p>In the clinical trial of 1,186 Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D)-negative pregnant women, no adverse reactions were reported to Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) IGIV.</p><h3>Post-marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions listed by body system have been identified during the post-approval use of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF.

Passive transfer of antibodies may transiently impair the immune response to live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (see <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information</span> [17.1]). Do not give immunization with live vaccines within 3 months after WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF administration.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>For the treatment of ITP, there is no human data or animal data available to establish the presence or absence of drug-associated risk.</p><p>When administered to pregnant women in a clinical trial to evaluate WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF for suppression of Rh isoimmunization [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies</span> (14.2)] following dosing regimens similar to Table 2 [see <span class="Italics">Dosing and Administration</span> (2.1)], WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF was not shown to harm the fetus or newborn.<span class="Sup">12</span></p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF in human milk, the effect on the breastfed infant, and the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF has been evaluated for the treatment of chronic or acute ITP in children and in children (&lt;16 years of age) with ITP secondary to HIV infection [see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions</span> (6.2)]. The dosing recommendation in the treatment of children with ITP is the same as in adults [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration</span> (2.1)].</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Post marketing clinical experience suggests that patients of advanced age (age over 65) with co-morbid conditions including but not limited to cardio-respiratory decompensation, renal failure or insufficiency or prothrombotic conditions are at increased risk of developing serious complications from acute hemolytic reactions such as IVH. Patients receiving doses in excess of 300 IU/kg of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF may also be at an increased risk of developing increased hemolysis. Fatal outcomes associated with IVH and its complications have occurred most frequently in patients of advanced age (age over 65) with co-morbid conditions.</p><p>Given the prevalence of co-morbid conditions and concomitant drug therapy in geriatric patients, consider starting at the low end of the dosing range when using WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF in this population.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment of ITP and Suppression of Rh Isoimmunization</span></p><p>In post-marketing spontaneous reporting, there has been a limited number of medication error reports related to dosage calculations in which higher doses than that recommended for WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF were administered (doses &gt; 60 mcg/kg). Signs and laboratory findings of overdosage in Rh positive (ITP) patients have included hemoglobin decreases in excess of 1.2 g/dL. For the suppression of Rh isoimmunization, hemolytic reactions have been reported in cases of mis-matched blood transfusions where very large doses of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF were administered.</p><p>In one ITP case report that involved an overdose due to confusion between mcg and international unit (IU), a patient with significant co-morbidities developed IVH and had a fatal outcome. In the event of overdose, monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of hemolysis and initiate symptomatic and supportive treatment.</p><h2>WinRho Description</h2><p class="First">WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF is a sterile, liquid gamma globulin (IgG) fraction containing antibodies to the Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) antigen (D antigen). WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF is to be administered intravenously for the treatment of ITP and either intravenously or intramuscularly for the suppression of Rh isoimmunization.</p><p>WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF is prepared from human plasma by an anion-exchange column chromatography method. The manufacturing process includes two steps implemented specifically for viral clearance. The solvent detergent treatment step (using tri-n-butyl phosphate and octoxynol) is effective in inactivating lipid enveloped viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. Virus filtration, using a 20N virus filter, is effective in the removal of some non-lipid enveloped viruses. These two processes are designed to increase product safety by reducing the risk of transmission of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, respectively. In addition to the two specific steps, the anion-exchange chromatography step contributes to the removal of small non-lipid enveloped viruses.</p><p>The inactivation and reduction of known enveloped and non-enveloped model viruses were validated in laboratory studies as summarized in Table 6.</p><p class="First Footnote">* The PRV was retained by the 0.1 µm pre-filter during the virus validation. Since manufacturing employs a 0.1 µm pre-filter before the 20N filter, the claim of ≥5.6 reduction is considered applicable.</p><p class="Footnote">Abbreviations:</p><p class="Footnote">HIV-1: human immunodeficiency virus-1; relevant virus for human immunodeficiency virus-1 and model for HIV-2.</p><p class="Footnote">BVDV: bovine viral diarrhea virus; model virus for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and West Nile virus (WNV)</p><p class="Footnote">PRV: pseudorabies virus; model for large enveloped DNA viruses, including herpes</p><p class="Footnote">HAV: human hepatitis A virus; relevant virus for HAV and model for small non-enveloped viruses in general</p><p class="Footnote">EMC: encephalomyocarditis virus; model for HAV and for small non-enveloped viruses in general</p><p class="Footnote">MMV: murine minute virus; model for human parvovirus B19 and for small non-enveloped viruses in general</p><p class="Footnote">PPV: porcine parvovirus; model for human parvovirus B19 and for small non-enveloped viruses in general</p><p class="Footnote">n.e.: not evaluated</p><p>The product potency is expressed in international units (IU) by comparison to the World Health Organization (WHO) standard. In the past, a full dose of Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) Immune Globulin (Human) has traditionally been referred to as a “300 microgram (mcg)” dose. Potency and dosing recommendations are now expressed in IU by comparison to the WHO anti-Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) standard. The conversion of mcg to IU is: 1 mcg = 5 IU. A 1,500 IU (300 mcg) vial contains sufficient anti-Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) to effectively suppress the immunizing potential of approximately 17 mL of Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) (D-positive) RBCs.</p><p>The liquid formulation is stabilized with 10% maltose and 0.03% polysorbate 80.

Platelet counts usually rise within one to two days and peak within seven to 14 days after initiation of therapy. The mechanism of action is not completely understood, but is thought to be due to the formation of anti-Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D)-coated RBC complexes, which are preferentially removed by the reticuloendothelial system, particularly the spleen. This results in Fc receptor blockade, thus sparing antibody-coated platelets.<span class="Sup">9,10</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Suppression of Rh Isoimmunization</span></p><p>The mechanism by which Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) immune globulin suppresses immunization to Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D)-positive RBCs is not completely understood.</p><p>WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF when administered within 72 hours of a full-term delivery of a Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D)-positive infant by a Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) negative mother will reduce the incidence of Rh isoimmunization from 12-13% to 1-2%. The 1-2% is, for the most part, due to isoimmunization during the last trimester of pregnancy. When treatment is given both antenatally, at 28-weeks gestation, and postpartum, the Rh immunization rate drops to about 0.1%.<span class="Sup">13,14</span></p><p>When 600 IU (120 mcg) of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF is administered to pregnant women, passive anti-Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) antibodies are not detectable in the circulation for more than six weeks and therefore a dose of 1,500 IU (300 mcg) should be used for antenatal administration.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In a clinical study with Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D)-negative volunteers (nine males and one female), Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D)-positive RBCs were completely cleared from the circulation within 8 hours of intravenous administration of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF. There was no indication of Rh isoimmunization of these subjects at six months after the clearance of the Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D)-positive RBCs.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">IM versus IV Administration (Lyophilized Powder)</span></p><p>In a clinical study involving Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D)-negative volunteers, two subjects received 600 IU (120 mcg) WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF by intravenous (IV) administration and two subjects received this dose by intramuscular (IM) administration. Peak levels (36 to 48 ng/mL) were reached within two hours of IV administration and peak levels (18 to 19 ng/mL) were reached at five to 10 days after IM administration. Although no statistical comparisons were made, the calculated areas under the curve were comparable for both routes of administration. The t<span class="Sub">½</span> for anti-Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) was about 24 days following IV administration and about 30 days following IM administration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Lyophilized Powder versus Liquid Formulation</span></p><p>In two comparative pharmacokinetics studies, 101 volunteers were administered the liquid or lyophilized formulation of WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF intravenously (n=41) or intramuscularly (n=60). The formulations were bioequivalent following IV administration based on area under the curve to 84 days and had comparable pharmacokinetics following IM administration. The average peak concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of anti-Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D) for both formulations were comparable following IV or IM administration and occurred within 30 minutes or 2-4 days of administration, respectively. Both formulations also had similar elimination half-lives (t<span class="Sub">½</span>) following IV or IM administration.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Treatment of ITP</h3><p class="First">Efficacy was documented in four subgroups of patients with ITP:</p><p><span class="Bold">Childhood Chronic ITP</span></p><p>In an open-label, single arm, multicenter study, 24 non-splenectomized, Rh<span class="Sub">o</span>(D)-positive children with ITP of greater than six-months duration were treated initially with 250 IU/kg (50 mcg/kg) WinRho<span class="Sup">®</span> SDF [125 IU/kg (25 mcg/kg) on days 1 and 2, with subsequent doses ranging from 125 to 275 IU/kg (25 to 55 mcg/kg)].
