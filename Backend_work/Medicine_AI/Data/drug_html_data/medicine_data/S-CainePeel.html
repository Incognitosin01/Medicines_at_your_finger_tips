</ul><h2>Treatment for: <i>Topical Local Anesthesia</i></h2><p><b>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a topical local anesthetic peel developed under the name of S-Caine Peel (Lidocaine and Tetracaine) 7%/7% Cream.</b></p><p>The approved product will be used to locally anesthetize intact skin before various superficial dermatological procedures such as dermal filler procedures, pulsed dye laser therapy, facial laser resurfacing, and laser- assisted tattoo removal. The product is indicated for use in adults.</p><p>The Lidocaine and Tetracaine 7%/7% Cream is a topical local anesthetic cream that forms a pliable peel on the skin when exposed to air. The approved product is applied for 20-30 minutes prior to procedures such as dermal filler injections or facial laser ablation, and for 60 minutes for procedures such as laser-assisted tattoo removal.</p><p>Robert Lippert, President and Chief Executive Office of ZARS Pharma, stated, "We are thrilled with the FDA approval. This product will provide physicians with a new option in reducing patients' pain associated with common cosmetic and aesthetic procedures. I am also very proud of the ZARS organization since this approval represents the second NDA approval in the last 12 months."</p><p>In clinical trials, the most common side effects were local skin reactions, such as erythema, blanching and edema. The Lidocaine and Tetracaine 7%/7% Cream should not be used for a duration longer than recommended, and is contraindicated in patients with a known history of sensitivity to lidocaine, tetracaine, or local anesthetics of the amide or ester type. The FDA has not approved a proprietary name yet; a proprietary name will have to receive FDA approval prior to the U.S. launch of the product.</p><h2>More about S-Caine Peel (lidocaine / tetracaine topical)</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
