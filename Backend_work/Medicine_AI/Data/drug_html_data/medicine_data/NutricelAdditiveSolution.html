Use only if solutions are clear. If preparing a platelet concentrate, the platelet-rich plasma should be separated from the red blood cells within 8 hours after blood collection. If preparing fresh frozen plasma, separate from the red blood cells and place in the freezer at -18 °C or colder within 8 hours after collection.</p><p>* During processing, always observe the following precautions:</p><p>1. Sealing should be done in a manner that avoids fluid splatter.</p><p>2. Always dispose of blood-contaminated products in a manner consistent with established BIOHAZARD safety procedures.</p><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Store CP2D/AS-3 preserved red blood cells at 1—6 °C for up to 42 days and use as indicated.</p><h2>I. BLOOD COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR SYSTEMS CONTAINING A Y SAMPLING SITE(YSS) ONLY</h2><p class="First">1. Load blood agitation device or suspend blood bag on donor scale and adjust donor scale to desired collection gross weight as per manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>2. Clamp donor tubing between DonorCare® Needle Guard (DCNG) and Y Sampling Site.</p><p>3. Secure donor tubing above the Y connector and disinfect site of phlebotomy.</p><p>4. If using blood pressure cuff, inflate to not more than 60 mm Hg.</p><p>5. Remove donor needle cover and accomplish phlebotomy.</p><p>6. Release clamp and ensure there is blood flow. Reduce pressure as required.</p><p>7. Slide the DCNG midway over the needle hub and securely tape DCNG to the donor's arm as close to the top of the DCNG as possible. Note: If blood flow is slow, slide DCNG away from the needle hub, adjust and re-engage DCNG. If repeated needle adjustment is necessary, slide DCNG away from the needle hub and re-engage at the end of blood collection.</p><p>8. Collect appropriate volume of blood into collection bag, as indicated on packaging.</p><p>Note: Mix blood and anticoagulant frequently during collection, for example, once every 45 seconds, and immediately after collection. If blood agitation device is used, follow manufacturer's operating instructions.</p><p>9. After required amount of blood has been collected, seal donor tubing close to Y Sampling Site.*</p><p>10. For blood sampling, remove the Y Sampling Site needle cover. Ensure the protective sheath is in place over the sampling needle.</p><p>11. Fasten the vacuum tube holder on to the base of the sampling needle.</p><p>12. Collect blood samples into vacuum tubes.</p><p>13. Ensure the vacuum tubes are centered within the vacuum tube holder during sample collection.</p><p>14. Maintain forward pressure on the vacuum tubes during sample collection. Note: After the last tube is collected, it is recommended that the vacuum tube holder be left in place.</p><p>15. After blood samples are collected, clamp donor tubing between the Y Sampling Site and DCNG, and as close to the DCNG as possible.</p><p>16. Release any remaining pressure from the donor's arm.</p><p>17. DCNG must be held stationary while the needle is withdrawn into it. While holding sides of DCNG near the front, grasp the tubing below the clamp and pull the needle into the DCNG until it locks into place, and the needle hub engages the bottom of the DCNG.</p><p>18.
