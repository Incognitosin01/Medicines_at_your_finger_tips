This condition occurs in such diseases as dermatomyositis, morphea, Peyronie's disease, scleroderma, and linear scleroderma.</p><p>Aminobenzoate potassium is also used to treat a certain type of inflammation (nonsuppurative inflammation) that occurs in such diseases as dermatomyositis, pemphigus, and Peyronie's disease.</p><p>Aminobenzoate potassium is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using aminobenzoate potassium</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For aminobenzoate potassium, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to aminobenzoate potassium or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Although there is no specific information comparing use of aminobenzoate potassium in children with use in other age groups, aminobenzoate potassium is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Elderly people may be more sensitive to certain symptoms of the low blood sugar side effect. These symptoms include confusion, difficulty in concentration, and headache. In addition, these symptoms may be harder to detect in elderly persons than in younger adults. This may increase the chance of problems during treatment with aminobenzoate potassium.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of aminobenzoate potassium. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes) or</li>
<li>Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)—The risk of the medicine causing hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) may be increased</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Kidney disease—Aminobenzoate potassium is removed from the body by the kidneys; higher blood levels of the medicine may occur if kidney disease is present, which may increase the chance of side effects</li>
