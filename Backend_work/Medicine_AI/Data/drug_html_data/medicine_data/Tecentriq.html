Atezolizumab strengthens your immune system to help your body fight against tumor cells.</p><p>Tecentriq is used to treat adults with:</p><ul>
<li>a type of cancer of the bladder and urinary tract called urothelial carcinoma</li>
<li>a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)</li>
<li>a type of breast cancer called triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)</li>
<li>a type of lung cancer called small cell lung cancer (SCLC)</li>
<li>a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)</li>
<li>a type of skin cancer called melanoma.</li>
</ul><p>Tecentriq is used when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic), or cannot be removed by surgery.</p><p>Your doctor may perform a biopsy to test your cancer for a protein called "PD-L1," or a specific genetic marker (an abnormal "EGFR" or "ALK" or "BRAF" gene).</p><p>Tecentriq is sometimes given after other cancer treatments have not worked or have stopped working. Tecentriq may be given in combination with chemotherapy medicines.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Tecentriq affects your immune system and may cause it to attack normal healthy tissues or organs, leading to serious or life-threatening medical problems.</p><p><b>Call your doctor at once if you have new or worsening symptoms such as:</b> chest pain, cough, breathing problems, stomach pain, vomiting, changes in appetite or weight, increased thirst or urination, headaches, neck stiffness, vision problems, tiredness, mood changes, muscle weakness, bleeding or bruising, bloody or tarry stools, dark urine, or yellowing of the skin or eyes.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Tecentriq if you are allergic to atezolizumab.</p><p>To make sure Tecentriq is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>

A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>This medicine must be given slowly, and the infusion can take up to 60 minutes to complete.</p><p>If you receive Tecentriq to treat a type of skin cancer called melanoma, you will also be given two other medications to take by mouth. <b>Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully.</b></p><p>You may be given other medications to help treat certain serious side effects. Keep using these medicines for as long as your doctor has prescribed.</p><p>Tecentriq helps your immune system fight against tumor cells, but your immune system may attack normal healthy tissues or organs.
