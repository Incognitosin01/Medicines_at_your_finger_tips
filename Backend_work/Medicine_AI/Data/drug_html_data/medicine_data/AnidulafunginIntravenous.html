It is used to treat fungal infections including candidemia (fungal infection in the blood), candida peritonitis and abscess (fungal infection in the stomach), esophageal candidiasis (fungal infection in the esophagus), and other fungal infections (including infections in the stomach).</p><p>Anidulafungin is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using anidulafungin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For anidulafungin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to anidulafungin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of anidulafungin injection in children younger than 1 month of age with candidemia or candida peritonitis and abscess. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of anidulafungin injection in children with esophageal candidiasis. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of anidulafungin injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of anidulafungin than younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of anidulafungin. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Allergies to other echinocandin antifungal drugs (eg, caspofungin [Cancidas®], micafungin [Mycamine®])—Should not be used in patients with this condition.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Fructose intolerance (rare hereditary problem)—Should not be used in patients with this condition.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Liver disease—Use with caution. May make this condition worse.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of anidulafungin</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you anidulafungin. Anidulafungin is given through a needle placed in one of your veins. Anidulafungin is given slowly, so the needle will have to remain in place for 45 minutes to 3 hours.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using anidulafungin</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check you closely while you are receiving anidulafungin</i>. This is to make sure the medicine has worked properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, unusual tiredness or weakness, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.</p><p>Anidulafungin may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after receiving anidulafungin.</p><p>Anidulafungin contains polysorbate 80, which can increase the risk for polysorbate toxicity in low-birth weight infants. Talk with your doctor if you have any concerns about this.</p><p>It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Anidulafungin side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
