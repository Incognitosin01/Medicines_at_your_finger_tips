Folic Acid is contraindicated in patients with untreated and uncomplicated pernicious anemia, and in those with anaphylactic sensitivity to folic acid. Cyanocobalamin is contraindicated in patients with sensitivity to cobalt or to cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12).</p><p class="First">Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</p><h2>WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS</h2><p class="First">High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased risk of heart disease can occur. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency.</p><p>Avoid Over dosage. Keep out of the reach of children.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">As little as 5 mg pyridoxine daily can decrease the efficacy of levodopa in the treatment of Parkinsonism. Therefore, STROVITE® FORTE is not recommended for patients undergoing such therapy.</p><p>High doses of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of anticonvulsant drugs.</p><p>Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with large amounts of calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calciumcontaining kidney stones.</p><p>Zinc can inhibit the absorption of certain antibiotics; take at least 2 hours apart to minimize interactions.</p><p>Consult appropriate references for additional specific vitamin-drug interactions.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients should be counseled to disclose all medical conditions, including use of all medications, vitamins and supplements, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Not recommended for pediatric use.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions have been reported with specific vitamins and minerals, but generally at levels substantially higher than those in STROVITE<span class="Sup">®</span> FORTE. However, allergic and idiosyncratic reactions are possible at lower levels. Iron, even at the usual recommended levels, has been associated with gastrointestinal intolerance in some patients.</p><h2>Strovite Forte Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Usual adult dosage: one caplet daily.</p><h2>How is Strovite Forte Supplied</h2><p class="First">Dark green, oblong, bisect caplets; embossed "EV 0204".
