</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for this Medicine</h2><p>In November 2000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public health warning regarding phenylpropanolamine (PPA) due to the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. The FDA, supported by results of a research program, requested that manufacturers voluntarily discontinue marketing products that contain PPA and that consumers work with their healthcare providers to select alternative products.</p><p>Antihistamine and decongestant combinations are used to treat the nasal congestion (stuffy nose), sneezing, and runny nose caused by colds and hay fever.</p><p>Antihistamines work by preventing the effects of a substance called histamine, which is produced by the body. Histamine can cause itching, sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes. Antihistamines contained in these combinations are:</p><ul>
<li>acrivastine, azatadine, brompheniramine, carbinoxamine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, dexbrompheniramine, diphenhydramine, loratadine, pheniramine, phenyltoloxamine, promethazine, pyrilamine, and triprolidine.</li>
</ul><p>The decongestants, such as phenylephrine, and pseudoephedrine, produce a narrowing of blood vessels. This leads to clearing of nasal congestion, but it may also cause an increase in blood pressure in patients who have high blood pressure.</p><p>Some of these combinations are available only with your doctor's prescription. Others are available without a prescription; however, your doctor may have special instructions on the proper dose of the medicine for your medical condition.</p><p><i>Do not give any over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicine to a baby or child under 2 years of age.</i> Using these medicines in very young children might cause serious or possibly life-threatening side effects .</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using this Medicine</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Very young children are usually more sensitive to the effects of this medicine. Increases in blood pressure, nightmares or unusual excitement, nervousness, restlessness, or irritability may be more likely to occur in children. <i>Before giving any of these combination medicines to a child, check the package label very carefully. Some of these medicines are too strong for use in children</i>. If you are not certain whether a specific product can be given to a child, or if you have any questions about the amount to give, check with your health care professional.</p><p><i>Do not give any over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicine to a baby or child under 2 years of age.</i> Using these medicines in very young children might cause serious or possibly life-threatening side effects .</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Confusion, difficult and painful urination, dizziness, drowsiness, dryness of mouth, or convulsions (seizures) may be more likely to occur in the elderly, who are usually more sensitive to the effects of this medicine. Also, nightmares or unusual excitement, nervousness, restlessness, or irritability may be more likely to occur in elderly patients.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>The occasional use of antihistamine and decongestant combinations is not likely to cause problems in the fetus or in the newborn baby. However, when these medicines are used at higher doses and/or for a long time, the chance that problems might occur may increase. For the individual ingredients of these combinations, the following apply:</p><ul>
<li>Alcohol—Some of these combination medicines contain alcohol. Too much use of alcohol during pregnancy may cause birth defects.</li>
<li>Phenylephrine—Studies on birth defects have not been done in either humans or animals with phenylephrine.</li>
<li>Promethazine—Phenothiazines, such as promethazine (contained in some of these combination medicines [e.g., Phenergan-D]), have been shown to cause jaundice and muscle tremors in a few newborn infants whose mothers received phenothiazines during pregnancy. Also, the newborn baby may have blood clotting problems if promethazine is taken by the mother within 2 weeks before delivery.</li>
<li>Pseudoephedrine—Studies on birth defects with pseudoephedrine have not been done in humans. In animal studies pseudoephedrine did not cause birth defects but did cause a decrease in average weight, length, and rate of bone formation in the animal fetus when administered in high doses.</li>
</ul><h3>Breast Feeding</h3><p>Small amounts of antihistamines and decongestants pass into the breast milk. Use is not recommended since the chances are greater for this medicine to cause side effects, such as unusual excitement or irritability, in the nursing baby. Also, since antihistamines tend to decrease the secretions of the body, it is possible that the flow of breast milk may be reduced in some patients. It is not known yet whether loratadine causes these same side effects.</p><h3>Interactions with Medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with a medication in this class or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>

The results of the test may be affected by the antihistamine in this medicine.</p><p>When taking antihistamines (contained in this combination medicine) on a regular basis, make sure your doctor knows if you are taking large amounts of aspirin at the same time (as for arthritis or rheumatism). Effects of too much aspirin, such as ringing in the ears, may be covered up by the antihistamine.</p><p>The antihistamine in this medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that slow down the nervous system, possibly causing drowsiness). Some examples of CNS depressants are other antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds; sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine; prescription pain medicine or narcotics; barbiturates; medicine for seizures; muscle relaxants; or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. <i>Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are taking this medicine</i>.</p><p>The antihistamine in this medicine may cause some people to become drowsy, dizzy, or less alert than they are normally. <i>Some antihistamines are more likely to cause drowsiness than others (loratadine , for example, rarely produces this effect). Make sure you know how you react before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or are not alert</i>.</p><p>The decongestant in this medicine may add to the central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and other effects of diet aids. <i>Do not use medicines for diet or appetite control while taking this medicine unless you have checked with your doctor</i></p><p>The decongestant in this medicine may cause some people to be nervous or restless or to have trouble in sleeping. If you have trouble in sleeping, <i>take the last dose of this medicine for each day a few hours before bedtime</i>. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.</p><p>Antihistamines may cause dryness of the mouth, nose, and throat. Some antihistamines are more likely to cause dryness of the mouth than others (loratadine , for example, rarely produces this effect). For temporary relief, use sugarless candy or gum, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. However, if your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.</p><p>For patients <i>using promethazine-containing medicine</i>:</p><ul>
<li>This medicine controls nausea and vomiting. For this reason, it may cover up the signs of overdose caused by other medicines or the symptoms of intestinal blockage. This will make it difficult for your doctor to diagnose these conditions. Make sure your doctor knows that you are taking this medicine if you have other symptoms such as stomach or lower abdominal pain, cramping, or soreness. Also, if you think you may have taken an overdose of any medicine, tell your doctor that you are taking this medicine.</li>
