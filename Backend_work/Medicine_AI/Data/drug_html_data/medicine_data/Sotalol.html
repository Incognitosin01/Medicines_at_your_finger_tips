Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Sotalol oral is taken by mouth. Sotalol injection is given as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give you this injection if you are unable to take the medicine by mouth.</p><p>You will receive your first few doses of sotalol in a hospital setting where your heart can be monitored in case the medicine causes serious side effects.</p><p>If you already take heart rhythm medication, you may need to stop taking it when you start using sotalol. Carefully follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Measure liquid medicine carefully. Use the dosing syringe provided, or use a medicine dose-measuring device (not a kitchen spoon).</p><p>Sotalol doses are based on age and body surface area (height and weight) in children. Your child's dose needs may change if the child gains or loses weight, or is still growing.</p><p>Call your doctor if you are sick with vomiting or diarrhea, or if you have increased thirst, decreased appetite, or are sweating more than usual. You can easily become dehydrated while taking sotalol. This can lead to very low blood pressure, a serious electrolyte imbalance, or kidney failure.</p><p>You will need frequent medical tests. Your heart function may need to be checked using an electrocardiograph or ECG (sometimes called an EKG). You may also need heart function tests for 1 to 2 weeks after your last dose.</p><p>Keep using this medicine as directed, even if you feel well. You may need to take sotalol for the rest of your life.</p><p><b>Do not skip doses or stop using sotalol without your doctor's advice.</b> Stopping suddenly may make your condition worse. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.</p><p>If you need surgery, tell your surgeon you currently use this medicine.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Do not allow liquid medicine to freeze.</p><p>Your pharmacist may prepare an oral suspension (liquid) form of sotalol. Keep the suspension at room temperature and throw away suspension any left over after 3 months of use.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Skip the missed dose and use your next dose at the regular time. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><p>Try not to miss any doses. Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>An overdose of sotalol can be fatal.</b></p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking sotalol?</h2><p>Avoid taking an antacid within 2 hours before or 2 hours after you take sotalol.
