</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Antineoplastic Agent</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Eribulin</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for eribulin</h2><p>Eribulin injection is used to treat metastatic (cancer that has already spread to other parts of the body) breast cancer in patients who have already received other types of cancer medicines. Eribulin injection is also used to treat metastatic liposarcoma or liposarcoma that cannot be removed with surgery in patients who have received other types of cancer medicines.</p><p>Eribulin belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by eribulin, other side effects may occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor right away. Some unwanted effects may not be serious but may cause concern. Some of the unwanted effects do not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.</p><p>Before you begin treatment with eribulin, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits of eribulin as well as the risks.</p><p>Eribulin is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using eribulin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of eribulin injection in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of eribulin</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you eribulin in a hospital or cancer treatment center. Eribulin is given through a needle placed in one of your veins.</p><p>Eribulin is usually given on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 21-day cycle of treatment. This 2-day treatment is given again every 21 days until your body responds to the medicine or you and your doctor decide to stop the treatment. Each treatment usually takes about 2 to 5 minutes.</p><p>Eribulin comes with a patient information leaflet. It is very important that you read and understand this information. Be sure to ask your doctor about anything you do not understand.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using eribulin</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress closely</i> to make sure that eribulin is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Using eribulin while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control during treatment and for at least 2 weeks after your final dose to keep from getting pregnant. Male patients should also use effective form of birth control during and for 3.5 months after treatment with eribulin. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Eribulin can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>Check with your doctor right away if you are having burning, numbness, tingling, or painful sensations in the arms, hands, legs, or feet. These could be symptoms of a condition called peripheral neuropathy.</p><p>Eribulin can cause changes in heart rhythms, such as a condition called QT prolongation. It may change the way your heart beats and cause fainting or serious side effects in some patients. Contact your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of heart rhythm problems, such as fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeats.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Eribulin side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
