</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of bevacizumab-bvzr</h2><p>Medicines used to treat cancer are very strong and can have many side effects. Before receiving bevacizumab-bvzr, make sure you understand all the risks and benefits. It is important for you to work closely with your doctor during your treatment.</p><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you bevacizumab-bvzr in a medical facility.

If you are using a combination of medicines, make sure that you take each one at the proper time and do not mix them.

Blood and urine tests are needed to check for unwanted effects. Be sure to keep all appointments. You may be taught how to check your blood pressure at home.</p><p>Receiving bevacizumab-bvzr while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby.

<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>

These could be symptoms of a serious kidney problem.</p><p>Bevacizumab-bvzr may cause infusion-related reactions, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention.
