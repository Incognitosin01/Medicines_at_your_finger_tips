COVID-19 is spread from person to person through the air.</p><p>COVID-19 can affect your lungs or other organs. Symptoms may be mild or serious and include fever, chills, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, tiredness, body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, runny or stuffy nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized emergency use of COVID-19 vaccine to help prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2. The Pfizer vaccine is for use in people who are at least 16 years old.</p><p>This vaccine may help your body develop immunity to SARS-CoV-2. However, this vaccine has not been approved to prevent or treat coronavirus or COVID-19.</p><p>COVID-19 vaccine is experimental and all of its risks are not yet known. The COVID-19 vaccine does not contain coronavirus and cannot give you COVID-19.</p><p>Like any vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine may not provide protection in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>The FDA has authorized emergency use of this vaccine as it may help prevent infection with COVID-19. This vaccine has not been approved to prevent or treat coronavirus or COVID-19.</p><p><b>Becoming infected with COVID-19 is much more dangerous to your health than receiving this vaccine.</b></p><p>If you have a certain type of reaction after the first dose of this vaccine, your healthcare provider will determine if you can safely receive the second dose.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive this vaccine if you've ever had an allergic reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine. Your healthcare provider will determine whether any reaction you have would prevent you from safely getting the second dose.</p><p>If you are infected with COVID-19, are waiting for testing results, or are exposed to someone infected with COVID-19: You may not be able to receive this vaccine until you have no symptoms and/or your required quarantine period has ended.</p><p>Tell the person giving you this vaccine if you have a fever, or if:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>you've received any treatment or medication for COVID-19 infection in the past 90 days;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you've received or will receive any other vaccine within 14 days before or after your COVID-19 vaccine;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have a weak immune system caused by disease or by using certain medicine (this vaccine may not be as effective if you are immunosuppressed);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have bleeding problems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you use a blood thinner (such as warfarin, Coumadin, or Jantoven); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>you've received any treatment or medication for COVID-19 infection in the past 90 days;</p><p>you've received or will receive any other vaccine within 14 days before or after your COVID-19 vaccine;</p><p>you have a weak immune system caused by disease or by using certain medicine (this vaccine may not be as effective if you are immunosuppressed);</p><p>you have bleeding problems;</p><p>you use a blood thinner (such as warfarin, Coumadin, or Jantoven); or</p><p>you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><p>COVID-19 is more likely to cause serious illness or death in a pregnant woman. Not all risks are known yet, but this vaccine is likely to be less harmful than becoming infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy.</p><h2>How is this vaccine given?</h2><p>Read all vaccine information sheets provided to you.</p><p>COVID-19 vaccine is given as an injection (shot) into a muscle, in a series of 2 shots given 3 weeks apart. Your first and second shot should both be the Pfizer type of COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>You will receive a reminder card showing the date and type of your first injection. Take this card with you when you get your second shot.</p><p>It may take a few weeks for your body to build immunity to COVID-19. You may become infected with COVID-19 if the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection.</p><p><b>Receiving this vaccine will not make you less contagious to other people if you are already infected with COVID-19 but you have no symptoms.</b> Keep using infection control methods such as self-isolation, social distancing, hand-washing, using protective face covering, disinfecting surfaces you touch a lot, and not sharing personal items with others.</p><p>Receiving a COVID-19 vaccine will not cause you to test positive on a coronavirus test. However, once your body develops immunity to COVID-19, you could test positive on an antibody test (a test to detect immunity in your body from previous exposure to coronavirus).</p><p>It is not known how long this vaccine will protect you from infection with COVID-19. It also is not known how long immunity will last in a person who's been infected with and recovered from COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccine is still being studied and all of its risks are not yet known.</p><p>COVID-19 vaccine is transported and stored at ultra-cold temperatures. However, this vaccine will be at room temperature when it is injected into your arm.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p><b>Be sure to receive all recommended doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine or you may not be fully protected.</b> Contact your doctor, pharmacist, or health department if you miss your second dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of this vaccine is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving this vaccine?</h2><p>Avoid receiving other vaccines without first seeking medical advice.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">This vaccine side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives, itching; confusion, dizziness, fainting; vomiting, diarrhea; fast heartbeats, wheezing, difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>An allergic reaction is more likely to occur within 30 minutes after you receive the vaccine. You will be treated quickly if you have a reaction.</p><p>You should not receive the second vaccine if the first shot caused an allergic reaction. Your healthcare provider will determine if you can safely receive the second dose.</p><p>Becoming infected with COVID-19 is much more dangerous to your health than receiving this vaccine. <b>Serious side effects other than an allergic reaction may include:</b></p><ul>
