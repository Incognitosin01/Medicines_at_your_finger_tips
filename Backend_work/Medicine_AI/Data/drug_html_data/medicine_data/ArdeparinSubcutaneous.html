These blood clots can travel to the lungs and can become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing a condition called pulmonary embolism. Ardeparin is used for several days after knee replacement surgery, while you are unable to walk. It is during this time that blood clots are most likely to form. Ardeparin also may be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.</p><p>Ardeparin is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using ardeparin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make.

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.
