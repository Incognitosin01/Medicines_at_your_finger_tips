Peramivir belongs to the family of medicines called antivirals, which are used to treat infections caused by viruses.</p><p>Peramivir is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using peramivir</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For peramivir, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to peramivir or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of peramivir injection in children 2 years of age and older. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 2 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of peramivir injection in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving peramivir, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using peramivir with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of peramivir. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Kidney disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.</li>

It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. The medicine must be injected slowly, so your IV tube will need to stay in place for 15 to 30 minutes.</p><p>Peramivir should be given as soon as possible after flu symptoms start or after you are exposed to the flu (within the first 2 days).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using peramivir</h2><p><i>Your doctor will check your or your child's progress closely while you are receiving peramivir</i>.

Tell your doctor right away if you have hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there) or unusual excitement, nervousness, or restlessness after receiving peramivir.</p><p>Make sure your doctor knows if you plan to get the live flu vaccine nasal spray before you start receiving peramivir. You should not use the vaccine within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after receiving peramivir.</p><p>If your symptoms do not improve after you receive peramivir, or if they become worse, check with your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Peramivir side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
