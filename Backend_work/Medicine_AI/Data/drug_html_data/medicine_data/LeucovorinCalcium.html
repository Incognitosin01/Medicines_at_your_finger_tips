Leucovorin actively competes with methotrexate for transport sites, displaces methotrexate from intracellular binding sites, and restores active folate stores required for DNA/RNA synthesis. Leucovorin stabilizes the binding of 5-dUMP and thymidylate synthetase, enhancing the activity of fluorouracil. When administered with pyrimethamine for the treatment of opportunistic infections, leucovorin reduces the risk for hematologic toxicity (HHS [OI adult 2020]).</p><p>Methanol toxicity treatment: Formic acid (methanol’s toxic metabolite) is normally metabolized to carbon dioxide and water by 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase after being bound to tetrahydrofolate. Administering a source of tetrahydrofolate may aid the body in eliminating formic acid (AACT [Barceloux] 2002).</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Oral, IM: Well absorbed </p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Intestinal mucosa and hepatically to 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5MTHF; active)</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (primarily); feces</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Oral: ~2 hours; IV: Total folates: 10 minutes; 5MTHF: ~1 hour; IM: Total folates: 52 minutes; 5MTHF: 2.8 hours</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>~4 to 8 hours</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Colorectal cancer, advanced:</b> Injection: Palliative treatment of advanced colorectal cancer to prolong survival (in combination with fluorouracil).</p><p><b>Megaloblastic anemia: </b> Injection: Treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency (when oral therapy is not feasible).</p><p><b>Methotrexate toxicity:</b></p><p>Injection: Rescue agent after high-dose methotrexate treatment in osteosarcoma and to diminish the toxicity and counteract the effects of impaired methotrexate elimination and of inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists.</p><p>Oral: Rescue agent to diminish toxicity and counteract effects of impaired methotrexate elimination and inadvertent overdoses of folic acid antagonists.</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Acute lymphocytic leukemia</h3><p>Data from 2 studies support the use of leucovorin calcium as a component of the hyper-CVAD regimen, which consists of alternating cycles of cyclophosphamide, mesna, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone, and high-dose methotrexate/leucovorin rescue and cytarabine, in the management of acute lymphocytic leukemia in adults <sup>[Kantarjian 2004]</sup>, <sup>[Thomas 2004]</sup>.</p><h3>Bladder cancer (neoadjuvant treatment)</h3><p>Data from a large, international, phase 3 study support the use of leucovorin calcium (as methotrexate rescue; in combination with cisplatin, vinblastine, and methotrexate) for neoadjuvant treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer <sup>[Griffiths 2011]</sup>.</p><h3>Dermatomyositis/polymyositis</h3><p>Methotrexate may be of benefit in the management of dermatomyositis/polymyositis; concomitant folic acid is recommended to reduce side effects associated with methotrexate.

Monitoring of the serum methotrexate concentration is essential to determine the optimal dose/duration of leucovorin; however, do not wait for the results of a methotrexate level before initiating leucovorin. It is important to adjust the leucovorin dose once a methotrexate level is known.
