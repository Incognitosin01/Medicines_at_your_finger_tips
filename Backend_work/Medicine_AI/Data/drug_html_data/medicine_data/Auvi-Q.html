Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Do not inject this medicine if you do not understand these instructions. Use the medicine exactly as directed. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Do not give this medicine to a child without medical advice.</p><p>Auvi-Q is injected into the skin (subcutaneously) or muscle (intramuscularly) of your outer thigh. In an emergency, this injection can be given through your clothing.</p><p>Your medicine may also come with a "trainer pen." The trainer pen contains no medicine and no needle. It is only for non-emergency use to practice giving yourself an Auvi-Q injection.</p><p>Do not remove the safety cap until you are ready to use the auto-injector. Never put your fingers over the injector tip when removing the safety cap or after the safety cap has been removed.</p><p>To use an Auvi-Q auto-injector:</p><p>Auvi-Q contains an electronic voice instruction system to help guide you through each step of your injection.

It will still work during an allergic reaction emergency.</p><p>Pull Auvi-Q up from the outer case.</p><p>Pull Red safety guard down and off of Auvi-Q.

Pull firmly to remove.</p><p>Place black end of Auvi-Q against the middle of the outer thigh (through clothing, if needed), then push firmly until you hear a click and hiss sound, and hold in place for 2 seconds.

If you are administering Auvi-Q to a young child or infant, hold the leg firmly in place while administering an injection.</p><p>The needle automatically retracts after the injection is complete, so the needle will not be visible after the injection.
