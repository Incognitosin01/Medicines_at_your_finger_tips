Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures<span class="Sup">1</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Arsenic Trioxide Injection is an injectable solution for intravenous administration and is available as:</p><p>Injection: 10 mg arsenic trioxide in 10 mL clear solution in a single-dose vial.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Arsenic Trioxide Injection is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to arsenic.<br/></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Differentiation Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Differentiation syndrome, which may be life-threatening or fatal, has been observed in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated with arsenic trioxide. In clinical trials, 16% to 23% of patients treated with arsenic trioxide for APL developed differentiation syndrome. Signs and symptoms include unexplained fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, acute respiratory distress, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusion, weight gain, peripheral edema, hypotension, renal insufficiency, hepatopathy and multi-organ dysfunction. Differentiation syndrome has been observed with and without concomitant leukocytosis, and it has occurred as early as day 1 of induction to as late as the second month induction therapy.</p><p>If differentiation syndrome is suspected, temporarily withhold arsenic trioxide and immediately initiate dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously every 12 hours and hemodynamic monitoring until resolution of signs and symptoms for a minimum of 3 days <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Patients treated with arsenic trioxide can develop QTc prolongation, torsade de pointes, and complete atrioventricular block. In the clinical trial of patients with relapsed or refractory APL treated with arsenic trioxide monotherapy, 40% had at least one ECG tracing with a QTc interval greater than 500 msec. A prolonged QTc was observed between 1 and 5 weeks after start of arsenic trioxide infusion, and it usually resolved by 8 weeks after arsenic trioxide infusion. There are no data on the effect of arsenic trioxide on the QTc interval during the infusion of the drug.</p><p>The risk of torsade de pointes is related to the extent of QTc prolongation, concomitant administration of QTc prolonging drugs, a history of torsade de pointes, pre-existing QTc interval prolongation, congestive heart failure, administration of potassium-wasting diuretics, or other conditions that result in hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. The risk may be increased when arsenic trioxide is co-administered with medications that can lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>Prior to initiating therapy with arsenic trioxide, assess the QTc interval by electrocardiogram, correct pre-existing electrolyte abnormalities, and consider discontinuing drugs known to prolong QTc interval. Do not administer arsenic trioxide to patients with a ventricular arrhythmia or prolonged QTc. If possible, discontinue drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval. If it is not possible to discontinue the interacting drug, perform cardiac monitoring frequently <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. During arsenic trioxide therapy, maintain potassium concentrations above 4 mEq/L and magnesium concentrations above 1.8 mg/dL. Monitor ECG weekly and more frequently for clinically unstable patients.</p><p>For patients who develop a QTc Framingham greater than 450 msec for men or greater than 460 msec for women, withhold arsenic trioxide and any medication known to prolong the QTc interval. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. When the QTc normalizes and electrolyte abnormalities are corrected, resume arsenic trioxide at a reduced dose <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.<br/></p><h3>Encephalopathy</h3><p class="First">Serious encephalopathies were reported in patients receiving arsenic trioxide. Monitor patients for neurological symptoms, such as confusion, decreased level of consciousness, seizures, cognitive deficits, ataxia, visual symptoms and ocular motor dysfunction. Advise patients and caregivers of the need for close observation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Wernicke’s Encephalopathy</span></p><p>Wernicke’s encephalopathy occurred in patients receiving arsenic trioxide. Wernicke’s encephalopathy is a neurologic emergency that can be prevented and treated with thiamine. Consider testing thiamine levels in patients at risk for thiamine deficiency (e.g., chronic alcohol use, malabsorption, nutritional deficiency, concomitant use of furosemide). Administer parenteral thiamine in patients with or at risk for thiamine deficiency. Monitor patients for neurological symptoms and nutritional status while receiving arsenic trioxide. If Wernicke’s encephalopathy is suspected, immediately interrupt arsenic trioxide and initiate parenteral thiamine. Monitor until symptoms resolve or improve and thiamine levels normalize.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Long-term liver abnormalities can occur in patients with APL treated with arsenic trioxide.</p><p>During treatment with arsenic trioxide, monitor hepatic function tests at least twice weekly during induction and at least once weekly during consolidation. Withhold arsenic trioxide if elevations in AST or alkaline phosphatase occur to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal and/or elevation in serum total bilirubin occurs to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal and resume at reduced dose upon resolution <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis</h3><p class="First">The active ingredient of Arsenic Trioxide Injection, arsenic trioxide, is a human carcinogen. Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Arsenic trioxide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Arsenic trioxide was embryolethal and teratogenic in rats when administered on gestation day 9 at a dose approximately 10 times the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m² basis. A related trivalent arsenic, sodium arsenite, produced teratogenicity when administered during gestation in mice at a dose approximately 5 times the projected human dose on a mg/m² basis and in hamsters at an intravenous dose approximately equivalent to the projected human daily dose on a mg/m² basis.</p><p>Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with arsenic trioxide and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with arsenic trioxide and for 3 months after the last dose <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:<br/></p><ul class="Disc">

Forty patients in the Study PLRXAS01 received the recommended dose of 0.15 mg/kg, of whom 28 completed both induction and consolidation cycles. An additional 12 patients with relapsed or refractory APL received doses generally similar to the recommended dose.</p><p>Serious adverse reactions observed in the  40 patients with refractory or relapsed APL enrolled in Study PLRXAS01 included differentiation syndrome (n=3), hyperleukocytosis (n=3), QTc interval ≥ 500 msec (n=16, 1 with torsade de pointes), atrial dysrhythmias (n=2), and hyperglycemia (n=2).</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (&gt; 30%) were nausea, cough, fatigue, pyrexia, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, tachycardia, diarrhea, dyspnea, hypokalemia, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, hypomagnesemia, insomnia, dermatitis, edema, QTc prolongation, rigors, sore throat, arthralgia, paresthesia, and pruritus.</p><p>Table 5 describes the adverse reactions in patients aged 5 to 73 years with APL who received arsenic trioxide at the recommended dose.

Arsenic trioxide was embryolethal and teratogenic in rats when administered on gestation day 9 at a dose approximately 10 times the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m² basis (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>). A related trivalent arsenic, sodium arsenite, produced teratogenicity when administered during gestation in mice at a dose approximately 5 times the projected human dose on a mg/m² basis and in hamsters at an intravenous dose approximately equivalent to the projected human daily dose on a mg/m² basis. There are no studies with the use of arsenic trioxide in pregnant women, and limited published data on arsenic trioxide use during pregnancy are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>One patient was reported to deliver a live infant with no reported congenital anomalies after receiving arsenic trioxide during the first five months of pregnancy. A second patient became pregnant three months after discontinuing arsenic trioxide and was reported to have a normal pregnancy outcome. A third patient was a pregnant healthcare provider who experienced dermal contact with liquid arsenic trioxide and had a normal pregnancy outcome after treatment and monitoring. A fourth patient who became pregnant while receiving arsenic trioxide had a miscarriage.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Studies in pregnant mice, rats, hamsters, and primates have shown that inorganic arsenicals cross the placental barrier when given orally or by injection. An increase in resorptions, neural-tube defects, anophthalmia and microphthalmia were observed in rats administered 10 mg/kg of arsenic trioxide on gestation day 9 (approximately 10 times the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m² basis). Similar findings occurred in mice administered a 10 mg/kg dose of a related trivalent arsenic, sodium arsenite (approximately 5 times the projected human dose on a mg/m² basis), on gestation days 6, 7, 8, or 9. Intravenous injection of 2 mg/kg sodium arsenite (approximately equivalent to the projected human daily dose on a mg/m² basis) on gestation day 7 (the lowest dose tested) resulted in neural-tube defects in hamsters. <br/></p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Arsenic trioxide is excreted in human milk. There are no data on the effects of arsenic trioxide on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with arsenic trioxide and for 2 weeks after the final dose.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Arsenic trioxide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Testing</span></p><p>Conduct pregnancy testing in females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of arsenic trioxide<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Contraception</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Females</span></p><p>Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with arsenic trioxide and for 6 months after the final dose.</p><p><span class="Italics">Males</span></p><p>Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with arsenic trioxide and for 3 months after the final dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Males</span></p><p>Based on testicular toxicities including decreased testicular weight and impaired spermatogenesis observed in animal studies, arsenic trioxide may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of arsenic trioxide as a single agent for treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory APL is supported by the pivotal phase 2 study in 40 patients with relapsed or refractory APL. Five patients below the age of 18 years (age range: 5 to 16 years) were treated with arsenic trioxide at the recommended dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day. A literature review included an additional 17 patients treated with arsenic trioxide for relapsed or refractory APL, with ages ranging from 4 to 21 years. No differences in efficacy and safety were observed by age. <br/></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Use of arsenic trioxide as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory APL is supported by the open-label, single-arm trial that included 6 patients aged 65 and older (range: 65 to 73 years). A literature review included an additional 4 patients aged 69 to 72 years who were treated with arsenic trioxide for relapsed or refractory APL. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients.<br/></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Exposure of arsenic trioxide may be higher in patients with severe renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Monitor patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] less than 30 mL/min) frequently for toxicity; a dose reduction may be warranted.</p><p>The use of arsenic trioxide in patients on dialysis has not been studied. <br/></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Since limited data are available across all hepatic impairment groups, caution is advised in the use of arsenic trioxide in patients with hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Monitor patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) frequently for toxicity.<br/></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Manifestations</span></p><p>Manifestations of arsenic trioxide overdosage include convulsions, muscle weakness, and confusion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Management</span></p><p>For symptoms of arsenic trioxide overdosage, immediately discontinue arsenic trioxide and consider chelation therapy.</p><p>A conventional protocol for acute arsenic intoxication includes dimercaprol administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg intramuscularly every 4 hours until immediate life-threatening toxicity has subsided. Thereafter, penicillamine at a dose of 250 mg orally, up to a maximum frequency of four times per day (≤ 1 g per day), may be given.</p><h2>Arsenic Trioxide Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Arsenic Trioxide Injection is a sterile injectable solution of arsenic trioxide. The molecular formula of arsenic trioxide in the solid state is As<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>, with a molecular weight of 197.84 g/mol and has the following structural formula:</p><p>Arsenic trioxide is a white to off-white powder. It is practically insoluble to sparingly soluble in water. It dissolves in solutions of alkali hydroxides (NaOH 1 M). It is practically insoluble in ethanol, chloroform and ethyl ether.</p><p>Arsenic Trioxide Injection is available in 10 mL, single-dose vials containing 10 mg of arsenic trioxide. Arsenic Trioxide Injection is formulated as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, clear solution of arsenic trioxide in water for injection using sodium hydroxide and dilute hydrochloric acid to adjust to pH 8. Arsenic Trioxide Injection is preservative-free. Arsenic trioxide, the active ingredient, is present at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Inactive ingredients and their respective approximate concentrations are sodium hydroxide (1.2 mg/mL) for solubilization, and sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment to pH 8.<br/></p><h2>Arsenic Trioxide Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide is not completely understood. Arsenic trioxide causes morphological changes and DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in NB4 human promyelocytic leukemia cells <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Arsenic trioxide also causes damage or degradation of the fusion protein promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-alpha.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>In a single-arm trial of arsenic trioxide (0.15 mg/kg daily), 16 of 40 patients (40%) had a QTc interval greater than 500 msec. Prolongation of the QTc was observed between 1 and 5 weeks after arsenic trioxide infusion, and then returned towards baseline by the end of 8 weeks after arsenic trioxide infusion.</p><p> <br/></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The inorganic, lyophilized form of arsenic trioxide, when placed into solution, immediately forms the hydrolysis product arsenious acid (As<span class="Sup">III</span>). As<span class="Sup">III</span> is the pharmacologically active species of arsenic trioxide. Monomethylarsonic acid (MMA<span class="Sup">V</span>), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA<span class="Sup">V</span>) are the main pentavalent metabolites formed during metabolism, in addition to arsenic acid (As<span class="Sup">V</span>) a product of As<span class="Sup">III</span> oxidation. The pharmacokinetics of arsenical species ([As<span class="Sup">III</span>], [As<span class="Sup">V</span>], [MMA<span class="Sup">V</span>], [DMA<span class="Sup">V</span>]) were determined in 6 APL patients following once-daily doses of 0.15 mg/kg for 5 days per week. Over the total single-dose range of 7 to 32 mg (administered as 0.15 mg/kg), systemic exposure (AUC) appears to be linear. Peak plasma concentrations of arsenious acid (As<span class="Sup">III</span>), the primary active arsenical species were reached at the end of infusion (2 hours). Plasma concentration of As<span class="Sup">III</span> declined in a biphasic manner with a mean elimination half-life of 10 to 14 hours and is characterized by an initial rapid distribution phase followed by a slower terminal elimination phase. The daily exposure to As<span class="Sup">III</span> (mean AUC<span class="Sub">0-24h</span>) was 194 ng·hr/mL (n=5) on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 332 ng·hr/mL (n=6) on Day 25 of Cycle 1, which represents an approximate 2-fold accumulation. The primary pentavalent metabolites, MMA<span class="Sup">V</span> and DMA<span class="Sup">V</span>, are slow to appear in plasma (approximately 10 to 24 hours after first administration of arsenic trioxide), but, due to their longer half-life, accumulate more upon multiple dosing than does As<span class="Sup">III</span>. The mean estimated terminal elimination half-lives of the metabolites MMA<span class="Sup">V</span> and DMA<span class="Sup">V</span> are 32 hours and 72 hours, respectively. Approximate accumulation ranged from 1.4- to 8-fold following multiple dosing as compared to single-dose administration. As<span class="Sup">V</span> is present in plasma only at relatively low levels.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The volume of distribution (V<span class="Sub">ss</span>) for As<span class="Sup">III</span> is large (mean 562 L, N=10) indicating that As<span class="Sup">III</span> is widely distributed throughout body tissues. V<span class="Sub">ss</span> is also dependent on body weight and increases as body weight increases.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Much of the As<span class="Sup">III</span> is distributed to the tissues where it is methylated to the less cytotoxic metabolites, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA<span class="Sup">V</span>) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA<span class="Sup">V</span>) by methyltransferases primarily in the liver. The metabolism of arsenic trioxide also involves oxidation of As<span class="Sup">III</span> to As<span class="Sup">V</span>, which may occur in numerous tissues via enzymatic or nonenzymatic processes. As<span class="Sup">V</span> is present in plasma only at relatively low levels following administration of arsenic trioxide.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Approximately 15% of the administered arsenic trioxide dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged As<span class="Sup">III</span>. The methylated metabolites of As<span class="Sup">III</span> (MMA<span class="Sup">V</span>, DMA<span class="Sup">V</span>) are primarily excreted in the urine. The total clearance of As<span class="Sup">III</span> is 49 L/h and the renal clearance is 9 L/h. Clearance is not dependent on body weight or dose administered over the range of 7 mg to 32 mg.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of As<span class="Sup">III</span>, As<span class="Sup">V</span>, and the pentavalent metabolites MMA<span class="Sup">V</span> and DMA<span class="Sup">V</span> was evaluated in 20 patients with advanced malignancies. Patients were classified as having normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CLcr] &gt; 80 mL/min, n=6), mild renal impairment (CLcr 50 to 80 mL/min, n=5), moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 49 mL/min, n=6), or severe renal impairment (CLcr &lt; 30 mL/min, n=3). Following twice-weekly administration of 0.15 mg/kg over a 2-hour infusion, the mean AUC<span class="Sub">0-INF</span> for As<span class="Sup">III</span> was comparable among the normal, mild and moderate renal impairment groups. However, in the <span class="Bold">severe</span> renal impairment group, the mean AUC<span class="Sub">0-INF</span> for As<span class="Sup">III</span> was approximately 48% higher than that in the normal group. </p><p>Systemic exposure to MMA<span class="Sup">V</span> and DMA<span class="Sup">V</span> tended to be larger in patients with renal impairment; however, the clinical consequences of this increased exposure are not known. As<span class="Sup">V</span> plasma levels were generally below the limit of assay quantitation in patients with impaired renal function <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>. The use of arsenic trioxide in patients on dialysis has not been studied.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>The effect of pharmacokinetics of As<span class="Sup">III</span>, As<span class="Sup">V</span>, and the pentavalent metabolites MMA<span class="Sup">V</span> and DMA<span class="Sup">V</span> was evaluated following administration of 0.25 to 0.50 mg/kg of arsenic trioxide in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients were classified as having normal hepatic function (n=4), mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, n=12), moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B, n=3), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C, n=1). No clear trend toward an increase in systemic exposure to As<span class="Sup">III</span>, As<span class="Sup">V</span>, MMA<span class="Sup">V</span> or DMA<span class="Sup">V</span> was observed with decreasing level of hepatic function as assessed by dose-normalized (per mg dose) AUC in the mild and moderate hepatic impairment groups. However, the one patient with severe hepatic impairment had mean dose-normalized AUC<span class="Sub">0-24h</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> values 40% and 70% higher, respectively, than those patients with normal hepatic function. The mean dose-normalized trough plasma levels for both MMA<span class="Sup">V</span> and DMA<span class="Sup">V</span> in this severely hepatically impaired patient were 2.2-fold and 4.7-fold higher, respectively, than those in the patients with normal hepatic function <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>Following intravenous administration of 0.15 mg/kg/day of arsenic trioxide in 10 APL patients (median age = 13.5 years, range 4 to 20 years), the daily exposure to As<span class="Sup">III</span> (mean AUC<span class="Sub">0-24h</span>) was 317 ng·hr/mL on Day 1 of Cycle 1 <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p>No formal assessments of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between arsenic trioxide and other drugs have been conducted. The methyltransferases responsible for metabolizing arsenic trioxide are not members of the cytochrome P450 family of isoenzymes. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> incubation of arsenic trioxide with human liver microsomes showed no inhibitory activity on substrates of the major cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes such as 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5, and 4A9/11. The pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates for these CYP enzymes are not expected to be affected by concomitant treatment with arsenic trioxide.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with arsenic trioxide  <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].</span></p><p>Arsenic trioxide and trivalent arsenite salts have not been demonstrated to be mutagenic to bacteria, yeast, or mammalian cells. Arsenite salts are clastogenic <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> (human fibroblast, human lymphocytes, Chinese hamster ovary cells, Chinese hamster V79 lung cells). Trivalent arsenic was genotoxic in the chromosome aberrations assay and micronucleus bone marrow assay in mice.</p><p>The effect of arsenic on fertility has not been adequately studied in humans. Decreased testicular weight and impaired spermatogenesis have been reported in animal studies. Male Wistar rat pups were administered 1.5 mg/kg sodium arsenite solution via the intraperitoneal route from postnatal days 1 to 14 and testes were collected for evaluation on postnatal days 15, 21, and 50. Results of this study revealed an altered morphology of the seminiferous tubules along with degeneration of spermatogenic cells, increased number of sperm with abnormal morphology, and decreased sperm counts. In beagle dogs administered intravenous arsenic trioxide for 90 days, reduced inner cell layers within seminiferous tubules and significantly decreased numbers of spermatocytes, spermatozoa, and sperm cells were observed at doses of 1 mg/kg/day and higher. The 1 mg/kg/day dose is approximately 3 times the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m² basis.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Relapsed or Refractory APL</h3><p class="First">Arsenic trioxide was investigated in Study PLRXAS01, an open-label, single-arm trial in 40 patients with relapsed or refractory APL who were previously treated with an anthracycline and a retinoid regimen. Patients received arsenic trioxide 0.15 mg/kg/day intravenously over 1 to 2 hours until the bone marrow was cleared of leukemic cells or for a maximum of 60 days. The CR (absence of visible leukemic cells in bone marrow and peripheral recovery of platelets and white blood cells with a confirmatory bone marrow ≥ 30 days later) rate in this population of previously treated patients was 28 of 40 (70%). Among the 22 patients who had relapsed less than one year after treatment with tretinoin, there were 18 complete responders (82%). Of the 18 patients receiving arsenic trioxide ≥ one year from tretinoin treatment, there were 10 complete responders (55%). The median time to bone marrow remission was 44 days and to onset of CR was 53 days. Three of 5 children, 5 years or older, achieved CR. No children less than 5 years old were treated.</p><p>Three to six weeks following bone marrow remission, 31 patients received consolidation therapy with arsenic trioxide, at the same dose, for 25 additional days over a period up to 5 weeks. In follow-up treatment, 18 patients received further arsenic trioxide as a maintenance course. Fifteen patients had bone marrow transplants. At last follow-up, 27 of 40 patients were alive with a median follow-up time of 484 days (range 280 to 755) and 23 of 40 patients remained in complete response with a median follow-up time of 483 days (range 280 to 755).</p><p>Cytogenetic conversion to no detection of the APL chromosome rearrangement was observed in 24 of 28 (86%) patients who met the response criteria defined above, in 5 of 5 (100%) patients who met some, but not all, of the response criteria, and 3 of 7 (43%) of patients who did not respond. RT-PCR conversions to no detection of the APL gene rearrangement were demonstrated in 22 of 28 (79%) of patients who met the response criteria, in 3 of 5 (60%) of patients who met some, but not all, of the response criteria, and in 2 of 7 (29%) of patients who did not respond.</p><p>Responses were seen across all age groups tested, ranging from 6 to 72 years. The ability to achieve a CR was similar for both sexes. There were insufficient patients of Black, Hispanic, or Asian ancestry to estimate relative response rates in these groups, but responses were seen in each group.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">How Supplied</span></p><p>Arsenic Trioxide Injection is supplied as a sterile, clear, colorless solution in 10 mL glass, single-dose vials.</p><p>It is available as follows:</p><p>10 mg/10 mL (1 mg/mL) Single-Dose Vial:                               NDC 70121-1483-1</p><p>10 Single-Dose Vials in 1 Carton:                                             NDC 70121-1483-7</p><p><span class="Bold">Storage and Handling</span></p><p>Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].
