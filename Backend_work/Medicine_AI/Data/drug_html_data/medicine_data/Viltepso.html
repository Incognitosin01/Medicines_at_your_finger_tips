</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="faq">Popular FAQ</h2><p>Viltepso's mechanism of action is to “hide” exon 53, causing cells to bypass this exon and permitting the remaining exons to fit together properly. This allows the body to form a shortened version of the dystrophin protein. Viltepso (viltolarsen) injection helps the body to make dystrophin, a protein found in muscle cells. Dystrophin helps to strengthen and protect muscles. When exons are missing, cells do not have the proper instructions to make dystrophin. Continue reading</p><p>The length of time it takes for Viltepso (viltolarsen) to work in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is still being evaluated in an ongoing study. Small studies showed an increase in the dystrophin protein (a "marker") in the muscle cells of patients with DMD after 20 to 24 weeks. Researchers believe that this increase in dystrophin may predict a clinical benefit in patients, but that is not yet proven.
