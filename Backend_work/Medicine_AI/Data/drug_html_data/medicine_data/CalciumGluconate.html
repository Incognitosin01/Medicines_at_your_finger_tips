Calcium is necessary for many normal functions of the body, especially bone formation and maintenance.</p><p>Calcium gluconate is used to prevent or to treat calcium deficiencies.</p><p>Calcium gluconate may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Do not take calcium gluconate or antacids that contain calcium without first asking your doctor if you also take other medicines. Calcium can make it harder for your body to absorb certain medicines. Calcium gluconate works best if you take it with food.</p><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package. Tell each of your healthcare providers about all your medical conditions, allergies, and all medicines you use.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>To make sure calcium gluconate is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Check the label on your brand of this medicine to see if it should be taken with or without food.</p><p>Take calcium gluconate <b>oral</b> with plenty of water.</p><p>Calcium gluconate injection is given as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>Tell your caregivers if you feel any burning, pain, or swelling around the IV needle when this medicine is injected.</p><p>Calcium gluconate may be only part of a complete program of treatment that also includes dietary changes.

Follow your doctor's instructions very closely.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Hypocalcemia:</b></p><p>Intravenous:<br/>
<br/>
500 to 2000 mg (5 to 20 mL) IV one time at a rate not to exceed 0.5 to 2 mL/min. The dose may be increased as needed. The usual daily dosage ranges from 1000 to 15,000 mg (10 to 150 mL) in divided doses or as a continuous infusion. Doses may be repeated every 1 to 3 days as needed and tolerated to normalize the serum calcium level.<br/>
<br/>
Oral:<br/>
<br/>
500 to 2000 mg orally 2 to 4 times a day.</p><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Hypermagnesemia:</b></p><p>1000 to 2000 mg (10 to 20 mL) IV one time at a rate not to exceed 0.5 to 2 mL/min. This dose may be repeated as necessary in severe cases of hypermagnesemia (where discontinuation of exogenous magnesium is inadequate) to temporarily reverse many of the toxic effects of magnesium in the central nervous system.</p><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Hyperkalemia:</b></p><p>500 to 3000 mg (5 to 30 mL) IV one time at a rate not to exceed 0.5 to 2 mL/min. This dose may be repeated as necessary in cases of extreme hyperkalemia cardiotoxicity when P waves are absent, the QRS complexes are widened, and when continuous ECG monitoring is available. The use of calcium does not reduce the serum potassium level, but counteracts the effects of hyperkalemia on cardiac excitability.</p><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Exchange Transfusion:</b></p><p>300 mg (3 mL) IV one time with each 100 mL of citrated blood at a rate not to exceed 0.5 to 2 mL/min.</p><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Osteoporosis:</b></p><p>1000 to 1500 mg/day orally in divided doses.</p><p><b>Usual Pediatric Dose for Hypocalcemia:</b></p><p>Neonatal:<br/>
