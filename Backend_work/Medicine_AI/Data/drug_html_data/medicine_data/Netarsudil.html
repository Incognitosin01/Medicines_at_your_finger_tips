Systemic absorption is minimal following ophthalmic application. If ophthalmic agents are needed during pregnancy, the minimum effective dose should be used in combination with punctal occlusion to decrease potential exposure to the fetus (Samples 1988).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat glaucoma.</p><p>• It is used to lower high eye pressure.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
