</ul><h3>Limitations of Gardasil Use and Effectiveness</h3><p class="First">The health care provider should inform the patient, parent, or guardian that vaccination does not eliminate the necessity for women to continue to undergo recommended cervical cancer screening. Women who receive Gardasil should continue to undergo cervical cancer screening per standard of care. <span class="Italics">[See Patient Counseling Information (17).]</span></p><p>Recipients of Gardasil should not discontinue anal cancer screening if it has been recommended by a health care provider. <span class="Italics">[See Patient Counseling Information (17).]</span></p><p>Gardasil has not been demonstrated to provide protection against disease from vaccine and non-vaccine HPV types to which a person has previously been exposed through sexual activity. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.4, 14.5).]</span></p><p>Gardasil is not intended to be used for treatment of active external genital lesions; cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers; CIN; VIN; VaIN; or AIN.</p><p>Gardasil has not been demonstrated to protect against diseases due to HPV types not contained in the vaccine. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.4, 14.5).]</span></p><p>Not all vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers are caused by HPV, and Gardasil protects only against those vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers caused by HPV 16 and 18.</p><p>Gardasil does not protect against genital diseases not caused by HPV.</p><p>Vaccination with Gardasil may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients.</p><p>Gardasil has not been demonstrated to prevent HPV-related CIN 2/3 or worse in women older than 26 years of age. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.7).]</span></p><h2>Gardasil Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage</h3><p class="First">Gardasil should be administered intramuscularly as a 0.5-mL dose at the following schedule: 0, 2 months, 6 months. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.8).]</span></p><h3>Method of Administration</h3><p class="First">For intramuscular use only.</p><p>Shake well before use. Thorough agitation immediately before administration is necessary to maintain suspension of the vaccine. Gardasil should not be diluted or mixed with other vaccines. After thorough agitation, Gardasil is a white, cloudy liquid. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use the product if particulates are present or if it appears discolored.</p><p>Gardasil should be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid region of the upper arm or in the higher anterolateral area of the thigh.</p><p>Syncope has been reported following vaccination with Gardasil and may result in falling with injury; observation for 15 minutes after administration is recommended. <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).]</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Single-Dose Vial Use</span></p><p>Withdraw the 0.5-mL dose of vaccine from the single-dose vial using a sterile needle and syringe and use promptly.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Prefilled Syringe Use</span></p><p>This package does not contain a needle. Shake well before use. Attach the needle by twisting in a clockwise direction until the needle fits securely on the syringe. Administer the entire dose as per standard protocol.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Gardasil is a suspension for intramuscular administration available in 0.5-mL single dose vials and prefilled syringes. See <span class="Italics">Description (11)</span> for the complete listing of ingredients.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Hypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions to yeast (a vaccine component), or after a previous dose of Gardasil. <span class="Italics">[See Description (11)</span>.<span class="Italics">]</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Syncope</h3><p class="First">Because vaccinees may develop syncope, sometimes resulting in falling with injury, observation for 15 minutes after administration is recommended. Syncope, sometimes associated with tonic-clonic movements and other seizure-like activity, has been reported following vaccination with Gardasil. When syncope is associated with tonic-clonic movements, the activity is usually transient and typically responds to restoring cerebral perfusion by maintaining a supine or Trendelenburg position.</p><h3>Managing Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be readily available in case of anaphylactic reactions following the administration of Gardasil.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Overall Summary of Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Headache, fever, nausea, and dizziness; and local injection site reactions (pain, swelling, erythema, pruritus, and bruising) occurred after administration with Gardasil.</p><p>Syncope, sometimes associated with tonic-clonic movements and other seizure-like activity, has been reported following vaccination with Gardasil and may result in falling with injury; observation for 15 minutes after administration is recommended. <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>.<span class="Italics">]</span></p><p>Anaphylaxis has been reported following vaccination with Gardasil.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Studies in Girls and Women (9 Through 45 Years of Age) and Boys and Men (9 Through 26 Years of Age)</span></p><p>In 7 clinical trials (5 Amorphous Aluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate [AAHS]-controlled, 1 saline placebo-controlled, and 1 uncontrolled), 18,083 individuals were administered Gardasil or AAHS control or saline placebo on the day of enrollment, and approximately 2 and 6 months thereafter, and safety was evaluated using vaccination report cards (VRC)-aided surveillance for 14 days after each injection of Gardasil or AAHS control or saline placebo in these individuals. The individuals who were monitored using VRC-aided surveillance included 10,088 individuals 9 through 45 years of age at enrollment who received Gardasil and 7,995 individuals who received AAHS control or saline placebo.

The VLPs are released from the yeast cells by cell disruption and purified by a series of chemical and physical methods. The purified VLPs are adsorbed on preformed aluminum-containing adjuvant (Amorphous Aluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate). The quadrivalent HPV VLP vaccine is a sterile liquid suspension that is prepared by combining the adsorbed VLPs of each HPV type and additional amounts of the aluminum-containing adjuvant and the final purification buffer.</p><p>Gardasil is a sterile suspension for intramuscular administration. Each 0.5-mL dose contains approximately 20 mcg of HPV 6 L1 protein, 40 mcg of HPV 11 L1 protein, 40 mcg of HPV 16 L1 protein, and 20 mcg of HPV 18 L1 protein.</p><p>Each 0.5-mL dose of the vaccine contains approximately 225 mcg of aluminum (as Amorphous Aluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate adjuvant), 9.56 mg of sodium chloride, 0.78 mg of L-histidine, 50 mcg of polysorbate 80, 35 mcg of sodium borate, &lt;7 mcg yeast protein/dose, and water for injection. The product does not contain a preservative or antibiotics.</p><p>After thorough agitation, Gardasil is a white, cloudy liquid.</p><h2>Gardasil - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">HPV only infects human beings. Animal studies with analogous animal papillomaviruses suggest that the efficacy of L1 VLP vaccines may involve the development of humoral immune responses. Human beings develop a humoral immune response to the vaccine, although the exact mechanism of protection is unknown.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Gardasil has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity or genotoxicity.</p><p>Gardasil administered to female rats at a dose of 120 mcg total protein, which is equivalent to the recommended human dose, had no effects on mating performance, fertility, or embryonic/fetal survival.</p><p>The effect of Gardasil on male fertility has been studied in male rats at an intramuscular dose of 0.5 mL/rat/occasion (120 mcg total protein which is equivalent to the recommended human dose). One group of male rats was administered Gardasil once, 3 days prior to cohabitation, and a second group of male rats was administered Gardasil three times, at 6 weeks, 3 weeks, and 3 days prior to cohabitation. There were no treatment-related effects on reproductive performance including fertility, sperm count, and sperm motility. There were no treatment-related gross or histomorphologic and weight changes on the testes.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">CIN 2/3 and AIS are the immediate and necessary precursors of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the cervix, respectively. Their detection and removal has been shown to prevent cancer; thus, they serve as surrogate markers for prevention of cervical cancer. In the clinical studies in girls and women aged 16 through 26 years, cases of CIN 2/3 and AIS were the efficacy endpoints to assess prevention of cervical cancer. In addition, cases of VIN 2/3 and VaIN 2/3 were the efficacy endpoints to assess prevention of HPV-related vulvar and vaginal cancers, and observations of external genital lesions were the efficacy endpoints for the prevention of genital warts.</p><p>In clinical studies in boys and men aged 16 through 26 years, efficacy was evaluated using the following endpoints: external genital warts and penile/perineal/perianal intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) grades 1/2/3 or penile/perineal/perianal cancer. In addition, cases of AIN grades 1/2/3 and anal cancer made up the composite efficacy endpoint used to assess prevention of HPV-related anal cancer.</p><p>Anal HPV infection, AIN, and anal cancer were not endpoints in the studies conducted in women. The similarity of HPV-related anal disease in men and women supports bridging the indication of prevention of AIN and anal cancer to women.</p><p>Efficacy was assessed in 6 AAHS-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies. The first Phase 2 study evaluated the HPV 16 component of Gardasil (Study 1, N = 2391 16- through 26-year-old girls and women) and the second evaluated all components of Gardasil (Study 2, N = 551 16- through 26-year-old girls and women). Two Phase 3 studies evaluated Gardasil in 5442 (Study 3) and 12,157 (Study 4) 16- through 26-year-old girls and women. A third Phase 3 study, Study 5, evaluated Gardasil in 4055 16- through 26-year-old boys and men, including a subset of 598 (Gardasil = 299; placebo = 299) men who self-identified as having sex with men (MSM population). A fourth Phase 3 study, Study 6, evaluated Gardasil in 3817 24- through 45-year-old women. Together, these six studies evaluated 28,413 individuals (20,541 girls and women 16 through 26 years of age at enrollment with a mean age of 20.0 years, 4055 boys and men 16 through 26 years of age at enrollment with a mean age of 20.5 years, and 3817 women 24 through 45 years of age at enrollment with a mean age of 34.3 years). The race distribution of the 16- through 26-year-old girls and women in the clinical trials was as follows: 70.4% White; 12.2% Hispanic (Black and White); 8.8% Other; 4.6% Black; 3.8% Asian; and 0.2% American Indian. The race distribution of the 16- through 26-year-old boys and men in the clinical trials was as follows: 35.2% White; 20.5% Hispanic (Black and White); 14.4% Other; 19.8% Black; 10.0% Asian; and 0.1% American Indian. The race distribution of the 24- through 45-year-old women in the clinical trials was as follows: 20.6% White; 43.2% Hispanic (Black and White); 0.2% Other; 4.8% Black; 31.2% Asian; and 0.1% American Indian.</p><p>The median duration of follow-up was 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.3, and 4.0 years for Study 1, Study 2, Study 3, Study 4, Study 5, and Study 6, respectively. Individuals received vaccine or AAHS control on the day of enrollment and 2 and 6 months thereafter. Efficacy was analyzed for each study individually and for all studies in girls and women combined according to a prospective clinical plan.</p><p>Overall, 73% of 16- through 26-year-old girls and women, 67% of 24- through 45-year-old women, and 83% of 16- through 26-year-old boys and men were naïve (i.e., PCR [Polymerase Chain Reaction] negative and seronegative for all 4 vaccine HPV types) to all 4 vaccine HPV types at enrollment.</p><p>A total of 27% of 16- through 26-year-old girls and women, 33% of 24- through 45-year-old women, and 17% of 16- through 26-year-old boys and men had evidence of prior exposure to or ongoing infection with at least 1 of the 4 vaccine HPV types. Among these individuals, 74% of 16- through 26-year-old girls and women, 71% of 24- through 45-year-old women, and 78% of 16- through 26-year-old boys and men had evidence of prior exposure to or ongoing infection with only 1 of the 4 vaccine HPV types and were naïve (PCR negative and seronegative) to the remaining 3 types.</p><p>In 24- through 45-year-old individuals, 0.4% had been exposed to all 4 vaccine HPV types.</p><p>In individuals who were naïve (PCR negative and seronegative) to all 4 vaccine HPV types, CIN, genital warts, VIN, VaIN, PIN, and persistent infection caused by any of the 4 vaccine HPV types were counted as endpoints.</p><p>Among individuals who were positive (PCR positive and/or seropositive) for a vaccine HPV type at Day 1, endpoints related to that type were not included in the analyses of prophylactic efficacy. Endpoints related to the remaining types for which the individual was naïve (PCR negative and seronegative) were counted.</p><p>For example, in individuals who were HPV 18 positive (PCR positive and/or seropositive) at Day 1, lesions caused by HPV 18 were not counted in the prophylactic efficacy evaluations. Lesions caused by HPV 6, 11, and 16 were included in the prophylactic efficacy evaluations. The same approach was used for the other types.</p><h3>Prophylactic Efficacy – HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in Girls and Women 16 through 26 Years of Age</h3><p class="First">Gardasil was administered without prescreening for presence of HPV infection and the efficacy trials allowed enrollment of girls and women regardless of baseline HPV status (i.e., PCR status or serostatus). Girls and women with current or prior HPV infection with an HPV type contained in the vaccine were not eligible for prophylactic efficacy evaluations for that type.</p><p>The primary analyses of efficacy with respect to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 were conducted in the per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population, consisting of girls and women who received all 3 vaccinations within 1 year of enrollment, did not have major deviations from the study protocol, and were naïve (PCR negative in cervicovaginal specimens and seronegative) to the relevant HPV type(s) (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) prior to dose 1 and through 1 month Postdose 3 (Month 7). Efficacy was measured starting after the Month 7 visit.</p><p>Gardasil was efficacious in reducing the incidence of CIN (any grade including CIN 2/3); AIS; genital warts; VIN (any grade); and VaIN (any grade) related to vaccine HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18 in those who were PCR negative and seronegative at baseline (Table 11).</p><p>In addition, girls and women who were already infected with 1 or more vaccine-related HPV types prior to vaccination were protected from precancerous cervical lesions and external genital lesions caused by the other vaccine HPV types.</p><p>Prophylactic efficacy against overall cervical and genital disease related to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 in an extension phase of Study 2, that included data through Month 60, was noted to be 100% (95% CI: 12.3%, 100.0%) among girls and women in the per protocol population naïve to the relevant HPV types.</p><p>Gardasil was efficacious against HPV disease caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in girls and women who were naïve for those specific HPV types at baseline.</p><h3>Prophylactic Efficacy – HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in Boys and Men 16 through 26 Years of Age</h3><p class="First">The primary analyses of efficacy were conducted in the per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population. This population consisted of boys and men who received all 3 vaccinations within 1 year of enrollment, did not have major deviations from the study protocol, and were naïve (PCR negative and seronegative) to the relevant HPV type(s) (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) prior to dose 1 and through 1 month postdose 3 (Month 7). Efficacy was measured starting after the Month 7 visit.</p><p>Gardasil was efficacious in reducing the incidence of genital warts related to vaccine HPV types 6 and 11 in those boys and men who were PCR negative and seronegative at baseline (Table 12). Efficacy against penile/perineal/perianal intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) grades 1/2/3 or penile/perineal/perianal cancer was not demonstrated as the number of cases was too limited to reach statistical significance.</p><h3>Prophylactic Efficacy – Anal Disease Caused by HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in Boys and Men 16 through 26 Years of Age in the MSM Sub-study</h3><p class="First">A sub-study of Study 5 evaluated the efficacy of Gardasil against anal disease (anal intraepithelial neoplasia and anal cancer) in a population of 598 MSM. The primary analyses of efficacy were conducted in the per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population of Study 5.</p><p>Gardasil was efficacious in reducing the incidence of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) grades 1 (both condyloma and non-acuminate), 2, and 3 related to vaccine HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in those boys and men who were PCR negative and seronegative at baseline (Table 13).</p><h3>Population Impact in Girls and Women 16 through 26 Years of Age</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Effectiveness of Gardasil in Prevention of HPV Types 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-Related Genital Disease in Girls and Women 16 Through 26 Years of Age, Regardless of Current or Prior Exposure to Vaccine HPV Types</span></p><p>The clinical trials included girls and women regardless of current or prior exposure to vaccine HPV types, and additional analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of Gardasil with respect to HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, and 18-related cervical and genital disease in these girls and women. Here, analyses included events arising among girls and women regardless of baseline PCR status and serostatus, including HPV infections that were present at the start of vaccination as well as events that arose from infections that were acquired after the start of vaccination.</p><p>The impact of Gardasil in girls and women regardless of current or prior exposure to a vaccine HPV type is shown in Table 14.

Vaccine impact in girls and women who were positive for vaccine HPV infection, as well as vaccine impact among girls and women regardless of baseline vaccine HPV PCR status and serostatus are also presented. The majority of CIN and genital warts, VIN, and VaIN related to a vaccine HPV type detected in the group that received Gardasil occurred as a consequence of HPV infection with the relevant HPV type that was already present at Day 1.</p><p>There was no clear evidence of protection from disease caused by HPV types for which girls and women were PCR positive regardless of serostatus at baseline.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Effectiveness of Gardasil in Prevention of Any HPV Type Related Genital Disease in Girls and Women 16 Through 26 Years of Age, Regardless of Current or Prior Infection with Vaccine or Non-Vaccine HPV Types</span></p><p>The impact of Gardasil against the overall burden of dysplastic or papillomatous cervical, vulvar, and vaginal disease regardless of HPV detection, results from a combination of prophylactic efficacy against vaccine HPV types, disease contribution from vaccine HPV types present at time of vaccination, the disease contribution from HPV types not contained in the vaccine, and disease in which HPV was not detected.</p><p>Additional efficacy analyses were conducted in 2 populations: (1) a generally HPV-naïve population (negative to 14 common HPV types and had a Pap test that was negative for SIL [Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion] at Day 1), approximating a population of sexually-naïve girls and women and (2) the general study population of girls and women regardless of baseline HPV status, some of whom had HPV-related disease at Day 1.</p><p>Among generally HPV-naïve girls and women and among all girls and women in the study population (including girls and women with HPV infection at Day 1), Gardasil reduced the overall incidence of CIN 2/3 or AIS; of VIN 2/3 or VaIN 2/3; of CIN (any grade) or AIS; and of Genital Warts (Table 15). These reductions were primarily due to reductions in lesions caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in girls and women naïve (seronegative and PCR negative) for the specific relevant vaccine HPV type. Infected girls and women may already have CIN 2/3 or AIS at Day 1 and some will develop CIN 2/3 or AIS during follow-up, either related to a vaccine or non-vaccine HPV type present at the time of vaccination or related to a non-vaccine HPV type not present at the time of vaccination.</p><h3>Population Impact in Boys and Men 16 through 26 Years of Age</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Effectiveness of Gardasil in Prevention of HPV Types 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-Related Anogenital Disease in Boys and Men 16 Through 26 Years of Age, Regardless of Current or Prior Exposure to Vaccine HPV Types</span></p><p>Study 5 included boys and men regardless of current or prior exposure to vaccine HPV types, and additional analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of Gardasil with respect to HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, and 18-related anogenital disease in these boys and men.

These reductions were primarily due to reductions in lesions caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in boys and men naïve (seronegative and PCR negative) for the specific relevant vaccine HPV type. Infected boys and men may already have anogenital disease at Day 1 and some will develop anogenital disease during follow-up, either related to a vaccine or non-vaccine HPV type present at the time of vaccination or related to a non-vaccine HPV type not present at the time of vaccination.</p><h3>Overall Population Impact</h3><p class="First">The subject characteristics (e.g. lifetime sex partners, geographic distribution of the subjects) influence the HPV prevalence of the population and therefore the population benefit can vary widely.</p><p>The overall efficacy of Gardasil will vary with the baseline prevalence of HPV infection and disease, the incidence of infections against which Gardasil has shown protection, and those infections against which Gardasil has not been shown to protect.</p><p>The efficacy of Gardasil for HPV types not included in the vaccine (i.e., cross-protective efficacy) is a component of the overall impact of the vaccine on rates of disease caused by HPV. Cross-protective efficacy was not demonstrated against disease caused by non-vaccine HPV types in the combined database of the Study 3 and Study 4 trials.</p><p>Gardasil does not protect against genital disease not related to HPV. One woman who received Gardasil in Study 3 developed an external genital well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma at Month 24. No HPV DNA was detected in the lesion or in any other samples taken throughout the study.</p><p>In 18,150 girls and women enrolled in Study 2, Study 3, and Study 4, Gardasil reduced definitive cervical therapy procedures by 23.9% (95% CI: 15.2%, 31.7%).</p><h3>Studies in Women 27 through 45 Years of Age</h3><p class="First">Study 6 evaluated efficacy in 3253 women 27 through 45 years of age based on a combined endpoint of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related persistent infection, genital warts, vulvar and vaginal dysplastic lesions of any grade, CIN of any grade, AIS, and cervical cancer. These women were randomized 1:1 to receive either Gardasil or AAHS control. The efficacy for the combined endpoint was driven primarily by prevention of persistent infection. There was no statistically significant efficacy demonstrated for CIN 2/3, AIS, or cervical cancer. In post hoc analyses conducted to assess the impact of Gardasil on the individual components of the combined endpoint, the results in the population of women naïve to the relevant HPV type at baseline were as follows: prevention of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related persistent infection (80.5% [95% CI: 68.3, 88.6]), prevention of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related CIN (any grade) (85.8% [95% CI: 52.4, 97.3]), and prevention of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related genital warts (87.6% [95% CI: 7.3, 99.7]).</p><p>Efficacy for disease endpoints was diminished in a population impact assessment of women who were vaccinated regardless of baseline HPV status (full analysis set). In the full analysis set (FAS), efficacy was not demonstrated for the following endpoints: prevention of HPV 16- and 18-related CIN 2/3, AIS, or cervical cancer and prevention of HPV 6- and 11-related condyloma.

Anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 GMTs as measured by cLIA were decreased compared with corresponding values at earlier time points, but the proportions of seropositive subjects ranged from 88.4% to 94.4% for anti-HPV 6, from 89.1% to 95.5% for anti-HPV 11, from 96.8% to 99.1% for anti-HPV 16, and from 60.0% to 64.1% for anti-HPV 18.</p><h3>Studies with RECOMBIVAX HB [hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant)]</h3><p class="First">The safety and immunogenicity of co-administration of Gardasil with RECOMBIVAX HB [hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant)] (same visit, injections at separate sites) were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, study of 1871 women aged 16 through 24 years at enrollment. The race distribution of the girls and women in the clinical trial was as follows: 61.6% White; 1.6% Hispanic (Black and White); 23.8% Other; 11.9% Black; 0.8% Asian; and 0.3% American Indian.</p><p>Subjects either received Gardasil and RECOMBIVAX HB (n = 466), Gardasil and RECOMBIVAX HB-matched placebo (n = 468), RECOMBIVAX HB and Gardasil-matched placebo (n = 467) or RECOMBIVAX-matched placebo and Gardasil-matched placebo (n = 470) at Day 1, Month 2 and Month 6. Immunogenicity was assessed for all vaccines 1 month post completion of the vaccination series.</p><p>Concomitant administration of Gardasil with RECOMBIVAX HB [hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant)] did not interfere with the antibody response to any of the vaccine antigens when Gardasil was given concomitantly with RECOMBIVAX HB or separately.</p><h3>Studies with Menactra [Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine] and Adacel [Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (Tdap)]</h3><p class="First">The safety and immunogenicity of co-administration of Gardasil with Menactra [Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine] and Adacel [Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (Tdap)] (same visit, injections at separate sites) were evaluated in an open-labeled, randomized, controlled study of 1040 boys and girls 11 through 17 years of age at enrollment. The race distribution of the subjects in the clinical trial was as follows: 77.7% White; 6.8% Hispanic (Black and White); 1.4% Multi-racial; 12.3% Black; 1.2% Asian; 0.2% Indian; and 0.4% American Indian.</p><p>One group received Gardasil in one limb and both Menactra and Adacel, as separate injections, in the opposite limb concomitantly on Day 1 (n = 517). The second group received the first dose of Gardasil on Day 1 in one limb then Menactra and Adacel, as separate injections, at Month 1 in the opposite limb (n = 523). Subjects in both vaccination groups received the second dose of Gardasil at Month 2 and the third dose at Month 6. Immunogenicity was assessed for all vaccines 1 month post completion of the vaccination series (1 dose for Menactra and Adacel and 3 doses for Gardasil).</p><p>Concomitant administration of Gardasil with Menactra [Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine] and Adacel [Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (Tdap)] did not interfere with the antibody response to any of the vaccine antigens when Gardasil was given concomitantly with Menactra and Adacel or separately.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">All presentations for Gardasil contain a suspension of 120 mcg L1 protein from HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in a 0.5-mL dose.
