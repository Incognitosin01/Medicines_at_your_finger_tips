**THE APPROVED DOSAGE IN CATTLE FED IN CONFINEMENT FOR SLAUGHTER IS 10<br/>
TO 20 MG OF BAMBERMYCINS/HD/DAY. The amount of bambermycins will range between<br/>
1 and 4 grams per ton of feed depending upon the daily feed consumption of the cattle fed in<br/>
confinement for slaughter. The amount of Type A Medicated Article added to the complete<br/>
ration (Type C Medicated Feed) must be based on daily feed consumption, the number of<br/>
animals in the pen and the level (10-20 mg/hd/day) of bambermycins being fed. From this<br/>
information the grams of bambermycins per ton of feed can be calculated in order to fulfill<br/>
feed assay requirements. No Type C Medicated Feed should be manufactured with less than<br/>
1 g bambermycins/ton. Feed assays for bambermycins with expected levels below 1 g/t may<br/>
not be accurate. See the following table for conversions from mg/hd/day to g/t.</p><h2>Bag Label Image</h2><p class="First">Bag Label Image</p><p></p><p class="ddc-disclaimer-link">Medical Disclaimer</p></body></html>
