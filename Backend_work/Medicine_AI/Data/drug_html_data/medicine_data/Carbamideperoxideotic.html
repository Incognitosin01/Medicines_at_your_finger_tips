Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>Wash your hands before and after using  carbamide peroxide.</p><p>To use the ear drops:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Lie down or tilt your head with your ear facing upward. Open the ear canal by gently pulling your ear back, or pulling downward on the earlobe when giving this medicine to a child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the dropper upside down over your ear and drop the correct number of drops into the ear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may hear a bubbling sound inside your ear. This is caused by the foaming action of carbamide peroxide, which helps break up the wax inside your ear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay lying down or with your head tilted for at least 5 minutes. You may use a small piece of cotton to plug the ear and keep the medicine from draining out. Follow your doctor's instructions about the use of cotton.</p>
