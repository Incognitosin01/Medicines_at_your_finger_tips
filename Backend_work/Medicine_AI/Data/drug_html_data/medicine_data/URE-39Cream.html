Urea also hydrates and gently dissolves the intercellular matrix of the nail plate, which can result in the softening and eventual debridement of the nail plate.</p><h3>PHARMACOKINETICS</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of topically applied Urea is not yet known.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USES</h2><p class="First">For debridement and promotion of normal healing of hyperkeratotic surface lesions, particularly where healing is retarded by local infection, necrotic tissue, fibrinous or prurient debris or eschar. Urea is useful for the treatment of hyperkeratotic conditions such as dry, rough skin, dermatitis, psoriasis, xerosis, ichthyosis, eczema, keratosis, keratoderma, corns and calluses, as well as damaged, ingrown and devitalized nails.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">URE-39</span> Cream is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the listed ingredients.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">For external use only. Avoid contact with eyes, lips or mucous membranes. Do not use on areas of broken skin.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Stop use and ask a doctor if redness or irritation develops. After applying this medication, wash hands and unaffected areas thoroughly. If swallowed, get medical help or contact Poison Control Center right away. KEEP THIS AND ALL MEDICATION OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.</p><h3>PREGNANCY</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus, however, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, <span class="Bold">URE-39</span> Cream should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>NURSING MOTHERS</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether or not this drug is secreted in human milk. Because many drugs are secreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when <span class="Bold">URE-39</span> Cream is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Transient stinging, burning, itching or irritation may occur and normally disappear on discontinuing the medication.</p><h2>URE-39 - Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Apply <span class="Bold">URE-39</span> Cream to affected skin two to three times per day as needed or as directed by a physician.
