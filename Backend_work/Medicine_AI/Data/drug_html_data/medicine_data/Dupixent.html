<li>
<p>any medicine to treat asthma.</p>

Not all possible drug interactions are listed here.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="faq">Popular FAQ</h2><p>No, Dupixent is not an immunosuppressant or a steroid. Dupixent works by targeting a type of protein called an interleukin, that is involved in inflammation. Dupixent calms an overreactive immune system but it does not suppress the immune system. This leads to fewer and less severe symptoms of chronic inflammatory conditions, such as atopic dermatitis or asthma. Continue reading</p><p>Dupixent is associated with several different eye problems, including conjunctivitis, blepharitis, dry eyes, itchy eyes, and keratitis. The cause of the eye problems is thought to be due to Dupixent blocking interleukin-13 (IL-13), an inflammatory protein that also stimulates the production of goblet cells. Goblet cells are responsible for creating mucus in the eye and ensuring the stability of tears. So when Dupixent blocks IL-13 it also lowers the numbers of epithelial goblet cells leading to eye inflammation and eye problems. Continue reading</p><p>Yes, it does appear that Dupixent can cause joint pain although this is not listed in the product information as a side effect. However, several reports of painful joints, tendinitis, and arthritic-like pain associated with Dupixent use have appeared recently in the literature including a 55-year-old woman with multiple joint and thumb pain, a 38-year-old with severe pain and stiffness in one ankle that progressed to her knees, hips and elbows within days of her first dose, and a 40-year-old with generalized joint pain and morning stiffness. Continue reading</p><p>Yes, it does appear that Dupixent can cause weight gain, although this is not listed as a side effect in the product information. A case series of 12 people prescribed Dupixent reported an average weight gain of 6.1kg over one year – the amount of weight gained ranged from 0.1kg to 18.0kg. Anecdotally, blog sites also report weight gain as a side effect. How Dupixent causes weight gain is not known; however, people should be informed that weight gain may be a possible side effect of Dupixent. Continue reading</p><p>Dupixent is not a cure for eczema; however, it does effectively reduce symptoms in the majority of people prescribed it. Dupixent significantly reduces itching, skin appearance, the frequency of AD flares, sleep, and quality of life in most people. However, there does appear to be a subset of people who only partially respond to Dupixent (partial responders), or who respond initially, and then their symptoms return (non-durable responders).
