Specifically, the use of these agents in combination may cause skin and facial hair to temporarily turn a tan or yellow/orange color. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Erythromycin (Systemic): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Clindamycin (Topical).<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Erythromycin (Topical): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Clindamycin (Topical).<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Isotretinoin (Topical): Benzoyl Peroxide may diminish the therapeutic effect of Isotretinoin (Topical).  Management: Avoid combined use of benzoyl peroxide and topical isotretinoin. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, consider separating application times and monitoring for signs and symptoms of clinical failure of isotretinoin.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents: Clindamycin (Topical) may enhance the neuromuscular-blocking effect of Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified. Also see individual agents.</p><p>&gt;10%:</p><p>Dermatologic: Application site scaling (≤21%), local dryness (≤16%)</p><p>Local: Application site erythema (&lt;31%), local desquamation (2% to 19%), application site itching (≤17%)</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Dermatologic: Stinging of the skin (application site: ≤7%), sunburn (local; 1%)</p><p>Local: Application site burning (≤10%), application site reaction (3%)</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Anaphylaxis, application site irritation, application site pain, contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity reaction, local discoloration, local skin exfoliation, skin rash, urticaria</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Bleaching effects: Benzoyl peroxide may bleach hair, colored fabric, or carpeting.</p><p>• Diarrhea: Systemic absorption may occur after topical use of clindamycin. <i>C. difficile</i>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported and have been observed &gt;2 months postantibiotic treatment. Use of parenteral and systemic clindamycin has resulted in severe colitis (including fatalities). Discontinue drug if significant diarrhea, abdominal cramps, or passage of blood and mucus occurs.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis and allergic reactions have been reported, may occur within minutes to a day or longer, and differ from local skin irritation.</p><p>• Skin irritation: Use concomitant topical acne therapy with caution; cumulative irritancy may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating, or abrasive agents.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Sulfone products: Concomitant use of benzoyl peroxide with sulfone products (eg, dapsone, sulfacetamide) may cause temporary discoloration (yellow/orange) of facial hair and skin. Application of products at separate times during the day or washing off benzoyl peroxide prior to application of other products may avoid skin discoloration (Dubina 2009).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For external use only; not for vaginal or ophthalmic use. Avoid contact with mucous membranes. Inform patients to use skin protection and minimize prolonged exposure to sun and avoid tanning beds or sun lamps.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Topical therapy is preferred for the treatment of acne during pregnancy.
