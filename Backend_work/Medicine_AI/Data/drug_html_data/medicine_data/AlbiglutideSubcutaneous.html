<html><head></head><body><h1>Albiglutide (Subcutaneous)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> albiglutide (al-bi-GLOO-tide)</p><p>Carcinogenicity of albiglutide could not be assessed in rodents, but other glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have caused thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents at clinically relevant exposures. Human relevance of GLP-1 receptor agonist induced C-cell tumors in rodents has not been determined. It is unknown whether albiglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans. Albiglutide is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Counsel patients about the potential risk of MTC with the use of albiglutide and inform them of the symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound monitoring is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

Albiglutide is used together with diet and exercise to help control your blood sugar.</p><p>Albiglutide is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using albiglutide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For albiglutide, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to albiglutide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of albiglutide injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of albiglutide injection in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking albiglutide, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using albiglutide with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of albiglutide</h2><p>When you start using albiglutide, it is very important that you check your blood sugar often, especially before and after meals and at bedtime. This will help lower the chance of having very low blood sugar.</p><p>Albiglutide should come with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>You may take albiglutide with or without food.</p><p>You will be using albiglutide at home. Your doctor will teach you how the injections are to be given. Be sure you understand exactly how the medicine is to be injected.</p><p>Albiglutide is given as a shot under the skin of your stomach, thighs, or upper arm. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas.</p><p>If you use albiglutide with insulin, do not mix them into the same syringe. It is acceptable to inject albiglutide and insulin in the same body area, but the shots should not be right next to each other.</p><p>Allow the medicine to warm at room temperature before you inject it. Use it within 8 hours after it is mixed. If the medicine in the pen has changed color, looks cloudy, or if you see particles in it, do not use it. Do not shake the pen.</p><p>Use a new needle each time you inject your medicine.</p><p>Albiglutide also works best when there is a constant amount in the blood. To help keep the amount constant, do not miss any doses. Also, it is best to use the doses at the same day each week.</p><p>Never share medicine pens with others under any circumstances. It is not safe for one pen to be used for more than one person. Sharing needles or pens can result in transmission of infection.</p><p>Throw away used needles in a hard, closed container that the needles cannot poke through (puncture-resistant). Keep this container away from children and pets.</p><p><i>Follow carefully the special meal plan your doctor gave you</i>. This is the most important part of controlling your condition, and is necessary if the medicine is to work properly. Also, exercise regularly and test for sugar in your blood or urine as directed.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of albiglutide will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of albiglutide. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Missed dose</h3><p>If you miss a dose of albiglutide, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.</p><p>If you miss a dose, use it as soon as possible <i>within 3 days</i> after your missed dose. If you miss a dose <i>by more than 3 days</i>, wait until your next regular weekly dose.</p><h3>Storage</h3><p>Keep out of the reach of children.</p><p>Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.</p><p>Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.</p><p>Store your <i>new, unused</i> medicine pen in the refrigerator, in the original carton, and protect it from light. Do not freeze albiglutide, and do not use the medicine if it has been frozen. You may store the <i>opened</i> medicine pen in the refrigerator, or at room temperature for up to 4 weeks before use.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using albiglutide</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that albiglutide is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>It is very important to carefully follow any instructions from your health care team about:</p><ul>
<li>Alcohol—Drinking alcohol may cause severe low blood sugar. Discuss this with your health care team.</li>
<li>Other medicines—Do not take other medicines during the time you are using albiglutide unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes nonprescription medicines such as aspirin, and medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems.</li>
<li>Counseling—Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Also, diabetic patients may need special counseling about diabetes medicine dosing changes that might occur because of lifestyle changes, such as changes in exercise and diet. Furthermore, counseling on contraception and pregnancy may be needed because of the problems that can occur during pregnancy in patients with diabetes.</li>
<li>Travel—Keep a recent prescription and your medical history with you. Be prepared for an emergency as you would normally. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times.</li>
<li>In case of emergency—There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says that you have diabetes and a list of all of your medicines.</li>
</ul><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have the following symptoms while using albiglutide: a mass in the neck, difficulty with swallowing, hoarseness, or troubled breathing. These may be symptoms of a serious thyroid problem.</p><p>Pancreatitis may occur while you are using albiglutide. Tell your doctor right away if you have sudden and severe stomach pain, chills, constipation, nausea, vomiting, fever, or lightheadedness.</p><p>If you develop a skin rash, hives, or any allergic reaction to albiglutide, stop taking the medicine and check with your doctor as soon as possible.</p><p>Albiglutide does not cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). However, low blood sugar can occur when you use albiglutide with other medicines that can lower blood sugar, such as insulin, metformin, or a sulfonylurea. Low blood sugar also can occur if you delay or miss a meal or snack, exercise more than usual, drink alcohol, or cannot eat because of nausea or vomiting.</p><ul>
<li>Symptoms of low blood sugar include anxiety, behavior change similar to being drunk, blurred vision, cold sweats, confusion, cool, pale skin, difficulty with thinking, drowsiness, excessive hunger, a fast heartbeat, headache (continuing), nausea, nervousness, nightmares, restless sleep, shakiness, slurred speech, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</li>
<li>If symptoms of low blood sugar occur, eat glucose tablets or gel, corn syrup, honey, or sugar cubes; or drink fruit juice, non-diet soft drink, or sugar dissolved in water to relieve the symptoms. Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Glucagon is used in emergency situations when severe symptoms such as seizures (convulsions) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe and needle, and know how to use it. Members of your family also should know how to use it.</li>
</ul><p>Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur if you do not take enough or skip a dose of your antidiabetic medicine, overeat or do not follow your meal plan, have a fever or infection, or do not exercise as much as usual.</p><ul>
<li>Symptoms of high blood sugar include blurred vision, drowsiness, dry mouth, flushed, dry skin, fruit-like breath odor, increased urination (frequency and amount), ketones in the urine, loss of appetite, stomachache, nausea, or vomiting, tiredness, troubled breathing (rapid and deep), unconsciousness, or unusual thirst.</li>
<li>If symptoms of high blood sugar occur, check your blood sugar level and then call your doctor for instructions.</li>
