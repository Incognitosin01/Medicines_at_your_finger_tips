Lorazepam injection is also used as a sedative to help you relax before having surgery.</p><p>Lorazepam injection may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Lorazepam can slow or stop your breathing, especially if you have recently used an opioid medication, alcohol, or other drugs that can slow your breathing.</b></p><p>Your caregivers will watch you for symptoms such as weak or shallow breathing.</p><p>In an emergency, you may not be able to tell caregivers about your health conditions. Make sure any doctor caring for you afterward knows you received this medicine.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>If possible before you receive lorazepam injection, tell your doctor if you are allergic to any drugs, or if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>narrow-angle glaucoma;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sleep apnea or severe breathing problem;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a known allergy to polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or benzyl alcohol; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a history of allergic reaction to any benzodiazepine (lorazepam, alprazolam, diazepam, Ativan, Klonopin, Restoril, Tranxene, Valium, Versed, Xanax, and others).</p>

However, status epilepticus is a life-threatening condition and the benefit of receiving lorazepam to treat it may outweigh any risk to the unborn baby.</p><p><b>Sedatives used during surgery may affect brain development in a child under 3, or an unborn baby whose mother receives this medicine during late pregnancy.</b> These effects may be more likely when a sedative is used for 3 hours or longer, or used for repeated procedures. Effects on brain development could cause learning or behavior problems later in life.</p><p>Negative brain effects from sedatives have been seen in animal studies. However, studies in human children receiving single short uses of this medicine have not shown a likely effect on behavior or learning. More research is needed.</p><p>In some cases, your doctor may decide to postpone a surgery based on these risks. Treatment may not be delayed in the case of life-threatening conditions, medical emergencies, or surgery needed to correct certain birth defects.</p><p>Ask your doctor for information about all medicines that will be used during your surgery, and how long the surgery will last.</p><p>In an emergency, you may not be able to tell caregivers if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Make sure any doctor caring for your pregnancy or your baby knows you received this medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is lorazepam injection given?</h2><p>Lorazepam is given as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>You may need to receive only one dose of lorazepam if your condition improves after the medicine is given.</p><p>After the injection, you will be watched to make sure the medicine is working and does not cause harmful side effects.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Because you will receive lorazepam in a clinical setting, you are not likely to miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since this medication is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving lorazepam injection?</h2><p><b>Avoid drinking alcohol within the first 1 or 2 days after you receive lorazepam injection.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><p>Lorazepam can cause extreme drowsiness that may last for 24 to 48 hours after the injection. Older adults may feel sleepy for even longer.</p><p>Avoid driving or hazardous activity until the effects of lorazepam have worn off completely. Dizziness or drowsiness can cause falls, accidents, or severe injuries.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Lorazepam injection side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p><b>Lorazepam can slow or stop your breathing, especially if you have recently used an opioid medication, alcohol, or other drugs that can slow your breathing.</b> Your caregivers will watch you for symptoms such as weak or shallow breathing.</p><p>Tell your caregivers right away if you have:</p><ul>
