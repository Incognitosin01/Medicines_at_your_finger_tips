</ul><p>The Sumycin brand name has been discontinued in the U.S. If generic versions of this product have been approved by the FDA, there may be generic equivalents available.</p><h2>Sumycin Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Tetracycline is a yellow, crystalline powder. Tetracycline is soluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol (96%), practically insoluble in acetone. It dissolves in solutions of alkali hydroxides and carbonates. Solutions in water become turbid on standing, owing to the precipitation of tetracycline. The  chemical  name  for  tetracycline  hydrochloride  is  4-(Dimethylamino)-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12aÂ­octahydro-3,6,10,12,-12a-pentahydroxy-6-methyl-1,11-dioxo-2-naphthacenecar-boxamide monohydrochloride. Its structural formula is as follows:</p><p>Each tablet, for oral administration, contains 250 mg or 500 mg tetracycline hydrochloride.</p><p><span class="Bold">Inactive Ingredients:</span> anhydrous lactose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, pregelatinized starch and stearic acid. The film coating for the 250 mg and 500 mg are made of D&amp;C RED # 30 / helendon pink aluminium lake, hypromellose and titanium dioxide.</p><p>In addition to these, the 250 mg tablet film coating includes triacetin and 500 mg tablet film coating includes polyethylene glycol.</p><h2>Sumycin Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma protein in varying degrees. They are concentrated by the liver in the bile and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations in a biologically active form.</p><p><span class="Bold">Microbiology</span></p><p>Tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Tetracycline is active against a broad range of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The drugs in the tetracycline class have closely similar antimicrobial spectra, and cross-resistance among them is common.</p><p>Tetracycline has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections as described in the <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span> section of the package insert.</p><p><span class="Bold">G</span><span class="Bold">ram-</span><span class="Bold">negative</span><span class="Bold">B</span><span class="Bold">acteria</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics">Acinetobacter</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Bartonella bacilliformis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Brucella</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">C</span><span class="Italics">ampylobacter fetus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Enterobacter aerogenes</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Francisella tularensis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus ducreyi</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Klebsiella</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">K</span><span class="Italics">l</span><span class="Italics">ebsiella granulomatis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">N</span><span class="Italics">eisseria gonorrhoeae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Shigella</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Vibrio cholerae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Y</span><span class="Italics">e</span><span class="Italics">rsinia pestis</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">G</span><span class="Bold">ram-positive Bacteria</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics">Bacillus anthracis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Listeria monocytogenes</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">A</span><span class="Bold">naerobes</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics">Bacteroides</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">C</span><span class="Italics">l</span><span class="Italics">ostridium</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Fusobacterium fusiforme</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes</span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Ot</span><span class="Bold">her Bacteria</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics">Actinomyces</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Borrelia recurrentis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">C</span><span class="Italics">hlamydophila psittaci</span></p><p><span class="Italics">C</span><span class="Italics">hlamydia trachomatis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Rickettsiae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Treponema pallidum</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Treponema pallidum</span> subspecies <span class="Italics">pertenue</span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">P</span><span class="Bold">arasites</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics">Entamoeba</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Balantidium coli</span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Susceptibility Test Methods</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the results of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in resident hospitals to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens.

Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy.  CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drugs. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing use of antibacterial drugs not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> need to be discontinued.

Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and tetracycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.</p><p>Although IH typically resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted.

A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued.</p><p>Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has also been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus.

While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired renal function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia and acidosis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Monitoring for Long-Term Therapy</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>In long-term therapy, perform periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and, if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">As with other antibacterials, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, discontinue antibacterial and institute appropriate therapy.</p><p>Treat all infections due to Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci for at least ten days.</p><p>Perform incision and drainage or other surgical procedures in conjunction with antibacterial therapy, when indicated.</p><p>Prescribing  tetracycline  in  the  absence  of  proven  or  strongly  suspected  bacterial  infection  or  a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including tetracycline should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When tetracycline is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tetracycline or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">In sexually transmitted infections, when coexistent syphilis is suspected, perform dark field examinations before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline in conjunction with penicillin or other bactericidal antibacterials.</p><p>Because the tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.</p><p>The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.</p><p>Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and preparations containing iron, zinc, or sodium bicarbonate.</p><p>Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies are currently being conducted to determine whether tetracycline hydrochloride has carcinogenic potential.  Some related antibacterials (oxytetracycline, minocycline) have shown evidence of oncogenic activity in rats.</p><p>In two <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mammalian cell assay systems (L 51784y mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells), there was evidence of mutagenicity with tetracycline hydrochloride.</p><p>Tetracycline hydrochloride had no effect on fertility when administered in the diet to male and female rats at a daily intake of approximately 400 mg/kg/day, roughly 8 times the highest recommended human dose based on body surface area.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Teratogenic Effects</p><p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category D</span></p><p>(see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>)</p><p>Nonteratogenic Effects</p><p>(see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>)</p><p>Pregnant women with renal disease may be more prone to develop tetracycline-associated liver failure.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Because of potential for serious adverse reaction in nursing infants from tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. </span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal:</span> anorexia, nausea, epigastric distress, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, black hairy tongue, dysphagia, enterocolitis, and inflammatory lesions (with <span class="Italics">Candida</span> overgrowth) in the anogenital region.</p><p>Esophagitis and esophageal ulceration have been reported in patients receiving particularly the capsule and also the tablet forms of tetracyclines.</p><p>Most of the patients were reported to have taken medication immediately before going to bed (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold">Teeth:</span> permanent discoloration of teeth may be caused during tooth development. Enamel hypoplasia has been reported (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin:</span> maculopapular and erythrematous rashes. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported. Onycholysis and discoloration of the nails have been reported. Photosensitivity is discussed in <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Toxicity:</span> an increase in BUN has been reported and is dose related.</p><p><span class="Bold">Liver:</span> hepatotoxicity and liver failure have been observed in patients receiving tetracycline and in tetracycline-treated patients with renal impairment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hypersensitivity Reactions:</span> urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus, and serum sickness-like reactions, as fever, rash, and arthralgia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Blood:</span> hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, neutropenia and eosinophilia have been reported.</p><p>When  given  over  prolonged  periods,  tetracyclines  have  been  reported  to  produce  brown-black microscopic discoloration of thyroid glands. No abnormalities of thyroid function studies are known to occur.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures. Tetracycline is not dialyzable.</p><h2>Sumycin Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Adults: Usual daily dose, 1 gram as 500 mg twice a day or 250 mg four times a day. Higher doses such as 500 mg four times a day may be required for severe infections or for those infections which do not respond to the smaller doses.</p><p>For pediatric patients above eight years of age: Usual daily dose, 10 mg/lb to 20 mg/lb (25 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg) body weight divided in four equal doses.</p><p>Administration of adequate amounts of fluid with the tablet formulation of tetracycline is recommended to wash down the drug and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>).</p><p>Absorption of tetracycline is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and preparations containing iron, zinc or sodium bicarbonate. Food and some dairy products also interfere with absorption.</p><p>When used in streptococcal infections, therapy should be continued for 10 days.</p><p>For treatment of brucellosis, 500 mg tetracycline hydrochloride tablets four times a day for three weeks accompanied by streptomycin, 1 gram intramuscularly twice daily the first week and once daily the second week.</p><p>For the treatment of syphilis in patients allergic to penicillin, the following dosage of tetracycline hydrochloride tablets is recommended: early syphilis (less than one yearâs duration), 500 mg four times a day for 15 days. Syphilis of more than one yearâs duration (except neurosyphilis), 500 mg four times a day for 30 days.</p><p>For treatment of gonorrhea, the recommended dose is 500 mg by mouth four times a day for seven days.</p><p>Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical or rectal infections in adults caused by <span class="Italics">Chlamydiatrachomatis</span>: 500 mg, by mouth, four times a day for at least seven days.</p><p>In cases of moderate to severe acne which, in the judgement of the clinician, require long-term treatment, the recommended initial dosage is 1 gram daily in divided doses. When improvement is noted, reduce dosage gradually to maintenance levels ranging from 125 mg to 500 mg daily. In some patients it may be possible to maintain adequate remission of lesions with alternate day or intermittent therapy. Tetracycline hydrochloride tablets therapy of acne should augment the other standard measures known to be of value. Duration of long-term treatment which can safely be recommended has not been established (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span>).</p><h3>Use in Specific Population</h3><p class="First">In  patients  with  renal  impairment  (see  <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>):  decrease  total  dosage  by  reduction  of recommended individual doses and/or by extending time intervals between doses.</p><h2>How is Sumycin Tablets Supplied</h2><p class="First">Tetracycline Hydrochloride Tablets, USP are available as:</p><p>250 mg: Light pink, ovaloid, coated tablet debossed with â732â on one side and plain on the other side.</p><p>Available in bottles of:</p><p>Bottles of 100            NDC 49884-732-01</p><p>Bottles of 1,000         NDC 49884-732-10</p><p>500 mg: Pink, ovaloid, coated tablet debossed with â733â on one side and plain on the other side.</p><p>Available in bottles of:</p><p>Bottles of 100           NDC 49884-733-01</p><p>Bottles of 500           NDC 49884-733-05</p><p>Dispense in a tight, light-resistant containers as defined in the USP.

This goitrogenic effect was accomplished by high radioactive iodine uptake. Administration of minocycline also produced a large goiter with high radioiodine uptake in rats fed a relatively high iodine diet.</p><p>Treatment of various animal species with this class of drugs has also resulted in the induction of thyroid hyperplasia in the following: in rats and dogs (minocycline), in chickens (chlortetracycline) and in rats and mice (oxytetracycline). Adrenal gland hyperplasia has been observed in goats and rats treated with oxytetracycline.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">Rx only</p><p>Dist. by:</p><p><span class="Bold">Par Pharmaceutical</span></p><p>Chestnut Ridge, NY 10977 U.S.A.</p><p>Mfg. by:</p><p><span class="Bold">Par Formulations Private Limited,</span></p><p>9/215, Pudupakkam, Kelambakkam - 603 103.</p><p>Made in India</p><p>Mfg.
