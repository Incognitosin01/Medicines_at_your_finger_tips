<br/></span> October 30, 2017</p><p>Subject: Temporary importation of Glycophos to address drug shortage issues</p><p>Dear Healthcare Professional,<br/>
<br/>
Due to the critical shortage of phosphate injection in the U.S. market, Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC (Fresenius Kabi USA) is coordinating with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to provide an alternative treatment option during this critical shortage period. Fresenius Kabi USA has initiated temporary importation of a Glycophos<span class="Sup">TM</span> 20 mL Injection Single Dose Plastic Vial into the U.S. market. This product is marketed in Europe, and is manufactured in the Fresenius Kabi Norway plant.</p><p>At this time, no other entity except Fresenius Kabi USA is authorized by the FDA to import or distribute Glycophos<span class="Sup">TM</span> 20 mL Injection Single Dose Plastic Vial in the U.S. FDA has not approved Fresenius Kabi's Glycophos<span class="Sup">TM</span> in the United States.</p><p>Effective immediately, and during this temporary period, Fresenius Kabi USA will offer the following presentation of phosphate injection:</p><p><span class="Bold">The vial and carton labels will display the text used when marketing the product in English speaking countries.<br/></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">It is important to note that there are some key differences in the formulation and labeling<br/>
between the current U.S. marketed phosphate injection products and Glycophos that you need to be aware of:<br/>

<span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Key Differences between U.S. Marketed Phosphate Injection Products and Glycophos</span></span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>At higher concentrations, solutions of calcium and phosphate may<br/>
exist together without precipitating into an insoluble salt complex.</li>
<li>In high pH solutions (admixtures above pH 6.0), organic<br/>
phosphate is less likely to precipitate.</li>

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM<br/></span></p><p>Concentrate for solution for infusion.</p><p><span class="Bold">3.     CLINICAL PARTICULARS<br/></span></p><p><span class="Bold">3.1   Therapeutic indications</span></p><p>Glycophos is indicated in adult patients and infants as a supplement in intravenous nutrition to meet the requirements of phosphate.</p><p><span class="Bold">3.2    Posology and method of administration</span></p><p>Glycophos must not be given undiluted.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Adults:</span></span></p><p>The recommended dosage is individual. The recommended daily dosage of phosphate during intravenous nutrition would normally be 10-20 mmol. This can be met by using 10-20 ml of Glycophos added to the infusion solution or to the admixture for which compatibility has been proved.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Infants:</span></span></p><p>The recommended dosage is individual. The recommended dose for infants and neonates is 1.0-1.5 mmol/Kg body weight/day.</p><p><span class="Bold">3.3    Contra-indications</span></p><p>Glycophos should not be given to patients in a state of dehydration or with hypernatraemia, hyperphosphataemia, severe renal insufficiency or shock.</p><p><span class="Bold">3.4   </span> <span class="Bold">Special warnings and special precautions for use</span></p><p>Glycophos should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function. The phosphate status of all patients should be monitored regularly.</p><p>Glycophos must not be given undiluted.</p><p><span class="Bold">3.5    Interaction with other medicaments and other forms of interaction</span></p><p>No interactions with other drugs have been observed, but a moderate fall in serum phosphate can be seen during carbohydrate infusions.</p><p><span class="Bold">3.6    Pregnancy and lactation</span></p><p>Animal reproduction studies or clinical investigations during pregnancy have not been carried out with Glycophos. However, the requirements of phosphate in a pregnant woman are slightly increased compared to non-pregnant women.</p><p>No adverse events are to be expected when Glycophos is administered during pregnancy.</p><p><span class="Bold">3.7    Effects on ability to drive and use machines</span></p><p>No effects on the ability to drive and use machines are to be expected.</p><p><span class="Bold">3.8    Undesirable effects</span></p><p>No adverse effects related to glycerophosphate have been reported.</p><p><span class="Bold">3.9    Overdose</span></p><p>No adverse effects of an overdose have been reported. Most patients in need of intravenous nutrition have an increased capacity to handle glycerophosphate. See also 3.3 "Contra-indications".</p><p><span class="Bold">4.      PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES</span></p><p><span class="Bold">4.1    Pharmacodynamic properties</span></p><p>Glycerophosphate is a metabolic intermediate in fat metabolism and any pharmacodynamic effects other than maintaining the normal metabolic pathways are unlikely.</p><p><span class="Bold">4.2    Pharmacokinetic properties</span></p><p>To become available it is necessary for the phosphate group to be hydrolysed from the glycerophosphate molecule. The hydrolysis occurs maximally at a plasma concentration of &gt;0.7 mmol/l. Assuming that all hydrolysis of glycerophosphate takes place in plasma, about 12-15 mmol of sodium glycerophosphate will be hydrolysed each day in individuals with normal serum alkaline phosphatase.</p><p>No pharmacokinetical data is available for infants, however with the recommended dosage hyperphosphataemia is unlikely.</p><p><span class="Bold">4.3    Preclinical safety data</span></p><p>Preclinical safety studies on Glycophos demonstrated good tolerance.</p><p><span class="Bold">5.
