</ul><p>Rx only</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CIII</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Description</span></p><p>Each 5 mL (one teaspoonful) for oral administration contains:<br/>
Dihydrocodeine Bitartrate ..... 7.5 mg<br/>
<span class="Bold">(</span><span class="Bold">WARNING- May be habit forming)</span><br/>
Phenylephrine Hydrochloride..... 7.5 mg<br/>
Guaifenesin..... 50 mg</p><p>This product contains the following inactive ingredients: Bitter Mask, FD and C Blue #1, FD and C Red #40,<br/>
Grape Flavor, Propylene Glycol, Purified Water, Sodium Saccharin, Sucrose.</p><p>This product contains ingredients of the following therapeutic classes: Antitussive, Decongestant and<br/>
Expectorant.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Donatuss DC Syrup - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Dihydrocodeine is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic/antitussive related to codeine, with multiple actions<br/>
qualitatively similar to those of codeine: the most prominent of these involve the central nervous system<br/>
and organs with smooth muscle components.</p><p>Phenylephrine hydrochloride affects its vasoconstrictor activity by releasing noradrenaline from sympathetic<br/>
nerve endings, and from direct stimulation of Î±-adrenoreceptos in blood vessels.</p><p>Guaifenesin is an expectorant, which increases respiratory tract fluid secretions and helps to loosen phlegm<br/>
and bronchial secretions. By reducing the viscosity of secretions, guaifenesin increases the efficiency of the<br/>
cough reflex and of ciliary action in removing accumulated secretions from the trachea and bronchi.<br/></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Donatuss DC Syrup</h2><p class="First">This product is indicated for the temporary relief of nasal congestion and dry, non-productive cough associated<br/>
with upper respiratory tract infections and allergies.<br/></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This combination product is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to dihydrocodeine, codeine,<br/>
or any of the active or inactive components listed above, or in any situation where opioids are contraindicated<br/>
including significant respiratory depression (in unmonitored settings or in the absence of resuscitation<br/>
equipment), acute or severe bronchial asthma or hypercapnia, and paralytic ileus. Sympathomimetic agents<br/>
are contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, patients with narrow<br/>
angle glaucoma, bronchial asthma, urinary retention, peptic ulcer, and during an asthmatic attack. This product<br/>
is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.<br/></p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">General:</span> Considerable caution should be exercised in patients with hypertension, diabetes<br/>
mellitus, ischemic heart disease, hyperthyroidism, increased intraocular pressure, and prostatic<br/>
hypertrophy. The elderly (60 years and older) are more likely to exhibit adverse reactions.</p><p><span class="Italics">Usage in Ambulatory Patients:</span> Dihydrocodeine may impair the mental and/or physical abilities<br/>
required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating<br/>
machinery.</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory Depression:</span> Respiratory depression is the most dangerous acute reaction produced<br/>
by opioid agonist preparations, although it is rarely severe with usual doses. Opioids decrease the<br/>
respiratory tidal volume, minute ventilation, and sensitivity to carbon dioxide. Respiratory<br/>
depression occurs most frequently in elderly or debilitated patients, usually after large initial doses<br/>
in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress<br/>
respiration. This combination product should be used with caution in patients with significant chronic<br/>
obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale and in patients with a substantially decreased<br/>
respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or respiratory depression.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hypertensive Effect:</span> Dihydrocodeine, like all opioid analgesics, may cause hypotension in patients<br/>
whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume or who<br/>
received concurrent therapy with drugs such as phenothiazine or other agents which compromise<br/>
vasomotor tone. This product may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. This<br/>
combination product should be administered with caution to patients with circulatory shock since<br/>
vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Dependence:</span> Dihydrocodeine can produce drug dependence of the codeine type and has the potential<br/>
of being abused. This product should be prescribed and administered with the appropriate degree of caution<br/>
(See <span class="Bold">Drug Abuse and Dependence</span> section).<br/></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">General:</span> This combination product should be used with caution in elderly or debiliated<br/>
patients or those with any of the following conditions: adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g.,<br/>
Addison's disease); asthma; central nervous system depression or coma; chronic obstructive<br/>
pulmonary disease; decreased respiratory reserve (including emphysema, severe obesity,<br/>
cor pulmonale, or kyphoscoliosis); delirium tremens; diabetes, head injury; hypotension;<br/>
hypertension; increased intracranial pressure; myxedema or hypothyroidism; prostatic<br/>
hypertrophy or urethral structure; and toxic psychosis. The benefits and risks of opioids in<br/>
patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors and in those with a history of drug abuse should<br/>
be carefully considered. This combination product may aggravate convulsions in patients with<br/>
convulsive disorders, and like all opioids, may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings.<br/></p><h2>Drug Interactions:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">General:</span> Sympathomimetic amines may reduce the antihypertensive effects of methyldopa,<br/>
mecamylamine, reserpine, and veratrum alkaloids.</p><p><span class="Italics">Other CNS Depressants:</span> Patients receiving other opioid analgesics, sedatives or hypnotics,<br/>
muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, centrally acting anti-emetics, phenothiazines or other<br/>
tranquilizers, or alcohol concomitantly with this product may exhibit additive depressant<br/>
effects on the central nervous system. When such combination therapy is contemplated,<br/>
the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. Concomitant use of dihydrocodeine with<br/>
alcohol and other CNS depressants may have an additive effect.</p><p><span class="Italics">Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors:</span> Dihydrocodeine, like all opioids, interact with monoamine oxidase<br/>
inhibitors causing central nervous system excitation and hypertension. MAO inhibitors and<br/>
beta-adrenergic blockers increase the affects of sympathomimetics.<br/></p><h2>Information for Patients:</h2><p class="First">Patients receiving this product should be given the following information:</p><ul>
<li>This product may inhibit mental pr physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery.</li>
<li>Report any adverse experiences occurring during therapy.</li>
<li>Do not adjust the dose of this product without consulting the prescribing professional.</li>
<li>Do not combine this product with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants.</li>
<li>Women of childbearing potential who become, or are planning to become pregnant should be advised to consult their physician regarding the effects of opioids and other drug use during pregnancy on themselves and their unborn child.</li>
</ul><h2>Pregnancy:</h2><h2>Labor and Delivery:</h2><p class="First">This product is not recommended for use by women during and immediately before labor<br/>
and delivery because oral opioids may cause respiratory depression in the newborn.<br/></p><h2>Nursing Mothers:</h2><p class="First">Due to the possible passage of the ingredients into breast milk, this product should not<br/>
be given to nursing mothers.<br/></p><h2>Pediatric Use:</h2><p class="First">This product is not recommended for use in children under six years of age. Children under two years<br/>
may be more susceptible to respiratory arrest, coma, and death. Very young children may be more<br/>
susceptible to the effects, especially the vasopressor effects of sympathomimetic amines. Appropriate<br/>
studies on the relationship of age to the effects of guaifenesin have not been performed in the pediatric<br/>
population. However, no pediatric specific problems have been documented to date.<br/></p><h2>Geriatric Use:</h2><p class="First">This product should be given with caution to the elderly.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment:</span> This product should be given with caution to patients with hepatic insufficiency.<br/>
Since dihydrocodeine is metabolized by the liver the effects of this combination product should be<br/>
monitored closely in such patients.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impariment:</span> This product should be used with caution and at reduced dosage in the presence of<br/>
impaired renal function.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pancreatic/biliary Tract Disease:</span> Opioids may cause spasms of the spinchter of Oddi and should be<br/>
used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including pancreatitis.<br/></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most frequently observed adverse reactions with dihydrocodeine include light-headedness,<br/>
dizziness, drowsiness, headache, fatigue, sedation, sweating, nausea, vomiting, constipation,<br/>
pruritus, and skin reactions. With the exception of constipation, tolerance develops to most of<br/>
these effects. Other reactions that have been observed with dihydrocodeine or opioids include<br/>
respiratory depression, orthostatic hypotension, cough suppression, confusion, diarrhea, miosis,<br/>
abdominal pain, dry mouth, indigestion, anorexia, spasm of biliary tract, and urinary retention.<br/>
Physical and psychological dependence are possibilities. Hypersensitivity reactions (include<br/>
anaphylactoid reactions), hallucinations, vivid dreams, granulomatous interstitial nephritis, severe<br/>
narcosis and acute renal failure have been reported rarely during dihydrocodeine administration.<br/>
Other reactions observed with the ingredients of this product include lassitude, nausea, giddiness,<br/>
dryness of mouth, blurred vision, cardiac palpitations, flushing, increased irritability or excitement<br/>
(especially in children).<br/></p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><p class="First">This combination product is subject to the provisions of the Controlled Substances Act and<br/>
has been placed in Schedule III. Dihydrocodeine can produce drug dependence of the codeine<br/>
type and therefore has the potential of being abused. Psychological dependence, physical<br/>
dependence, and tolerance may develop upon repeat administration of dihydrocodeine, and it<br/>
should be prescribed and administered with the same degree of caution appropriate to the use<br/>
of other opioid medications. Symptoms of dihydrocodeine withdrawal consist of irritability,<br/>
restlessness, insomnia, diaphoresis, anxiety, and palpitations.<br/></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">An overdose of this product is a potentially lethal poly-drug overdose situation, and<br/>
consultation with a regional Poison Control Center is recommended. A listing of the<br/>
Poison Control Centers can be found in a standard reference such as the Physician's<br/>
Desk Reference.</p><p><span class="Bold">Signs and Symptoms:</span><br/>
Symptoms of an overdose include pinpoint pupils, respiratory depression, extreme<br/>
somnolence progressing to stupor, loss of consciousness or coma, skeletal muscle<br/>
flaccidity, cold and clammy skin and other symptoms common with narcotic overdosage.<br/>
Convulsions, cardiovascular collapse, and death may occur. A single case of acute<br/>
rhabdomyolysis associated with an overdose of dihydrocodeine has been reported.</p><p><span class="Bold">Recommended Treatment:</span><br/>
Immediate treatment of an overdose of this product includes support of cardiovascular<br/>
function and measure to reduce further drug absorption. Vomiting should be induced with<br/>
syrup of ipecac. If the patient is alert and has adequate laryngeal reflexes, oral activated<br/>
charcoal should follow. The first dose should be accompanied by an appropriate cathartic.<br/>
Gastric lavage may be necessary. Hypotension is usually hypovolemic and should be<br/>
treated with fluids. Endotracheal intubation and artificial respiration may be necessary.<br/>
The pure opioid antagonist naloxone or nalmexone is a specific antidote against respiratory<br/>
depression that results from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be given in the<br/>
absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid<br/>
overdose. They should be administered cautiously to persons who are known, or suspected<br/>
to be, physically dependent on any opioid agonist including dihydrocodeine. In such cases,<br/>
an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence<br/>
syndrome. The prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist should be consulted<br/>
for details of their proper use.<br/></p><h2>Donatuss DC Syrup Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults and children over 12 years:</span><br/>
