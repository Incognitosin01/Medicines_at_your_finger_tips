</ul><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p class="First">Be certain the dog consumes the entire tablet or tablets. As an alternative to direct dosing, tablets may be offered in food. Watch the dog closely following dosing to be sure the entire dose has been consumed. If it is not entirely consumed, redose once with the full recommended dose as soon as possible.</p><p>Treatment with Program Flavor Tabs may begin at any time of year. In geographic areas where flea infestations are seasonal, the treatment schedule should begin several weeks prior to the expected onset of infestations. Treatments should continue until the end of “flea season.” If there is risk of exposure to fleas year-round, then treatment should continue the entire year without interruption. Ask your veterinarian for details concerning your geographic area and the most effective treatment schedule for your pet.</p><h2>Description</h2><p class="First">The active ingredient of Program Flavor Tabs is lufenuron, a benzoylphenyl-urea derivative classified as an insect development inhibitor (IDI).</p><p>As an insect development inhibitor, Program Flavor Tabs do not kill adult fleas but effectively and safely control flea populations on your pet by breaking the flea’s life cycle at the egg stage.</p><h2>Indications</h2><p class="First">Program Flavor Tabs are labeled for use in dogs and puppies, four weeks of age and older, for the prevention and control of flea populations.</p><p>Lufenuron controls flea populations by preventing the development of flea eggs and does not kill adult fleas. You may also need to use a product that kills adult fleas.</p><p>PROGRAM Flavor Tabs may be used along with CAPSTAR® (nitenpyram) Tablets to provide a Flea Management System that kills adult fleas and prevents flea eggs from hatching. Please see the Supplemental Package Insert provided with this product for information about using the two products together.</p><p><span class="Bold">Without concurrent use of an adulticide, adequate flea control may not be achieved in dogs that have repeated exposure to flea infested animals or environments.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Program Flavor Tabs have no effect on adult fleas but act to immediately break the flea life cycle by preventing eggs from developing into adults. However, pre-existing immature fleas in the dog’s environment may continue to develop and emerge as adults after treatment with Program Flavor Tabs has begun. Based on results of clinical studies, this emergence generally occurs during the first 30-60 days. Therefore, if you pet already has a flea infestation before starting Program Flavor Tabs, noticeable results may not be observed until several weeks after dosing. In cooler climates, immature fleas may take longer to complete the life cycle and emerge as adults.</p><p>To speed control, products that kill adult fleas, like CAPSTAR Tablets may be used temporarily with Program Flavor Tabs, depending on the severity of the infestation. Your veterinarian can recommend the most effective treatment plan for your pet.</p><p>To ensure that your pet gets the greatest benefit from Program Flavor Tabs, you must administer the tablet or tablets once a month in conjunction with a normal meal. If you miss the 30-day interval, give Program Flavor Tabs immediately and resume your monthly dosing schedule. It is important to treat all dogs in the household. Fleas can reproduce on untreated pets and allow infestations to persist. All cats in the household should be treated with an approved product like lufenuron.</p><p>The active ingredient in Program Flavor Tabs is excreted in high concentrations in the milk, however, no resulting adverse effects have been recognized.</p><h2>Flea Infestations on Dogs</h2><p class="First">Although other flea species my be found on dogs, the cat flea (<span class="Italics">Ctenoceph</span><span class="Italics">a</span><span class="Italics">lides felis</span>) is the predominant flea associated with infestations on dogs in the United States. In addition to the common nuisance irritations associated with infestations, fleas can be responsible for medical problems in your pet such as flea allergy dermatitis (FAD), a skin reaction to flea bites. Fleas also transmit other parasites, including tapeworms. Controlling flea infestations is important to your pet’s health while also reducing the major and minor annoyances associated with these parasites.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the flea’s life cycle and where Program Flavor Tabs acts to break this cycle.</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Life Cycle of the Flea</p><p>Fleas can be a problem because they reproduce so rapidly. A single female flea may produce up to 2,000 eggs over her lifetime. Eggs hatch and can develop into adults within only three weeks. Adult female fleas feed by ingesting blood from your dog and subsequently lay eggs that drop off your dog’s coat. Within days, larvae hatch from the eggs and live undetected in your dog’s surroundings, such as the carpet, bedding and other unprotected areas. Flea larvae spin a cocoon, and when appropriately stimulated, a young adult flea emerges and jumps onto your dog to continue the life cycle.</p><p>After biting a Program Flavor Tabs treated dog, the female flea ingests lufenuron which is deposited in her eggs. Lufenuron prevents these flea eggs from developing into mature adults. This safe and convenient approach to flea control effectively breaks the flea’s life cycle and controls flea populations.</p><h2>Dosage</h2><p class="First">Program Flavor Tabs are given orally, once a month at the recommended minimum dosage of 4.5 mg lufenuron per pound (10 mg/kg) of body weight.</p><p>Dogs over 90 lbs. should receive the appropriate combination of tablets.</p><p><span class="Bold">*Please see supplemental insert in this package for concurrent dosing of Program Flavor Tabs and CAPSTAR Tablets.</span></p><h2>Once a Month</h2><p class="First">Program Flavor Tabs will safely and effectively control flea infestations only if administered in conjunction with a normal meal on a monthly dosing schedule. To help you remember the monthly dosing, use the enclosed reminder stickers on the appropriate dates on your calendar.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been reported in dogs after giving Program Flavor Tabs: vomiting, depression/lethargy, pruritus (itchy, scratchy skin), urticaria (wheals, hives), diarrhea, anorexia (loss of appetite), and skin congestion (red skin).</p><h2>How Supplied</h2><p class="First">Program Flavor Tabs are available in four tablet sizes (see Dosage section), formulated according to the weight of the dog. Each tablet size is available in color-coded packages of six tablets each.</p><h2>Storage Conditions</h2><p class="First">Program Flavor Tabs should be stored at room temperature between 59º and 77ºF (15-25ºC).</p><p>Questions?

If a dog currently has a flea infestation, more rapid relief can be accomplished by adding CAPSTAR Tablets to the treatment as follows.</p><h2>Step 2: Kill Adult Fleas</h2><p class="First">If your pet currently has a flea infestation, use CAPSTAR Tablets to kill adult fleas. CAPSTAR Tablets contain nitenpyram and are effective for the treatment of flea infestations. Nitenpyram starts killing adult fleas within 30 minutes of administration.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Administer CAPSTAR Tablets once per week until adult fleas are no longer observed.<br/></li>
<li>For a <span class="Italics">severe</span> flea infestation, administer CAPSTAR Tablets twice per week until adult fleas are no longer observed.<br/></li>
