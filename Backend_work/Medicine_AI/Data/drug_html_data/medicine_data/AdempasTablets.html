Studies establishing effectiveness included predominately patients with WHO functional class II–III and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (61%) or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (25%) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Adempas Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dosage is 1 mg taken 3 times a day. For patients who may not tolerate the hypotensive effect of Adempas, consider a starting dose of 0.5 mg taken three times a day. If systolic blood pressure remains greater than 95 mmHg and the patient has no signs or symptoms of hypotension, up-titrate the dose by 0.5 mg taken three times a day. Dose increases should be no sooner than 2 weeks apart. The dose can be increased to the highest tolerated dosage, up to a maximum of 2.5 mg taken three times a day. If at any time, the patient has symptoms of hypotension, decrease the dosage by 0.5 mg taken three times a day.</p><p class="First">For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Adempas may be crushed and mixed with water or soft foods (such as applesauce) immediately before administration <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Interruption</h3><p class="First">If a dose is missed, advise patients to continue with the next regularly scheduled dose.</p><p>In case Adempas is interrupted for 3 days or more, re-titrate Adempas.</p><h3>Pregnancy Testing in Females of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Obtain pregnancy tests prior to start oftreatment and monthly during treatment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.3</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>Use in Patients who Smoke</h3><p class="First">Consider titrating to dosages higher than 2.5 mg three times a day, if tolerated, in patients who smoke. A dose decrease may be required in patients who stop smoking <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Consider a starting dose of 0.5 mg, three times a day when initiating Adempas in patients receiving strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) and P-glycoprotein/breast cancer resistance protein (P-gp/BCRP) inhibitors such as azole antimycotics (for example, ketoconazole, itraconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (for example, ritonavir). Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension on initiation and on treatment with strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Transitioning to and from Adempas</h3><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Tablets: film-coated, round, bi-convex:</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Based on data from animal reproduction studies, Adempas may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. Adempas was consistently shown to have teratogenic effects when administered to animals. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Nitrates and Nitric Oxide Donors</h3><p class="First">Co-administration of Adempas with nitrates or nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) in any form is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration of Adempas with specific PDE-5 inhibitors (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) or nonspecific PDE 5 inhibitors (such as dipyridamole or theophylline) is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span> Do not administer within 24 hours of sildenafil. Do not administer 24 hours before or within 48 hours after tadalafil.</p><h3>Pulmonary Hypertension Associated with Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias (PH-IIP)</h3><p class="First">Adempas is contraindicated in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (PH-IIP).</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on data from animal reproduction studies, Adempas may cause embryo-fetal toxicity when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Obtain a pregnancy test before the start of treatment, monthly during treatment, and for one month after stopping treatment. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ADEMPAS and for at least one month after the last dose <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]</span>.</p><p>For females, Adempas is only available through a restricted program under the Adempas REMS Program <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Adempas REMS Program</h3><p class="First">Females can only receive Adempas through the Adempas Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program, a restricted distribution program <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><p>Important requirements of the Adempas REMS Program include the following:</p><p>Further information, including a list of certified pharmacies, is available at www.AdempasREMS.com or 1-855-4 ADEMPAS.</p><h3>Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Adempas reduces blood pressure. Consider the potential for symptomatic hypotension or ischemia in patients with hypovolemia, severe left ventricular outflow obstruction, resting hypotension, autonomic dysfunction, or concomitant treatment with antihypertensives or strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Consider a dose reduction if patient develops signs or symptoms of hypotension.</p><h3>Bleeding</h3><p class="First">In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, serious bleeding occurred in 2.4% of patients taking Adempas compared to 0% of placebo patients. Serious hemoptysis occurred in 5 (1%) patients taking Adempas compared to 0 placebo patients, including one event with fatal outcome. Serious hemorrhagic events also included 2 patients with vaginal hemorrhage, 2 with catheter site hemorrhage, and 1 each with subdural hematoma, hematemesis, and intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p><h3>Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease</h3><p class="First">Pulmonary vasodilators may significantly worsen the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). Therefore, administration of Adempas to such patients is not recommended. Should signs of pulmonary edema occur, the possibility of associated PVOD should be considered and, if confirmed, discontinue treatment with Adempas.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety data described below reflect exposure to Adempas in two, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with inoperable or recurrent/persistent CTEPH (CHEST-1) and treatment naive or pre-treated PAH patients (PATENT-1). The population (Adempas: n = 490; Placebo: n = 214) was between the age of 18 and 80 years <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)].</span></p><p>The safety profile of Adempas in patients with inoperable or recurrent/persistent CTEPH (CHEST-1) and treatment naive or pre-treated PAH (PATENT-1) were similar. Therefore, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified from the 12 and 16 week placebo-controlled trials for PAH and CTEPH respectively were pooled, and those occurring more frequently on Adempas than placebo (≥3%) are displayed in Table 1 below. Most adverse reactions in Table 1 can be ascribed to the vasodilatory mechanism of action of Adempas.</p><p>The overall rates of discontinuation due to an adverse event in the pivotal placebo-controlled trials were 2.9% for Adempas and 5.1% for placebo (pooled data).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adempas %</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n=490)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo %</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n=214)</span></p><p class="First">Headache</p><p class="First">27</p><p class="First">18</p><p class="First">Dyspepsia and Gastritis</p><p class="First">21</p><p class="First">8</p><p class="First">Dizziness</p><p class="First">20</p><p class="First">13</p><p class="First">Nausea</p><p class="First">14</p><p class="First">11</p><p class="First">Diarrhea</p><p class="First">12</p><p class="First">8</p><p class="First">Hypotension</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">Vomiting</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">Anemia<br/>

Do not administer 24 hours before or within 48 hours after tadalafil <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].</span> Clinical experience with co-administration of Adempas and other phosphodiesterase inhibitors (for example, milrinone, cilostazole, roflumilast) is limited.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetic Interactions with Adempas</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Smoking:</span> Plasma concentrations in smokers are reduced by 50% to 60% compared to nonsmokers. Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, for patients who are smokers, doses higher than 2.5 mg three times a day may be considered in order to match exposure seen in nonsmoking patients. Safety and effectiveness of Adempas doses higher than 2.5 mg three times a day have not been established. A dose reduction should be considered in patients who stop smoking <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors:</span> Concomitant use of riociguat with strong cytochrome CYP inhibitors and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors such as azole antimycotics (for example, ketoconazole, itraconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (such as ritonavir) increase riociguat exposure and may result in hypotension. Consider a starting dose of 0.5 mg 3 times a day when initiating Adempas in patients receiving strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension on initiation and on treatment with strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors. A dose reduction should be considered in patients who may not tolerate the hypotensive effect of riociguat <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Strong CYP3A inducers:</span> Strong inducers of CYP3A (for example, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may significantly reduce riociguat exposure. Data are not available to guide dosing of riociguat when strong CYP3A inducers are co-administered. <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Antacids:</span> Antacids such as aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide decrease riociguat absorption and should not be taken within 1 hour of taking Adempas <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Based on data from animal reproduction studies, Adempas may cause embryo-fetal toxicity and miscarriage when administered to a pregnant woman and is contraindicated during pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1)]</span>. There are limited available data with ADEMPAS use in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of riociguat to pregnant rats during organogenesis was teratogenic and embryotoxic at exposures approximately 8 times and 2 times, respectively, the human exposure. In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, oral administration of riociguat during organogenesis caused abortions and fetal toxicity at exposures approximately 4 times and 13 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.</p><p class="First">In rats administered riociguat orally (1, 5, and 25 mg/kg/day) throughout organogenesis, an increased rate of cardiac ventricular-septal defect was observed at the highest dose tested. The highest dose produced evidence of maternal toxicity (reduced body weight). Post-implantation loss was statistically significantly increased from the mid-dose of 5 mg/kg/day. Plasma exposure at the lowest dose in which no adverse effects were observed is approximately 0.4 times that in humans at the maximally recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2.5 mg three times a day based on area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) for unbound drug in rat and humans. Plasma exposure at the highest dose (25 mg/kg/day) is approximately 8 times that in humans at the MRHD while exposure at the mid-dose (5 mg/kg/day) is approximately 2 times that in humans at the MRHD. In rabbits given doses of 0.5, 1.5 and 5 mg/kg/day, an increase in spontaneous abortions was observed starting at the middle dose of 1.5 mg/kg, and an increase in resorptions was observed at 5 mg/kg/day. Plasma exposures at these doses were 4 times and 13 times, respectively, the human exposure at the MRHD.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">There are no data on the presence of riociguat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. Riociguat is present in rat milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from ADEMPAS, such as hypotension, in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ADEMPAS.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Female patients of reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to starting treatment with Adempas, monthly during treatment, and one month after discontinuation of treatment with Adempas. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or suspect they may be pregnant. Counsel patients on the risk to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><p class="First">Female patients of reproductive potential must use acceptable methods of contraception during treatment with Adempas and for 1 month after treatment with Adempas. Patients may choose one highly effective form of contraception (intrauterine devices [IUD], contraceptive implants or tubal sterilization) or a combination of methods (hormone method with a barrier method or two barrier methods). If a partner’s vasectomy is the chosen method of contraception, a hormone or barrier method must be used along with this method. Counsel patients on pregnancy planning and prevention, including emergency contraception, or designate counseling by another healthcare provider trained in contraceptive counseling <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning].</span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Adempas in pediatric patients have not been established <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Adempas, 23% were 65 and over, and 6% were 75 and over [see Clinical Studies (14)]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Elderly patients showed a higher exposure to Adempas <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy have not been demonstrated in patients with creatinine clearance &lt;15 mL/min or on dialysis <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy have not been demonstrated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In cases of overdose, blood pressure should be closely monitored and supported as appropriate. Based on extensive plasma protein binding, riociguat is not expected to be dialyzable.</p><h2>Adempas Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Adempas (riociguat) is a tablet for oral administration. Riociguat is methyl 4,6-diamino-2-[1-(2-fluorobenzyl)-1H-pyrazolo [3,4-b]pyridin-3-yl]-5-pyrimidinyl(methyl)carbamate with the following structural formula:</p><p>C<span class="Sub">20</span>H<span class="Sub">19</span>FN<span class="Sub">8</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span></p><p>Riociguat is a white to yellowish, crystalline, non-hygroscopic substance with a molecular weight of 422.42 g/mol. In solid form it is stable to temperature, light, and humidity.</p><p>The solubility at 25°C in water: 4 mg/L, in ethanol: 800 mg/L, in 0.1 HCl (pH 1): 250 mg/L and in buffer (phosphate) pH 7: 3 mg/L. In the pH range of 2 to 4 the solubility showed strong pH-dependency. Solubility increases at lower pH values.</p><p>Each round film-coated tablet contains 0.5 mg (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 mg) riociguat. The inactive ingredients are cellulose microcrystalline, crospovidone, hypromellose 5cP, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, sodium laurylsulfate, hydroxypropylcellulose, hypromellose 3cP, propylene glycol, and titanium dioxide. Adempas 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 mg tablets contain, in addition, ferric oxide yellow. Adempas 2 and 2.5 mg tablets contain, in addition, ferric oxide red..</p><h2>Adempas Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Riociguat is a stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), an enzyme in the cardiopulmonary system and the receptor for nitric oxide (NO).</p><p>When NO binds to sGC, the enzyme catalyzes synthesis of the signaling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Intracellular cGMP plays an important role in regulating processes that influence vascular tone, proliferation, fibrosis and inflammation.</p><p>Pulmonary hypertension is associated with endothelial dysfunction, impaired synthesis of nitric oxide and insufficient stimulation of the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway.</p><p>Riociguat has a dual mode of action. It sensitizes sGC to endogenous NO by stabilizing the NO-sGC binding. Riociguat also directly stimulates sGC via a different binding site, independently of NO.</p><p>Riociguat stimulates the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway and leads to increased generation of cGMP with subsequent vasodilation.</p><p>The active metabolite (M1) of riociguat is 1/3 to 1/10 as potent as riociguat.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">There is a direct relationship between riociguat plasma concentration and hemodynamic parameters such as systemic vascular resistance, systolic blood pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and cardiac output <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>Hemodynamic parameters were assessed in CTEPH patients in CHEST-1 <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>. Right heart catheterization was performed at the beginning and the end of the study period in 233 patients. A statistically significant reduction of PVR (-246 dyn*s*cm<span class="Sup">-5</span>) was shown in the Adempas group vs. placebo.

Formation of the major active metabolite, M1, is catalyzed by CYP1A1, which is inducible by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as those present in cigarette smoke. M1 is further metabolized to the inactive N-glucuronide. Plasma concentrations of M1 in patients with PAH are about half those for riociguat.</p><p>Following oral administration of radiolabeled riociguat in healthy individuals, about 40 and 53% of the total radioactivity was recovered in urine and feces, respectively. There appears to be considerable variability in the proportion of metabolites and unchanged riociguat excreted, but metabolites were the major components of the dose excreted in most individuals.</p><p>Average systemic clearance of riociguat was about 1.8 L/h in patients with PAH and about 3.4 L/h in healthy subjects.
