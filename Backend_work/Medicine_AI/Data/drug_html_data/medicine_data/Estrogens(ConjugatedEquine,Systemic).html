Estrogens are responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Estradiol is the principle intracellular human estrogen and is more potent than estrone and estriol at the receptor level; it is the primary estrogen secreted prior to menopause. Following menopause, estrone and estrone sulfate are more highly produced. Estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone through a negative feedback system; estrogen replacement reduces elevated levels of these hormones in postmenopausal women.</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Well absorbed</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Widely distributes throughout the body; sex hormone target organs contain higher concentrations</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Hepatic via CYP3A4; estradiol is converted to estrone and estriol; estrone is also converted to estriol and is converted to estradiol (<b>Note:</b> A dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions between estrogens exists in the circulation); also undergoes enterohepatic recirculation (avoided with vaginal administration); estrone sulfate is the main metabolite in postmenopausal women</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (primarily estriol, also as estradiol, estrone, and conjugates)</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Total estrone: 7 hours</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Total estrone: 27 hours</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>Binds to sex-hormone-binding globulin and albumin </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Abnormal uterine bleeding (injection only):</b> Treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding due to hormonal imbalance in the absence of organic pathology.</p><p>Limitations of use: For short term use only to provide a rapid and temporary increase in estrogen levels.</p><p><b>Breast cancer, metastatic:</b> Treatment of breast cancer (palliation) in appropriately selected men and postmenopausal women.</p><p><b>Hypoestrogenism (female):</b> Treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure.</p><p><b>Osteoporosis prevention (female):</b> Prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.</p><p>Limitations of use: For use only in women at significant risk of osteoporosis; consider use of nonestrogen medications.</p><p><b>Prostate cancer, advanced:</b> Treatment of androgen-dependent prostatic cancer (palliation).</p><p><b>Vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause:</b> Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.</p><p><b>Vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause:</b> Treatment of moderate to severe vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause.</p><p>Limitations of use: When used solely for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, topical vaginal products should be considered.</p><p><b>Note: </b>The International Society for the Study of Women’s Sexual Health and The North American Menopause Society have endorsed the term genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) as new terminology for vulvovaginal atrophy.

Combined estrogen/progestin therapy is indicated for postmenopausal persons with a uterus to decrease the risk of endometrial cancer. Individuals who have had a hysterectomy generally do not need a progestin; however, one may be needed if there is a history of endometriosis. Adjust dose based on patient response.</p><p><b>Abnormal uterine bleeding:</b> Acute/heavy bleeding: IM, IV: 25 mg, may repeat in 6-12 hours if needed (manufacturer's labeling) <b>or</b> 25 mg IV repeated every 4 to 6 hours for 24 hours (ACOG 557 2013).</p><p><b>Breast cancer, metastatic:</b> Oral: Males and postmenopausal females: 10 mg 3 times/day for at least 3 months</p><p><b>Hypoestrogenism (female) due to castration or primary ovarian failure:</b> Oral: 1.25 mg/day given cyclically*; adjust according to severity of symptoms and patient response. For maintenance, adjust to the lowest effective dose.</p><p><b>Hypoestrogenism (female) due to hypogonadism:</b> Oral: 0.3 or 0.625 mg/day given cyclically*; dose may be titrated in 6- to 12-month intervals; progestin treatment should be added to maintain bone mineral density once skeletal maturity is achieved.</p><p><b>Osteoporosis prevention (females):</b> Oral: Initial: 0.3 mg/day cyclically* or daily, depending on medical assessment of patient. Dose may be adjusted based on bone mineral density and clinical response. The lowest effective dose should be used.</p><p><b>Prostate cancer, advanced:</b> Oral: 1.25 to 2.5 mg 3 times/day</p><p><b>Uremic bleeding (off-label use):</b> IV: 0.6 mg/kg/day for 5 days (Heistinger 1990; Livio 1986; Viganò 1988)</p><p><b>Vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause:</b> Oral: Initial: 0.3 mg/day. May be given cyclically* or daily, depending on medical assessment of patient. Adjust dose based on patient's response. The lowest dose that will control symptoms should be used.</p><p><b>Vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause:</b> Oral: Initial: 0.3 mg/day. The lowest dose that will control symptoms should be used. May be given cyclically* or daily, depending on medical assessment of patient. Adjust dose based on patient's response.</p><p><b>*Cyclic administration:</b> Either 3 weeks on, 1 week off <b>or</b> 25 days on, 5 days off</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Women &gt;65 years of age should be assessed for benefits and risks of treatment; possible adjustments to safer lower-dose and/or route of administration should be considered (ACOG 565 2013; NAMS 2017). The Beers Criteria recommends avoiding systemic estrogen therapy in patients ≥65 years of age (independent of diagnosis or condition) (Beers Criteria [AGS 2019]).</p><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) (females): </b>Limited data available: <b>Note:</b> Begin with the lowest available dose and gradually increase. Obtain bone age every 6 months to avoid premature epiphyseal closure. If treatment continues beyond 1 year or breast growth is significant and has plateaued or breakthrough bleeding occurs, add cyclic progesterone. Continue until menstruation has been established, or longer if clinically indicated (Palmert 2012; Santos 2014; Sperling 2014).</p><p>Adolescents: Oral: Initial: 0.3 mg once daily; continue for 6 to 12 months then evaluate serum parameters and adjust accordingly; if a lower dose needed, consider a different estrogen preparation; requirements may change over the course of puberty; duration of therapy variable; once bone age advanced, may consider discontinuation of therapy (patient may continue pubertal advancement on own) (Melmed 2011). <b>Note:</b> Use of other estrogens (eg, estradiol) is preferred; if conjugated estrogens deemed necessary, the transdermal route may be preferred due to observed cardiovascular risks in post-menopausal females with the systemic route (Melmed 2011; Palmert 2012).</p><p><b>Dysfunctional uterine bleeding: </b>Limited data available: Adolescents: IV: 25 mg every 4 to 6 hours for 24 hours (ACOG 557 2013); if patient hemodynamically unstable, may consider doses every 3 to 4 hours for 3 to 4 doses (Sperling 2014)</p><p><b>Hypogonadism, hypoestrogenism (females):</b> Limited data available: <b>Note:</b> Begin with the lowest available dose and gradually increase dose over 2 to 3 years. Obtain bone age every 6 months to avoid premature epiphyseal closure. As puberty progresses, cyclic progesterone will need added (Palmert 2012; Santos 2014; Sperling 2014).</p><p>Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: Oral: Initial: 0.3 mg once daily, titrate at 6 to 12 months intervals to 0.45 mg once daily and then 0.625 mg once daily. After the first 4 to 6 months of therapy or once breakthrough bleeding occurs, estrogen should be switched from continuous to cyclic therapy and administered for the first 21 days of the month in combination with periodic progesterone (Melmed 2011; Palmert 2012). Overall estrogen replacement will be of extended duration and in some cases lifelong; experts suggest transitioning to transdermal estradiol therapy when able. Some experts suggest an initial dose of 0.1625 mg once daily and then titrating upwards every 6 to 12 months (0.3, 0.45, 0.625 mg once daily, respectively); however, an appropriate commercially available dosage form is not available in the US (Palmert 2012). <b>Note:</b> Use of other estrogens (eg, estradiol) is preferred; if conjugated estrogens deemed necessary, the transdermal route may be preferred due to observed cardiovascular risks in post-menopausal females with the systemic route (Melmed 2011; Norjavaara 2016; Palmert 2012).</p><p><b>Turner syndrome</b>: Limited data available: <b>Note:</b> Estradiol is preferable to initiate hormone replacement therapy in females with Turner syndrome (particularly transdermal route); therapy is initiated around 12 years of age, and slowly increased over 2 to 4 years to adult estrogen levels; once achieved may consider transition to conjugated estrogens although transdermal preferred (Bondy 2007; Gawlik 2016). Adolescents ≥14 years: Usual dose: 1.25 to 2.5 mg once daily; reported range: 0.625 to 2.5 mg; adjust dose based on response and serum parameters (Bondy 2007; Gawlik 2016; Kodama 2012).</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance.

Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.  Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be taken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. </p><p>Estrogen-alone therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen-alone substudy reported increased risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 7.1 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg alone, relative to placebo.</p><p>Estrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women.</p><p>Estrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of dementia. The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of the WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 4 years of treatment with daily conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg), relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women.</p><p>In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of conjugated estrogens (with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate) and other dosage forms of estrogens (with or without progestins). Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical management has been reported within minutes to hours of taking conjugated estrogen (CE) tablets. Angioedema involving the face, feet, hands, larynx, and tongue has also been reported.</p><p>• Breast cancer: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Based on data from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies, an increased risk of invasive breast cancer was observed in postmenopausal women using conjugated estrogens (CE) in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA).</b> Observational studies noted this risk declines once therapy is discontinued. The WHI study did not observe an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women with a hysterectomy using CE alone. The risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal patients on hormone therapy may depend upon type of estrogen and/or progestin, dose, timing of therapy initiation, duration of therapy, route of administration, and individual patient characteristics (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]; NAMS 2017). Hormone therapy may be associated with increased breast density (NAMS 2017); an increase in abnormal mammogram findings requiring further evaluation has been reported with estrogen alone or in combination with progestin therapy. Estrogen use may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases; discontinue estrogen if hypercalcemia occurs.</p><p>• Dementia:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Estrogens with or without progestin should not be used to prevent dementia. In the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), an increased incidence of probable dementia was observed in women ≥65 years of age taking CE alone or in combination with MPA.</b> Because the WHI memory studies were conducted in women ≥65 years of age, it is unknown if these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. However, hormone therapy is not recommended at any age to prevent or treat cognitive decline or dementia (AACE [Goodman 2011]; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Endometrial cancer: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: The use of unopposed estrogen in women with a uterus is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. The addition of a progestin to estrogen therapy may decrease the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, a precursor to endometrial cancer. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling if indicated, should be performed to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding.</b> There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens at equivalent estrogen doses. The risk of endometrial cancer appears to be dose and duration dependent, greatest with use ≥5 years, and may persist following discontinuation of therapy. The use of a progestin is not generally required when low doses of estrogen are used locally for vaginal atrophy, although long term data (&gt;1 year) supporting this recommendation are lacking (NAMS 2013; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Endometriosis: Estrogens may exacerbate endometriosis. Malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants has been reported posthysterectomy with unopposed estrogen therapy. Consider adding a progestin in women with residual endometriosis posthysterectomy.</p><p>• Lipid effects: Estrogen compounds are generally associated with lipid effects such as increased HDL-cholesterol and decreased LDL-cholesterol. Triglycerides may also be increased in women with preexisting hypertriglyceridemia; discontinue if pancreatitis occurs. Use with caution in patients with familial defects of lipoprotein metabolism.</p><p>• Ovarian cancer: Available information related to the use of menopausal estrogen or estrogen/progestin therapy and risk of ovarian cancer is inconsistent. If an association is present, the absolute risk is likely rare and may be influenced by duration of therapy (AACE [Goodman 2011]; ES [Stuenkel 2015]; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Retinal vascular thrombosis: Estrogens may cause retinal vascular thrombosis; discontinue if migraine, loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, or other visual disturbances occur; discontinue permanently if papilledema or retinal vascular lesions are observed on examination.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Asthma: Use caution in patients with asthma; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Carbohydrate intolerance: May impair glucose tolerance; use caution in patients with diabetes. Prior to therapy, consider age, cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in patients previously diagnosed with diabetes (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]).</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Estrogens with or without progestin should not be used to prevent cardiovascular disease. Using data from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies, an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stroke has been reported with CE and an increased risk of DVT, stroke, pulmonary emboli (PE) and myocardial infarction (MI) has been reported with CE with MPA in postmenopausal women 50 to 79 years of age.</b> Additional risk factors include diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, SLE, obesity, tobacco use, and/or history of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Risk factors should be managed appropriately; discontinue use immediately if adverse cardiovascular events occur or are suspected. Due to possible lower risk of thrombotic events, transdermal administration may be preferred for treating vasomotor symptoms of menopause in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]; ACOG 556 2013; ES [Stuenkel 2015]). Use is contraindicated in women with active DVT, PE, arterial thromboembolic disease (stroke and MI), or a history of these conditions.</p><p>• Diseases exacerbated by fluid retention: Use with caution in patients with diseases which may be exacerbated by fluid retention, including cardiac or renal dysfunction.</p><p>• Epilepsy: Use caution with epilepsy; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Gallbladder disease: Use of postmenopausal estrogen may be associated with an increased risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery.</p><p>• Hepatic dysfunction: Estrogens are poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Use caution with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with prior estrogen use or pregnancy. Discontinue if jaundice develops or if acute or chronic hepatic disturbances occur. Use is contraindicated with hepatic impairment or disease.</p><p>• Hepatic hemangiomas: Use with caution in patients with hepatic hemangiomas; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Hereditary angioedema: Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate angioedema symptoms in women with hereditary angioedema.</p><p>• Hypoparathyroidism: Use caution in patients with hypoparathyroidism; estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.</p><p>• Migraine: Use caution with migraine; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Porphyria: Use with caution in patients with porphyria; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• SLE: Use with caution in patients with SLE; may exacerbate disease.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Thyroid replacement therapy: Estrogens may increase thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone while receiving estrogens.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Pediatric: Prior to puberty, estrogens may cause premature closure of the epiphyses. Premature breast development, vaginal bleeding and vaginal cornification may be induced in girls. Modification of the normal puberty process may occur in boys.</p><p>• Surgical patients: Whenever possible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4-6 weeks prior to elective surgery associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism or during periods of prolonged immobilization.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Injection: Although the injection is indicated for short term use only, all warnings and precautions associated with oral administration should be considered.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Duration of use: Extended use of menopausal hormone therapy may be considered for persistent vasomotor symptoms, issues related to quality of life, or for osteoporosis prevention in women at increased risk of fracture. Menopausal hormonal therapy does not need to be routinely discontinued in women &gt;60 years of age and may continue in women &gt;65 years of age after clinical evaluation and discussion of benefits and risks of treatment. Annual exams should be performed with a review of comorbidities; possible adjustments to safer lower-dose and/or route of administration should be discussed (ACOG 565 2013; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Genitourinary syndrome of menopause: Low dose vaginal estrogen is preferred over systemic therapy for GSM in the absence of vasomotor symptoms due to increased efficacy and decreased systemic effects (eg, cardiovascular effects, cancer risk) (Crandall 2018; NAMS 2013; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Laboratory changes: The use of estrogens and/or progestins may change the results of some laboratory tests (eg, coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, binding proteins). The dose, route, and the specific estrogen/progestin influence these changes.</p><p>• Osteoporosis use: In women with premature menopause, hormone therapy to prevent bone loss may be used unless otherwise contraindicated; therapy should be reassessed when the average age of menopause is reached. It is also an appropriate bone-active therapy for women with vasomotor symptoms who are &lt;60 years of age or within 10 years of menopause onset. Use may be considered for women at high risk of fractures who are not candidates for other osteoporosis therapies (NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Risks vs benefits: When used for the relief of menopausal symptoms or increased risk of bone fracture/loss, the benefit-risk of hormone therapy is most favorable if started in patients who have no contraindications to therapy, are &lt;60 years of age, within 10 years of menopause onset, have a favorable lipid profile, and do not have the factor V Leiden genotype or metabolic syndrome. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease should also be considered when evaluating therapy and route of administration (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]; NAMS 2017). <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Estrogens with or without progestin should be used for the shortest duration possible at the lowest effective dose consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.</b> Patients should be reevaluated as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary. Available data related to treatment risks are from Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies, which evaluated oral CE 0.625 mg with or without MPA 2.5 mg relative to placebo in postmenopausal women. Other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins were not studied. <b>Outcomes reported from clinical trials using CE with or without MPA should be assumed to be similar for other doses and other dosage forms of estrogens and progestins until comparable data becomes available.</b></p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Prior to therapy, baseline risk for breast cancer and CVD. During therapy, age appropriate breast and pelvic exams; blood pressure; unscheduled bleeding lasting &gt;6 months for endometrial pathology (sooner in patients who are obese, diabetic, or have a history of endometrial cancer); serum triglycerides (2 weeks after starting therapy in patients with baseline level &gt;200 mg/dL); TSH (6 to 12 weeks after starting oral therapy in patients taking thyroid replacement) (ES [Stuenkel 2015]).</p><p>Menopausal symptoms: Efficacy beginning 1 to 3 months after starting therapy, then every 6 to 12 months as appropriate. Duration of treatment should be evaluated at least annually (ES [Stuenkel 2015]).</p><p><b>Note:</b> Monitoring of FSH and serum estradiol is not useful when managing vasomotor symptoms or GSM.</p><p>Abnormal uterine bleeding: Response to treatment that may be dependent upon etiology of bleed (ACOG 557 2013; Haamid 2017).</p><p>Prevention of osteoporosis: Bone density measurement</p><p>Uremic bleeding: Bleeding time</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Use is contraindicated during pregnancy.</p><p>Estrogens are not indicated for use during pregnancy or immediately postpartum.
