HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Ibalizumab-uiyk injection is used to slow the progression of disease in patients infected with HIV who have advanced symptoms, early symptoms, or no symptoms at all.</p><p>Ibalizumab-uiyk injection will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS, however, it helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of problems that usually result from AIDS or HIV disease. Ibalizumab-uiyk injection will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive ibalizumab-uiyk may continue to have the problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.</p><p>Ibalizumab-uiyk is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using ibalizumab-uiyk</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.

Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>You should not breastfeed if you have HIV or AIDS because you may give the infection to your baby through your breast milk.</p><p>Your immune system may get stronger when you start taking HIV medicines. This could cause a hidden infection in your body to become active. Tell your doctor right away if you notice any changes in your health, including any symptoms of infection (eg, fever, chills, cough, hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination).</p><p>Ibalizumab-uiyk will not keep you from giving HIV to your partner during sex.
