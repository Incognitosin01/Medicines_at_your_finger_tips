</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults and Adolescents</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Allergic Rhinitis:</span> In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the desloratadine group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of desloratadine tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with desloratadine tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1.</p><p>The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in desloratadine and placebo-treated patients.</p><p>There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria:</span> In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials of chronic idiopathic urticaria, 211 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine tablets and 205 received placebo. Adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received desloratadine tablets and that were more common with desloratadine than placebo were (rates for desloratadine and placebo, respectively): headache (14%, 13%), nausea (5%, 2%), fatigue (5%, 1%), dizziness (4%, 3%), pharyngitis (3%, 2%), dyspepsia (3%, 1%), and myalgia (3%, 1%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatrics</span></p><p>Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received Desloratadine Oral Solution for 15 days in three placebo-controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1.0 mg once a day.</p><p>In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects.</p><p>In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%).</p><p>In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%).</p><p>In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3.0%, 1.6%), and nausea (3.0%, 0%).</p><p>There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QTc interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event.</p><h3>Post-Marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: tachycardia, palpitations, rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions (such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis), psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures, and elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin, and very rarely, hepatitis.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4</h3><p class="First">In controlled clinical studies co-administration of desloratadine with ketoconazole, erythromycin, or azithromycin resulted in increased plasma concentrations of desloratadine and 3 hydroxydesloratadine, but there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]</span></p><h3>Fluoxetine</h3><p class="First">In controlled clinical studies co-administration of desloratadine with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), resulted in increased plasma concentrations of desloratadine and 3 hydroxydesloratadine, but there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]</span></p><h3>Cimetidine</h3><p class="First">In controlled clinical studies co-administration of desloratadine with cimetidine, a histamine H<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptor antagonist, resulted in increased plasma concentrations of desloratadine and 3 hydroxydesloratadine, but there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]</span></p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C:</span> There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, desloratadine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p>Desloratadine was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits at approximately 210 and 230 times, respectively, the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. An increase in pre-implantation loss and a decreased number of implantations and fetuses were noted, however, in a separate study in female rats at approximately 120 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in pups at approximately 50 times or greater than the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. Desloratadine had no effect on pup development at approximately 7 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. The AUCs in comparison referred to the desloratadine exposure in rabbits and the sum of desloratadine and its metabolites exposures in rats, respectively. <span class="Italics">[See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2).]</span></p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Desloratadine passes into breast milk; therefore, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue desloratadine, taking into account the benefit of the drug to the nursing mother and the possible risk to the child.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of Desloratadine Oral Solution in the pediatric population is based on cross-study comparison of the plasma concentration of desloratadine in adults and pediatric subjects. The safety of Desloratadine Oral Solution has been established in 246 pediatric subjects aged 6 months to 11 years in three placebo-controlled clinical studies. Since the course of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria and the effects of desloratadine are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations, it allows extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The effectiveness of Desloratadine Oral Solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of desloratadine tablets in adults. The safety and effectiveness of Desloratadine Oral Solution has not been demonstrated in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of overdose, consider standard measures to remove any unabsorbed drug. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are not eliminated by hemodialysis.</p><p>Information regarding acute overdosage is limited to experience from post-marketing adverse event reports and from clinical trials conducted during the development of the desloratadine product. In a dose-ranging trial, at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg/day somnolence was reported.</p><p>In another study, no clinically relevant adverse events were reported in normal male and female volunteers who were given single daily doses of desloratadine 45 mg for 10 days <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><p>Lethality occurred in rats at oral doses of 250 mg/kg or greater (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 120 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). The oral median lethal dose in mice was 353 mg/kg (estimated desloratadine exposures were approximately 290 times the human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). No deaths occurred at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg in monkeys (estimated desloratadine exposures were approximately 810 times the human daily oral dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p><h2>Desloratadine Oral Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Desloratadine Oral Solution is a clear, pink to light pink solution containing 0.5 mg/mL desloratadine. It contains the following inactive ingredients: bubble gum flavor, citric acid anhydrous, D&amp;C Red No. 33, noncrystallizing sorbitol solution (70%), propylene glycol, purified water, sodium benzoate, sodium citrate dihydrate, sodium metabisulfite, and sucrose.</p><p>Desloratadine is a white to beige powder that is slightly soluble in water, but very soluble in ethanol and propylene glycol. It has an empirical formula: C<span class="Sub">19</span>H<span class="Sub">19</span>ClN<span class="Sub">2</span> and a molecular weight of 310.8.

Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2-3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Wheal and Flare:</span> Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5-mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5-mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on QT<span class="Sub">c</span>:</span> Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QT<span class="Sub">c</span>) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QT<span class="Sub">c</span> (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption:</span> Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5 mg tablet once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and AUC of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng∙hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC) of desloratadine.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic profile of Desloratadine Oral Solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of Desloratadine Oral Solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg desloratadine tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of Desloratadine Oral Solution.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution:</span> Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism:</span> Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1,462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1,063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with Desloratadine Oral Solution for 15 to 35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination:</span> The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the <span class="Sup">14</span>C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar T<span class="Sub">max</span> and half-life values compared to desloratadine.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Geriatric Subjects:</span> In older subjects (≥65 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of desloratadine tablets, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects ( &lt;65 years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was 33.7 hr in subjects ≥ 65 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Subjects:</span> In subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of Desloratadine Oral Solution containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of Desloratadine Oral Solution containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5-mg desloratadine tablet. However, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of the metabolite (3-hydroxydesloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 times higher for the 5 mg dose of oral solution administered in adults compared to the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC obtained in children 2 to 11 years of age receiving 1.25 to 2.5 mg of Desloratadine Oral Solution.</p><p>A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of Desloratadine Oral Solution containing 1.25 mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg dose of Desloratadine Oral Solution.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renally Impaired:</span> Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51 to 69 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34 to 43 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>), and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) renal impairment or hemodialysis dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, median C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis dependent, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hepatically Impaired:</span> Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36%, and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gender:</span> Female subjects treated for 14 days with desloratadine tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Race:</span> Following 14 days of treatment with desloratadine tablets, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10% reduction in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span> In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pretreatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady-state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. Although increased plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC <span class="Sub">0-24 hrs</span>) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 2), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenicity Studies</span></p><p>The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 30 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures in rats given 10 mg/kg of loratadine were approximately 7 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known.</p><p>In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively, did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors. The estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures in mice at these doses were 12 and 27 times, respectively, the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Genotoxicity Studies</span></p><p>In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay (<span class="Italics">Salmonella/E. coli</span> mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>There was no effect on female fertility in rats at desloratadine doses up to 24 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 130 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). A male specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic testicular changes, occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg in rats (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 45 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). Desloratadine had no effect on fertility in rats at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 8 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose).</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Reproductive Toxicology Studies</span></p><p>Desloratadine was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 48 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 210 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose) or in rabbits at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine exposures were approximately 230 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). In a separate study, an increase in pre-implantation loss and a decreased number of implantations and fetuses were noted in female rats at 24 mg/kg (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 120 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in pups at doses of 9 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 50 times or greater than the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). Desloratadine had no effect on pup development at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 7 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis</h3><p class="First">The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets were evaluated in over 2300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 1838 patients received 2.5 to 20 mg/day of desloratadine in 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of desloratadine 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose-ranging trial, desloratadine 2.5 to 20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%).</p><p>In two 4-week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, desloratadine tablets 5 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This supports the safety of administering desloratadine tablets to adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma.</p><p>Desloratadine tablets 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the Total Symptom Score (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. See Table 3.</p><p>There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of desloratadine tablets 5 mg across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race.</p><h3>Perennial Allergic Rhinitis</h3><p class="First">The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets 5 mg were evaluated in over 1300 patients 12 to 80 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis. A total of 685 patients received 5 mg/day of desloratadine in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States and internationally. In one of these studies desloratadine tablets 5 mg once daily was shown to significantly reduce the Total Symptom Score in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (Table 4).</p><h3>Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria</h3><p class="First">The efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets 5 mg once daily was studied in 416 chronic idiopathic urticaria patients 12 to 84 years of age, of whom 211 received desloratadine. In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of six weeks duration, at the pre-specified one-week primary time point evaluation, desloratadine tablets significantly reduced the severity of pruritus when compared to placebo (Table 5). Secondary endpoints were also evaluated, and during the first week of therapy desloratadine tablets 5 mg reduced the secondary endpoints, "Number of Hives" and the "Size of the Largest Hive," when compared to placebo.</p><p>The clinical safety of Desloratadine Oral Solution was documented in three, 15-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety studies in pediatric subjects with a documented history of allergic rhinitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, or subjects who were candidates for antihistamine therapy. In the first study, 2.5 mg of Desloratadine Oral Solution was administered to 60 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age. The second study evaluated 1.25 mg of Desloratadine Oral Solution administered to 55 pediatric subjects 2 to 5 years of age. In the third study, 1.25 mg of Desloratadine Oral Solution was administered to 65 pediatric subjects 12 to 23 months of age and 1.0 mg of Desloratadine Oral Solution was administered to 66 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 months of age. The results of these studies demonstrated the safety of Desloratadine Oral Solution in pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Desloratadine Oral Solution is a clear, pink to light pink colored solution with characteristic bubble gum odor containing 0.5 mg/mL desloratadine and is available in the following sizes: 4 fl oz (118 mL) NDC 51672-4159-8, 6 fl oz (177 mL) NDC 51672-4159-5, 8 fl oz (237 mL) NDC 51672-4159-1.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Store at 20° to 25° C (68° to 77° F)</span> [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].
