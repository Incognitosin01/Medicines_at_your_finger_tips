When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><p>If anaerobic organisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, appropriate therapy should be administered. Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Therapy with CIPRO may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available appropriate therapy should be continued.</p><p>As with other drugs, some isolates of <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with ciprofloxacin. Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy will provide information not only on the therapeutic effect of the antimicrobial agent but also on the possible emergence of bacterial resistance.</p><h2>Cipro Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Cipro Tablets and Oral Suspension should be administered orally as described in the appropriate Dosage Guidelines tables.</p><h3>Dosage in Adults</h3><p class="First">The determination of dosage and duration for any particular patient must take into consideration the severity and nature of the infection, the susceptibility of the causative microorganism, the integrity of the patient’s host-defense mechanisms, and the status of renal and hepatic function.</p><p class="First">4 to 8 weeks</p><p class="First">Patients whose therapy is started with CIPRO IV may be switched to Cipro Tablets or Oral Suspension when clinically indicated at the discretion of the physician (Table 2) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CIPRO Oral Dosage</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Equivalent CIPRO IV Dosage</span></p><p class="First">250 mg Tablet every 12 hours</p><p class="First">200 mg intravenous every 12 hours</p><p class="First">500 mg Tablet every 12 hours</p><p class="First">400 mg intravenous every 12 hours</p><p class="First">750 mg Tablet every 12 hours</p><p class="First">400 mg intravenous every 8 hours</p><h3>Dosage in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">Dosing and initial route of therapy (that is, IV or oral) for cUTI or pyelonephritis should be determined by the severity of the infection. CIPRO should be administered as described in Table 3.</p><p class="First">Complicated Urinary Tract or Pyelonephritis</p><p>(patients from 1 to 17 years of age)</p><p class="First">10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg</p><p>(maximum 750 mg per dose; not to be exceeded even in patients weighing more than 51 kg)</p><p class="First">Every 12 hours</p><p class="First">10–21 days</p><p class="First">Inhalational Anthrax (Post-Exposure)<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">15 mg/kg</p><p>(maximum 500 mg per dose)</p><p class="First">Every 12 hours</p><p class="First">60 days</p><p class="First">Plague<span class="Sup">2,3</span></p><p class="First">15 mg/kg</p><p>(maximum 500 mg per dose)</p><p class="First">Every 8 to 12 hours</p><p class="First">10–21 days</p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion; however, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the biliary system of the liver and through the intestine. These alternative pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment. Nonetheless, some modification of dosage is recommended, particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction. Dosage guidelines for use in patients with renal impairment are shown in Table 4.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Creatinine Clearance (mL/min)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose</span></p><p class="First">&gt; 50</p><p class="First">See Usual Dosage.</p><p class="First">30–50</p><p class="First">250–500 mg every12 hours</p><p class="First">5–29</p><p class="First">250–500 mg every 18 hours</p><p class="First">Patients on hemodialysis or Peritoneal dialysis</p><p class="First">250–500 mg every 24 hours (after dialysis)</p><p>When only the serum creatinine concentration is known, the following formulas may be used to estimate creatinine clearance:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Men</span> - Creatinine clearance (mL/min) = <span class="Bold">Weight (kg) x (140–age)</span></p><p class="First">72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Women</span> - 0.85 x the value calculated for men.</p><p>The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.</p><p>In patients with severe infections and severe renal impairment, a unit dose of 750 mg may be administered at the intervals noted above. Patients should be carefully monitored.</p><p>Pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency were excluded from the clinical trial of cUTI and pyelonephritis. No information is available on dosing adjustments necessary for pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (that is, creatinine clearance of &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Administer CIPRO at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after magnesium/aluminum antacids; polymeric phosphate binders (for example, sevelamer, lanthanum carbonate) or sucralfate; Videx<span class="Sup">®</span> (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder for oral solution; other highly buffered drugs; or other products containing calcium, iron or zinc.</p><p class="First">Concomitant administration of CIPRO with dairy products (like milk or yogurt) or calcium-fortified juices alone should be avoided since decreased absorption is possible; however, CIPRO may be taken with a meal that contains these products.</p><p class="First">Assure adequate hydration of patients receiving CIPRO to prevent the formation of highly concentrated urine. Crystalluria has been reported with quinolones.</p><p>Instruct the patient of the appropriate CIPRO administration <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></p><h3>Directions for Reconstitution of the CIPRO Microcapsules for Oral Suspension</h3><p class="First">CIPRO Oral Suspension is supplied in 5% (5 g ciprofloxacin in 100 mL) and 10% (10 g ciprofloxacin in 100 mL) strengths.

CIPRO Oral Suspension should not be administered through feeding or NG (nasogastric) tubes due to its physical characteristics.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><h3>Tablets</h3><h3>Oral Suspension</h3><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">CIPRO is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin, any member of the quinolone class of antibacterials, or any of the product components <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.7</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>Tizanidine</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration with tizanidine is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy, and Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects (hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion).These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after starting CIPRO. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4)]</span>.</p><p>Discontinue CIPRO immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones.</p><h3>Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur, within hours or days of starting CIPRO, or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy.. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.</p><p>The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue CIPRO immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Peripheral Neuropathy</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of CIPRO and may be irreversible in some patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]</span>.</p><p>Discontinue CIPRO immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness, or other alterations in sensations including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense and vibratory sensation, and/or motor strength in order to minimize the development of an irreversible condition. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].</span></p><h3>Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, have been associated with an increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) effects, including. convulsions, increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri), and toxic psychosis CIPRO may also cause central nervous system (CNS) events including: nervousness, agitation, insomnia, anxiety, nightmares, paranoia, dizziness, confusion, tremors, hallucinations, depression, and psychotic reactions have progressed to suicidal ideations/thoughts and self-injurious behavior such as attempted or completed suicide. These reactions may occur following the first dose. Advise patients receiving CIPRO to inform their healthcare provider immediately if these reactions occur, discontinue the drug, and institute appropriate care. CIPRO, like other fluoroquinolones, is known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold. As with all fluoroquinolones, use CIPRO with caution in epileptic patients and patients with known or suspected CNS disorders that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, previous history of convulsion, reduced cerebral blood flow, altered brain structure, or stroke), or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (for example, certain drug therapy, renal dysfunction). Use CIPRO when the benefits of treatment exceed the risks, since these patients are endangered because of possible undesirable CNS side effects. Cases of status epilepticus have been reported. If seizures occur, discontinue CIPRO <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse reactions, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in patients with myasthenia gravis. Avoid CIPRO in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Other serious and sometimes fatal adverse reactions, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported in patients receiving therapy with quinolones, including CIPRO. These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following:</p><p>Discontinue CIPRO immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and supportive measures instituted <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].</span></p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolone therapy, including CIPRO. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Only a few patients had a history of hypersensitivity reactions. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitation measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, intravenous antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines, and airway management, including intubation, as indicated <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Cases of severe hepatotoxicity, including hepatic necrosis, life-threatening hepatic failure, and fatal events, have been reported with CIPRO. Acute liver injury is rapid in onset (range 1–39 days), and is often associated with hypersensitivity. The pattern of injury can be hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed. Most patients with fatal outcomes were older than 55 years old. In the event of any signs and symptoms of hepatitis (such as anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, or tender abdomen), discontinue treatment immediately.</p><p>There can be a temporary increase in transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, or cholestatic jaundice, especially in patients with previous liver damage, who are treated with CIPRO <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3)].</span></p><h3>Serious Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Theophylline</h3><p class="First">Serious and fatal reactions have been reported in patients receiving concurrent administration of CIPRO and theophylline. These reactions have included cardiac arrest, seizure, status epilepticus, and respiratory failure. Instances of nausea, vomiting, tremor, irritability, or palpitation have also occurred.</p><p>Although similar serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving theophylline alone, the possibility that these reactions may be potentiated by CIPRO cannot be eliminated. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, monitor serum levels of theophylline and adjust dosage as appropriate <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)-</span>associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including CIPRO, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy.CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and institute surgical evaluation as clinically indicated <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Prolongation of the QT Interval</h3><p class="First">Some fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram and cases of arrhythmia. Cases of torsade de pointes have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO.</p><p>Avoid CIPRO in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, risk factors for QT prolongation or torsade de pointes (for example, congenital long QT syndrome, uncorrected electrolyte imbalance, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia and cardiac disease, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, or bradycardia), and patients receiving Class IA antiarrhythmic agents (quinidine, procainamide), or Class III antiarrhythmic agents (amiodarone, sotalol), tricyclic antidepressants, macrolides, and antipsychotics. Elderly patients may also be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].</span></p><h3>Musculoskeletal Disorders in Pediatric Patients and Arthropathic Effects in Animals</h3><p class="First">CIPRO is indicated in pediatric patients (less than 18 years of age) only for cUTI, prevention of inhalational anthrax (post exposure), and plague <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.7, 1.8, 1.11)]</span>. An increased incidence of adverse reactions compared to controls, including reactions related to joints and/or surrounding tissues, has been observed <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>In pre-clinical studies, oral administration of CIPRO caused lameness in immature dogs. Histopathological examination of the weight-bearing joints of these dogs revealed permanent lesions of the cartilage. Related quinolone-class drugs also produce erosions of cartilage of weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].</span></p><h3>Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity</h3><p class="First">Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (for example, burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, “V” area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of quinolones including CIPRO after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, avoid excessive exposure to these sources of light. Discontinue CIPRO if phototoxicity occurs <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing Cipro Tablets and CIPRO Oral Suspension in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>Potential Risks with Concomitant Use of Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 1A2 Enzymes</h3><p class="First">CIPRO is an inhibitor of the hepatic CYP1A2 enzyme pathway. Co-administration of CIPRO and other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 (for example, theophylline, methylxanthines, caffeine, tizanidine, ropinirole, clozapine, olanzapine) results in increased plasma concentrations of the co-administered drug and could lead to clinically significant pharmacodynamic adverse reactions of the co-administered drug <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Interference with Timely Diagnosis of Syphilis</h3><p class="First">CIPRO has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis. Antimicrobial agents used in high dose for short periods of time to treat gonorrhea may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis. Perform a serologic test for syphilis in all patients with gonorrhea at the time of diagnosis.

The duration of therapy was 10 to 21 days (mean duration of treatment was 11 days with a range of 1 to 88 days). A total of 335 ciprofloxacin- and 349 comparator-treated patients were enrolled.</p><p>An Independent Pediatric Safety Committee (IPSC) reviewed all cases of musculoskeletal adverse reactions including abnormal gait or abnormal joint exam (baseline or treatment-emergent). Within 6 weeks of treatment initiation, the rates of musculoskeletal adverse reactions were 9.3% (31/335) in the ciprofloxacin-treated group versus 6% (21/349) in comparator-treated patients. All musculoskeletal adverse reactions occurring by 6 weeks resolved (clinical resolution of signs and symptoms), usually within 30 days of end of treatment. Radiological evaluations were not routinely used to confirm resolution of the adverse reactions. Ciprofloxacin-treated patients were more likely to report more than one adverse reaction and on more than one occasion compared to control patients. The rate of musculoskeletal adverse reactions was consistently higher in the ciprofloxacin group compared to the control group across all age subgroups. At the end of 1 year, the rate of these adverse reactions reported at any time during that period was 13.7% (46/335) in the ciprofloxacin-treated group versus 9.5% (33/349) in the comparator-treated patients (Table 7).</p><p>The incidence rates of neurological adverse reactions within 6 weeks of treatment initiation were 3% (9/335) in the CIPRO group versus 2% (7/349) in the comparator group and included dizziness, nervousness, insomnia, and somnolence.</p><p>In this trial, the overall incidence rates of adverse reactions within 6 weeks of treatment initiation were 41% (138/335) in the ciprofloxacin group versus 31% (109/349) in the comparator group.

Serious adverse reactions were seen in 7.5% (25/335) of ciprofloxacin-treated patients compared to 5.7% (20/349) of control patients. Discontinuation of drug due to an adverse reaction was observed in 3% (10/335) of ciprofloxacin-treated patients versus 1.4% (5/349) of comparator patients. Other adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of ciprofloxacin patients were diarrhea 4.8%, vomiting 4.8%, abdominal pain 3.3%, dyspepsia 2.7%, nausea 2.7%, fever 2.1%, asthma 1.8% and rash 1.8%.</p><p>Short-term safety data for ciprofloxacin was also collected in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial for the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis patients (ages 5–17 years). Sixty seven patients received CIPRO IV 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for one week followed by Cipro Tablets 20 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours to complete 10–21 days treatment and 62 patients received the combination of ceftazidime intravenous 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours and tobramycin intravenous 3 mg/kg/dose every8 hours for a total of 10–21 days. Periodic musculoskeletal assessments were conducted by treatment-blinded examiners. Patients were followed for an average of 23 days after completing treatment (range 0–93 days). Musculoskeletal adverse reactions were reported in 22% of the patients in the ciprofloxacin group and 21% in the comparison group. Decreased range of motion was reported in 12% of the subjects in the ciprofloxacin group and 16% in the comparison group. Arthralgia was reported in 10% of the patients in the ciprofloxacin group and 11% in the comparison group. Other adverse reactions were similar in nature and frequency between treatment arms.

CIPRO should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to both fetus and mother. An expert review of published data on experiences with ciprofloxacin use during pregnancy by TERIS–the Teratogen Information System–concluded that therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (quantity and quality of data=fair), but the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk.<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p>A controlled prospective observational study followed 200 women exposed to fluoroquinolones (52.5% exposed to ciprofloxacin and 68% first trimester exposures) during gestation.<span class="Sup">3</span> In utero exposure to fluoroquinolones during embryogenesis was not associated with increased risk of major malformations. The reported rates of major congenital malformations were 2.2% for the fluoroquinolone group and 2.6% for the control group (background incidence of major malformations is 1–5%). Rates of spontaneous abortions, prematurity and low birth weight did not differ between the groups and there were no clinically significant musculoskeletal dysfunctions up to one year of age in the ciprofloxacin exposed children.</p><p>Another prospective follow-up study reported on 549 pregnancies with fluoroquinolone exposure (93% first trimester exposures).<span class="Sup">4</span> There were 70 ciprofloxacin exposures, all within the first trimester. The malformation rates among live-born babies exposed to ciprofloxacin and to fluoroquinolones overall were both within background incidence ranges. No specific patterns of congenital abnormalities were found. The study did not reveal any clear adverse reactions due to in utero exposure to ciprofloxacin.</p><p>No differences in the rates of prematurity, spontaneous abortions, or birth weight were seen in women exposed to ciprofloxacin during pregnancy.<span class="Sup">2, 3</span> However, these small postmarketing epidemiology studies, of which most experience is from short term, first trimester exposure, are insufficient to evaluate the risk for less common defects or to permit reliable and definitive conclusions regarding the safety of ciprofloxacin in pregnant women and their developing fetuses.</p><p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and mice using oral doses up to 100 mg/kg (0.6 and 0.3 times the maximum daily human dose based upon body surface area, respectively) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to ciprofloxacin. In rabbits, oral ciprofloxacin dose levels of 30 and 100 mg/kg (approximately 0.4- and 1.3-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area) produced gastrointestinal toxicity resulting in maternal weight loss and an increased incidence of abortion, but no teratogenicity was observed at either dose level. After intravenous administration of doses up to 20 mg/kg (approximately 0.3-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area), no maternal toxicity was produced and no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is excreted in human milk. The amount of ciprofloxacin absorbed by the nursing infant is unknown. Because of the potential risk of serious adverse reactions (including articular damage) in infants nursing from mothers taking CIPRO, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Although effective in clinical trials, CIPRO is not a drug of first choice in the pediatric population due to an increased incidence of adverse reactions compared to controls.

The risk-benefit assessment indicates that administration of CIPRO to pediatric patients is appropriate <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.8), Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Studies (14.3)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as CIPRO. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing CIPRO to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential adverse reaction and advised to discontinue CIPRO and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur<span class="Italics">. [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><p>In a retrospective analysis of 23 multiple-dose controlled clinical trials of CIPRO encompassing over 3500 ciprofloxacin-treated patients, 25% of patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 10% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using CIPRO with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion; however, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the biliary system of the liver and through the intestine. These alternative pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment. Nonetheless, some modification of dosage is recommended, particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In preliminary studies in patients with stable chronic liver cirrhosis, no significant changes in ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been observed. The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in patients with acute hepatic insufficiency, have not been studied.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of acute overdosage, reversible renal toxicity has been reported in some cases. Empty the stomach by inducing vomiting or by gastric lavage. Observe the patient carefully and give supportive treatment, including monitoring of renal function, urinary pH and acidify, if required, to prevent crystalluria and administration of magnesium, aluminum, or calcium containing antacids which can reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. Adequate hydration must be maintained. Only a small amount of ciprofloxacin (less than 10%) is removed from the body after hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.</p><h2>Cipro Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">CIPRO (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride) Tablets and CIPRO (ciprofloxacin) Oral Suspension are synthetic antimicrobial agents for oral administration.

The overall absorption of CIPRO Tablet or CIPRO Suspension, however, is not substantially affected. The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin given as the suspension are also not affected by food. Avoid concomitant administration of CIPRO with dairy products (like milk or yogurt) or calcium-fortified juices alone since decreased absorption is possible; however, CIPRO may be taken with a meal that contains these products</p><p>With oral administration, a 500 mg dose, given as 10 mL of the 5% CIPRO Suspension (containing 250 mg ciprofloxacin/5mL) is bioequivalent to the 500 mg tablet. A 10 mL volume of the 5% CIPRO Suspension (containing 250 mg ciprofloxacin/5mL) is bioequivalent to a 5 mL volume of the 10% CIPRO Suspension (containing 500 mg ciprofloxacin/5mL).</p><p class="First">The binding of ciprofloxacin to serum proteins is 20% to 40% which is not likely to be high enough to cause significant protein binding interactions with other drugs.</p><p>After oral administration, ciprofloxacin is widely distributed throughout the body. Tissue concentrations often exceed serum concentrations in both men and women, particularly in genital tissue including the prostate. Ciprofloxacin is present in active form in the saliva, nasal and bronchial secretions, mucosa of the sinuses, sputum, skin blister fluid, lymph, peritoneal fluid, bile, and prostatic secretions. Ciprofloxacin has also been detected in lung, skin, fat, muscle, cartilage, and bone. The drug diffuses into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); however, CSF concentrations are generally less than 10% of peak serum concentrations. Low levels of the drug have been detected in the aqueous and vitreous humors of the eye.</p><p class="First">Four metabolites have been identified in human urine which together account for approximately 15% of an oral dose. The metabolites have antimicrobial activity, but are less active than unchanged ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) mediated metabolism. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the co-administered drug <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.9, 5.15), and Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p class="First">The serum elimination half-life in subjects with normal renal function is approximately 4 hours. Approximately 40 to 50% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. After a 250 mg oral dose, urine concentrations of ciprofloxacin usually exceed 200 mcg/mL during the first two hours and are approximately 30 mcg/mL at 8 to 12 hours after dosing. The urinary excretion of ciprofloxacin is virtually complete within 24 hours after dosing. The renal clearance of ciprofloxacin, which is approximately 300 mL/minute, exceeds the normal glomerular filtration rate of 120 mL/minute. Thus, active tubular secretion would seem to play a significant role in its elimination. Co-administration of probenecid with ciprofloxacin results in about a 50% reduction in the ciprofloxacin renal clearance and a 50% increase in its concentration in the systemic circulation.</p><p>Although bile concentrations of ciprofloxacin are several fold higher than serum concentrations after oral dosing, only a small amount of the dose administered is recovered from the bile as unchanged drug. An additional 1% to 2% of the dose is recovered from the bile in the form of metabolites. Approximately 20% to 35% of an oral dose is recovered from the feces within 5 days after dosing. This may arise from either biliary clearance or transintestinal elimination.</p><p class="First">Pharmacokinetic studies of the oral (single dose) and intravenous (single and multiple dose) forms of ciprofloxacin indicate that plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin are higher in elderly subjects (older than 65 years) as compared to young adults. Although the C<span class="Sub">max</span> is increased 16% to 40%, the increase in mean AUC is approximately 30%, and can be at least partially attributed to decreased renal clearance in the elderly.

In a subsequent study in young beagle dogs, oral ciprofloxacin doses of 30 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg ciprofloxacin (approximately 1.3-times and 3.5-times the pediatric dose based upon comparative plasma AUCs) given daily for 2 weeks caused articular changes which were still observed by histopathology after a treatment-free period of 5 months.

In another study, removal of weight bearing from the joint reduced the lesions but did not totally prevent them.</p><p>Crystalluria, sometimes associated with secondary nephropathy, occurs in laboratory animals dosed with ciprofloxacin.

The mean peak serum concentration achieved at steady-state in human adults receiving 500 mg orally every 12 hours is 2.97 mcg/mL, and 4.56 mcg/mL following 400 mg intravenously every 12 hours. The mean trough serum concentration at steady-state for both of these regimens is 0.2 mcg/mL. In a study of 10 pediatric patients between 6 and 16 years of age, the mean peak plasma concentration achieved is 8.3 mcg/mL and trough concentrations range from 0.09 mcg/mL to 0.26 mcg/mL, following two 30-minute intravenous infusions of 10 mg/kg administered 12 hours apart. After the second intravenous infusion patients switched to 15 mg/kg orally every 12 hours achieve a mean peak concentration of 3.6 mcg/mL after the initial oral dose. Long-term safety data, including effects on cartilage, following the administration of CIPRO to pediatric patients are limited. Ciprofloxacin serum concentrations achieved in humans serve as a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and provide the basis for this indication.<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p>A placebo-controlled animal study in rhesus monkeys exposed to an inhaled mean dose of 11 LD<span class="Sub">50</span> (~5.5 x 10<span class="Sup">5</span> spores (range 5–30 LD<span class="Sub">50</span>)of <span class="Italics">B. anthracis</span> was conducted. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin for the anthrax strain used in this study was 0.08 mcg/mL. In the animals studied, mean serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin achieved at expected T<span class="Sub">max</span> (1 hour post-dose) following oral dosing to steady-state ranged from 0.98 mcg/mL to 1.69 mcg/mL. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at 12 hours post-dose ranged from 0.12 mcg/mL to 0.19 mcg/mL.<span class="Sup">10</span> Mortality due to anthrax for animals that received a 30-day regimen of oral ciprofloxacin beginning 24 hours post-exposure was significantly lower (1/9), compared to the placebo group (9/10) [p= 0.001]. The one CIPRO-treated animal that died of anthrax did so following the 30-day drug administration period.<span class="Sup">11</span></p><p>More than 9300 persons were recommended to complete a minimum of 60 days of antibacterial prophylaxis against possible inhalational exposure to <span class="Italics">B. anthracis</span> during 2001. CIPRO was recommended to most of those individuals for all or part of the prophylaxis regimen. Some persons were also given anthrax vaccine or were switched to alternative antibacterial drugs. No one who received CIPRO or other therapies as prophylactic treatment subsequently developed inhalational anthrax. The number of persons who received CIPRO as all or part of their post-exposure prophylaxis regimen is unknown.</p><h3>Plague</h3><p class="First">A placebo-controlled animal study in African green monkeys exposed to an inhaled mean dose of 110 LD<span class="Sub">50</span> (range 92 to 127 LD<span class="Sub">50</span>) of <span class="Italics">Yersinia pestis</span> (CO92 strain) was conducted. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin for the <span class="Italics">Y. pestis</span> strain used in this study was 0.015 mcg/mL. Mean peak serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin achieved at the end of a single 60 minute infusion were 3.49 ± mcg/mL 0.55 mcg/mL, 3.91 mcg/mL ± 0.58 mcg/mL and 4.03 mcg/mL ± 1.22 mcg/mL on Day 2, Day 6 and Day 10 of treatment in African green monkeys, respectively All trough concentrations (Day 2, Day 6 and Day 10) were &lt;0.5 mcg /mL. Animals were randomized to receive either a 10-day regimen of intravenous ciprofloxacin 15 mg/kg, or placebo beginning when animals were found to be febrile (a body temperature greater than 1.5<span class="Sup">o</span>C over baseline for two hours), or at 76 hours post-challenge, whichever occurred sooner. Mortality in the ciprofloxacin group was significantly lower (1/10) compared to the placebo group (2/2) [difference: -90.0%, 95% exact confidence interval: -99.8% to -5.8%]. The one ciprofloxacin-treated animal that died did not receive the proposed dose of ciprofloxacin due to a failure of the administration catheter. Circulating ciprofloxacin concentration was below 0.5 mcg/mL at all timepoints tested in this animal. It became culture negative on Day 2 of treatment, but had a resurgence of low grade bacteremia on Day 6 after treatment initiation. Terminal blood culture in this animal was negative.<span class="Sup">12</span></p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">CIPRO (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride) Tablets are available as round, slightly yellowish film-coated tablets containing 250 mg ciprofloxacin.
