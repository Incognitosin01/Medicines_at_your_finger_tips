</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</span></p><p>The Rajani brand name has been discontinued in the U.S. If generic versions of this product have been approved by the FDA, there may be generic equivalents available.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Rajani</h2><h3>Oral Contraceptive</h3><p class="First">Rajani is indicated for use by women to prevent pregnancy.</p><h3>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)</h3><p class="First">Rajani is also indicated for the treatment of symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in women who choose to use an oral contraceptive as their method of contraception. The effectiveness of Rajani for PMDD when used for more than three menstrual cycles has not been evaluated.</p><p>The essential features of PMDD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-4th edition (DSM-IV) include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, affective lability, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. In this disorder, these symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within a few days following onset of menses; the disturbance markedly interferes with work or school, or with usual social activities and relationships with others. Diagnosis is made by healthcare providers according to DSM-IV criteria, with symptomatology assessed prospectively over at least two menstrual cycles. In making the diagnosis, care should be taken to rule out other cyclical mood disorders.</p><p>Rajani has not been evaluated for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS).</p><h3>Acne</h3><p class="First">Rajani is indicated for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris in women at least 14 years of age, who have no known contraindications to oral contraceptive therapy and have achieved menarche. Rajani should be used for the treatment of acne only if the patient desires an oral contraceptive for birth control.</p><h3>Folate Supplementation</h3><p class="First">Rajani is indicated in women who choose to use an oral contraceptive as their method of contraception, to raise folate levels for the purpose of reducing the risk of a neural tube defect in a pregnancy conceived while taking the product or shortly after discontinuing the product.</p><h2>Rajani Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>How to Take Rajani</h3><p class="First">Take one tablet by mouth at the same time every day. The failure rate may increase when pills are missed or taken incorrectly.</p><p>To achieve maximum contraceptive and PMDD effectiveness, Rajani must be taken as directed, in the order directed on the blister pack. Single missed pills should be taken as soon as remembered.</p><h3>How to Start Rajani</h3><p class="First">Instruct the patient to begin taking Rajani either on the first day of her menstrual period (Day 1 Start) or on the first Sunday after the onset of her menstrual period (Sunday Start).</p><p class="First">During the first cycle of Rajani use, instruct the patient to take one white Rajani tablet daily, beginning on Day 1 of her menstrual cycle. (The first day of menstruation is Day 1.) She should take one white Rajani tablet daily for 24 consecutive days, followed by one light orange tablet daily on Days 25 through 28. Rajani should be taken in the order directed on the package at the same time each day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime with some liquid, as needed. Rajani can be taken without regard to meals. If Rajani is first taken later than the first day of the menstrual cycle, Rajani should not be considered effective as a contraceptive until after the first 7 consecutive days of product administration. Instruct the patient to use a non-hormonal contraceptive as back-up during the first 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.</p><p class="First">During the first cycle of Rajani use, instruct the patient to take one white Rajani tablet daily, beginning on the first Sunday after the onset of her menstrual period. She should take one white Rajani tablet daily for 24 consecutive days, followed by one light orange tablet daily on Days 25 through 28. Rajani should be taken in the order directed on the package at the same time each day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime with some liquid, as needed. Rajani can be taken without regard to meals. Rajani should not be considered effective as a contraceptive until after the first 7 consecutive days of product administration. Instruct the patient to use a non-hormonal contraceptive as back-up during the first 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.</p><p>The patient should begin her next and all subsequent 28-day regimens of Rajani on the same day of the week that she began her first regimen, following the same schedule. She should begin taking her white tablets on the next day after ingestion of the last light orange folate tablet, regardless of whether or not a menstrual period has occurred or is still in progress. Anytime a subsequent cycle of Rajani is started later than the day following administration of the last light orange tablet, the patient should use another method of contraception until she has taken a white Rajani tablet daily for seven consecutive days.</p><p class="First">When switching from another birth control pill, Rajani should be started on the same day that a new pack of the previous oral contraceptive would have been started.</p><p class="First">When switching from a transdermal patch or vaginal ring, Rajani should be started when the next application would have been due. When switching from an injection, Rajani should be started when the next dose would have been due. When switching from an intrauterine contraceptive or an implant, Rajani should be started on the day of removal.</p><p>Withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within 3 days following the last white tablet. If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs while taking Rajani, instruct the patient to continue taking Rajani by the regimen described above. Counsel her that this type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, advise her that if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, she should consult her healthcare provider.</p><p>Although the occurrence of pregnancy is low if Rajani is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Discontinue Rajani if pregnancy is confirmed.</p><p>The risk of pregnancy increases with each active white tablet missed. For additional patient instructions regarding missed pills, see the <span class="Bold">"WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS"</span> section in the <span class="Bold">FDA Approved Patient Labeling</span>. If breakthrough bleeding occurs following missed tablets, it will usually be transient and of no consequence. If the patient misses one or more light orange tablets, she should still be protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking a new cycle of white tablets on the proper day.</p><p>For postpartum women who do not breastfeed or after a second trimester abortion, start Rajani no earlier than 4 weeks postpartum due to the increased risk of thromboembolism. If the patient starts on Rajani postpartum and has not yet had a period, evaluate for possible pregnancy, and instruct her to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken Rajani for 7 consecutive days. </p><h3>Advice in Case of Gastrointestinal Disturbances</h3><p class="First">In case of severe vomiting or diarrhea, absorption may not be complete and additional contraceptive measures should be taken. If vomiting occurs within 3 to 4 hours after tablet-taking, this can be regarded as a missed tablet.</p><h3>Folate Supplementation</h3><p class="First">The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women of childbearing age consume supplemental folic acid in a dose of at least 0.4 mg (400 mcg) daily.<span class="Sup">1</span> Consider other folate supplementation that a woman may be taking before prescribing Rajani. Ensure that folate supplementation is maintained if a woman discontinues Rajani due to pregnancy.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Rajani (drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets) is available in blister packs.  </p><p>Each blister pack (28 film-coated tablets) contains in the following order:  </p><p>• 24 white tablets each containing 3 mg drospirenone (DRSP), 0.02 mg ethinyl estradiol (EE) as betadex clathrate and 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium</p><p>• 4 light orange tablets each containing 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Do not prescribe Rajani to women who are known to have the following:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems</h3><p class="First">Stop Rajani if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs.</p><p>Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, Yasmin*), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of Rajani in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p>A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin* (which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1.</p><p class="First"> <span class="Bold">Epidemiologic Study</span><br/>

Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post- approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: VTE Risk with Yasmin* Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk<span class="Sup">#</span>)</span></p><p>Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio less than 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, greater than 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP.</p><p><span class="Sup">*</span>Comparator “Other COCs”, including LNG- containing COCs</p><p><span class="Sup">†</span>LASS is an extension of the EURAS study</p><p><span class="Sup">#</span>Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic     disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site</p><p>(References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]<span class="Sup">2</span>, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]<span class="Sup">3</span>, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]<span class="Sup">4</span>, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]<span class="Sup">5</span>, Danish re-analysis [ Lidegaard 2011]<span class="Sup">6</span>, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]<span class="Sup">7</span>, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]<span class="Sup">8</span>, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]<span class="Sup">9</span>, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]<span class="Sup">10</span>)</p><p>Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC.</p><p>The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.</p><p>Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE</span></p><p>If feasible, stop Rajani at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism.</p><p>Start Rajani no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.</p><p>Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events.</p><p>COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (greater than 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors.</p><p>Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.</p><p>Stop Rajani if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. <span class="Italics">[See Adverse Reactions (6).]</span></p><h3>Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First">Rajani contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Rajani is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs</h3><p class="First">Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Rajani because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor.</p><p>There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.</p><p>Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</p><h3>Liver Disease</h3><p class="First">Discontinue Rajani if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded.</p><p>Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (greater than 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.</p><p>Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use.</p><h3>Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment</h3><p class="First">During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue Rajani prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Rajani can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.</p><h3>High Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Rajani if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs.</p><p>An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin.</p><h3>Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users.</p><h3>Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</h3><p class="First">Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Rajani. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion.</p><p>Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.</p><p>Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.</p><h3>Headache</h3><p class="First">If a woman taking Rajani develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Rajani if indicated.</p><p>An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC.</p><h3>Bleeding Irregularities</h3><p class="First">Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.</p><p>Data for Rajani show the average number of episodes of bleeding per reference period (90 days) was 3.2 in Cycles 4 to 6. The average number of bleeding and/or spotting days with Rajani was 15.1 days. The intensity of bleeding for Rajani based on the ratio of spotting-only days versus total bleeding and/or spotting days was 5.2/15.1 days.</p><p>Based on patient diaries from two contraceptive clinical trials of *YAZ, 8 to 25% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. A total of 12 subjects out of 1,056 (1.1%) discontinued *YAZ due to menstrual disorders including intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, and metrorrhagia.</p><p>Women who use Rajani may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from*YAZ contraception trials for up to 13 cycles, 6 to 10% of women experienced cycles with no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</p><p>If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.</p><h3>COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Rajani if pregnancy is confirmed and initiate a prenatal vitamin containing folate supplementation.</p><p>The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><h3>Depression</h3><p class="First">Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Rajani discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>.</p><p>DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity.</p><p>Folates may mask vitamin B12 deficiency.</p><h3>Monitoring</h3><p class="First">A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.</p><h3>Other Conditions</h3><p class="First">In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><p>Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: </p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First">The data provided reflect the experience with the use of *YAZ (3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE), in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=1,056), for moderate acne vulgaris (N=536) and folate supplementation (N=379).</p><p>For contraception, a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, open-label study was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy up to one year in 1,027 women aged 17 to 36 who took at least one dose of *YAZ. A second Phase 3 study was a single center, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the effect of 7 28-day cycles of *YAZ on carbohydrate metabolism, lipids and hemostasis in 29 women aged 18 to 35.

Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy.</p><p>The administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy. COCs should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.</p><p>Women who do not breastfeed may start COCs no earlier than four weeks postpartum.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">When possible, advise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception until she has weaned her child. Estrogen-containing COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well-established; however, it can occur at any time in some women. Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites are present in breast milk.</p><p>After oral administration of 3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE tablets (Yasmin**), about 0.02% of the DRSP dose was excreted into the breast milk of postpartum women within 24 hours.

More than 90% of subjects in these studies demonstrated ovulation inhibition. One study compared the effect of 3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE combinations with two different regimens (24-day active tablet period plus 4-day pill-free period vs. 21-day active tablet period plus 7-day pill-free period) on the suppression of ovarian activity during two treatment cycles. During the first treatment cycle, there were no subjects (0/49, 0%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 1 subject (1/50, 2%) using the 21-day regimen. After intentionally introduced dosing errors (3 missed active tablets on Days 1 to 3) during the second treatment cycle, there was 1 subject (1/49, 2%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 4 subjects (4/50, 8%) using the 21-day regimen.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p class="First">Acne vulgaris is a skin condition with a multifactorial etiology including androgen stimulation of sebum production.

The age range was 17 to 36 years. The racial demographic was: 87.8% Caucasian, 4.6% Hispanic, 4.3% Black, 1.2% Asian, and 2.1% other. Women with a BMI greater than 35 were excluded from the trial. The pregnancy rate (Pearl Index) was 1.41 (95% CI [0.73 to 2.47]) per 100 woman-years of use based on 12 pregnancies that occurred after the onset of treatment and within 14 days after the last dose of *YAZ in women 35 years of age or younger during cycles in which no other form of contraception was used.</p><h3>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder Clinical Trials</h3><p class="First">Two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of *YAZ in treating the symptoms of PMDD. Women aged 18 to 42 who met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD, confirmed by prospective daily ratings of their symptoms, were enrolled. Both studies measured the treatment effect of *YAZ using the Daily Record of Severity of Problems scale, a patient-rated instrument that assesses the symptoms that constitute the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. The primary study was a parallel group design that included 384 evaluable reproductive-aged women with PMDD who were randomly assigned to receive *YAZ or placebo treatment for 3 menstrual cycles. The supportive study, a crossover design, was terminated prematurely prior to achieving recruitment goals due to enrollment difficulties. A total of 64 women of reproductive age with PMDD were treated initially with *YAZ or placebo for up to 3 cycles followed by a washout cycle and then crossed over to the alternate medication for 3 cycles.</p><p>Efficacy was assessed in both studies by the change from baseline during treatment using a scoring system based on the first 21 items of the Daily Record of Severity of Problems. Each of the 21 items was rated on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 6 (extreme); thus a maximum score of 126 was possible. In both trials, women who received *YAZ had statistically significantly greater improvement in their Daily Record of Severity of Problems scores. In the primary study, the average decrease (improvement) from baseline was 37.5 points in women taking *YAZ, compared to 30.0 points in women taking placebo.</p><h3>Acne Clinical Trials</h3><p class="First">In two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, 889 subjects, ages 14 to 45 years, with moderate acne received *YAZ or placebo for six 28-day cycles.

<span class="Bold">Do not use Rajani if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old. Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects (heart and blood vessel problems) from birth control pills, including death from heart attack, blood clots or stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke.</span></p><p><br/>
Birth control pills help to lower the chances of becoming pregnant when taken as directed. They do not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. <span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">What is Rajani?</span></p><p>Rajani is a birth control pill. It contains two female hormones, a synthetic estrogen called ethinyl estradiol and a progestin called drospirenone. Rajani also contains levomefolate calcium, which is a B vitamin.</p><p>The progestin drospirenone may increase potassium. Therefore, you should not take Rajani if you have kidney, liver or adrenal disease because this could cause serious heart and health problems. Other drugs may also increase potassium. If you are currently on daily, long-term treatment for a chronic condition with any of the medications below, you should consult your healthcare provider about whether Rajani is right for you, and during the first month that you take Rajani, you should have a blood test to check your potassium level.</p><p>Rajani may also be taken to treat premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) if you choose to use the Pill for birth control. Unless you have already decided to use the Pill for birth control, you should not start Rajani to treat your PMDD because there are other medical therapies for PMDD that do not have the same risks as the Pill. PMDD is a mood disorder related to the menstrual cycle. PMDD significantly interferes with work or school, or with usual social activities and relationships with others. Symptoms include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, mood swings, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD may include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. These symptoms occur regularly before menstruation starts and go away within a few days following the start of the period. Diagnosis of PMDD should be made by healthcare providers.</p><p>You should only use Rajani for treatment of PMDD if you:</p><p>Rajani has not been shown to be effective for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), a less serious set of symptoms occurring before menstruation. If you or your healthcare provider believe you have PMS, you should take Rajani only if you want to prevent pregnancy; and not for the treatment of PMS.</p><p>Rajani may also be taken to treat moderate acne if all of the following are true:</p><p>Rajani may also be taken to provide folate supplementation in women who elect to use an oral contraceptive. It is recommended that women of reproductive age supplement their diet with 0.4 mg (400 mcg) of folic acid daily to lower their risk of having a pregnancy with a rare type of birth defect (known as a neural tube defect). The amount of folate contained in Rajani supplements folate in the diet to lower this risk should you become pregnant while taking the drug or shortly after stopping it. <span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">How Well Does Rajani Work?</span></p><p>Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your birth control pills. The better you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant.</p><p>Based on the results of one clinical study, 1 to 2 women out of 100 women, may get pregnant during the first year they use Rajani.</p><p>The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant.</p><p><span class="Bold">How Do I Take Rajani?</span></p><p>1. <span class="Bold">Be sure to read these directions</span> before you start taking your pills or anytime you are not sure what to do.</p><p>2. The right way to take the pill is to take one pill every day at the same time in the order directed on the package. Preferably, take the pill after the evening meal or at bedtime, with some liquid, as needed. Rajani can be taken without regard to meals.</p><p>If you miss pills you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. See "WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS” below.</p><p>3. Many women have spotting or light bleeding at unexpected times, or may feel sick to their stomach during the first 1-3 packs of pills.</p><p>If you do have spotting or light bleeding or feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If it does not go away, check with your healthcare provider.</p><p>4. Missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you make up these missed pills.</p><p>On the days you take two pills, to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.</p><p>5. If you have vomiting (within 3 to 4 hours after you take your pill), you should follow the instructions for "WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS." If you have diarrhea or if you take certain medicines, including some antibiotics and some herbal products such as St. John's Wort, your pills may not work as well.</p><p>Use a back-up method (such as condoms and spermicides) until you check with your healthcare provider.</p><p>6. If you have trouble remembering to take the pill, talk to your healthcare provider about how to make pill-taking easier or about using another method of birth control.</p><p>7. <span class="Bold">If you have any questions or are unsure about the information in this leaflet, call your healthcare provider.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Before You Start Taking Your Pills</span></p><p>1. Decide What Time of Day You Want to Take Your Pill</p><p>It is important to take Rajani in the order directed on the package at the same time every day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime, with some liquid, as needed. Rajani can be taken without regard to meals.</p><p>2. Look at Your Pill Pack – It has 28 Pills</p><p>The Rajani-pill pack has <span class="Bold">24 white pills</span> (with hormones and folate) to be taken for 24 days, followed by <span class="Bold">4 light orange pills</span> (without hormones, containing folate) to be taken for the next four days. <span class="Bold">It is important to take the light orange pills because they contain folate.</span></p><p>3. Also look for:<br/>
a) Where on the pack to start taking pills,<br/>
b) In what order to take the pills (follow the arrows)</p><p>4. Be sure you have ready at all times (a) another kind of birth control (such as condoms and spermicides) to use as a back-up in case you miss pills, and (b) an extra, full pill pack.</p><p><span class="Bold">When To Start the First Pack of Pills</span></p><p>You have a choice for which day to start taking your first pack of pills. Decide with your healthcare provider which is the best day for you. Pick a time of day which will be easy to remember.</p><p>Day 1 Start:</p><p>1. Take the first white pill of the pack during the first 24 hours of your period.</p><p>2. You will not need to use a back-up method of birth control, since you are starting the Pill at the beginning of your period. However, if you start Rajani later than the first day of your period, you should use another method of birth control (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up method until you have taken 7 white pills.</p><p>Sunday Start:</p><p>1. Take the first white pill of the pack on the Sunday after your period starts, even if you are still bleeding. If your period begins on Sunday, start the pack that same day.</p><p>2. Use another method of birth control (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up method if you have sex anytime from the Sunday you start your first pack until the next Sunday (7 days). This also applies if you start Rajani after having been pregnant, and you have not had a period since your pregnancy.</p><p><span class="Bold">When You Switch From a Different Birth Control Pill</span></p><p>When switching from another birth control pill, Rajani should be started on the same day that a new pack of the previous birth control pill would have been started.</p><p><span class="Bold">When You Switch From Another Type of Birth Control Method</span></p><p>When switching from a transdermal patch or vaginal ring, Rajani should be started when the next application would have been due. When switching from an injection, Rajani should be started when the next dose would have been due. When switching from an intrauterine contraceptive or an implant, Rajani should be started on the day of removal.</p><p><span class="Bold">What to Do During the Month</span></p><p>1. Take one pill at the same time every day until the pack is empty.</p><p>Do not skip pills even if you are spotting or bleeding between monthly periods or feel sick to your stomach (nausea).</p><p>Do not skip pills even if you do not have sex very often.</p><p>2.

However, birth control pills taken by accident during pregnancy are not known to cause birth defects.</p><p>You should stop Rajani at least four weeks before you have major surgery and not restart it until at least two weeks after the surgery due to an increased risk of blood clots.</p><p>If you are breastfeeding, consider another birth control method until you are ready to stop breastfeeding. Birth control pills that contain estrogen, like Rajani, may decrease the amount of milk you make.

This increased risk is highest when you first start taking birth control pills and when you restart the same or different birth control pills after not using them for a month or more. Women who use birth control pills with drospirenone (like Rajani) may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot. Some studies reported that the risk of blood clots was higher for women who use birth control pills that contain drospirenone than for women who use birth control pills that do not contain drospirenone. <span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Talk with your healthcare provider about your risk of getting a blood clot before deciding which birth control pill is right for you. </span></p><p>It is possible to die or be permanently disabled from a problem caused by a blood clot, such as a heart attack or a stroke.</p><p>Some examples of serious clots are blood clots in the:</p><p>To put the risk of developing a blood clot into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use birth control pills are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a blood clot. The figure below shows the likelihood of developing a serious blood clot for women who are not pregnant and do not use birth control pills, for women who use birth control pills, for pregnant women, and for women in the first 12 weeks after delivering a baby.</p><p>Likelihood of Developing a Serious Blood Clot</p><p>A few women who take birth control pills may get:</p><p>All of these events are uncommon in healthy women.</p><p><span class="Bold">Call your healthcare provider right away if you have:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">What are the Common Side Effects of Birth Control Pills?</span></p><p>The most common side effects of birth control pills are:</p><p>These side effects are usually mild and usually disappear with time.</p><p>Less common side effects are:</p><p>This is not a complete list of possible side effects. Talk to your healthcare provider if you develop any side effects that concern you. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.</p><p>No serious problems have been reported from a birth control pill overdose, even when accidentally taken by children.</p><p><span class="Bold">Do Birth Control Pills Cause Cancer?</span></p><p>Birth control pills do not seem to cause breast cancer. However, if you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use birth control pills because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.</p><p>Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.</p><p><span class="Bold">What Should I Know about My Period when Taking Rajani?</span></p><p>Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking Rajani. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle, is unusually heavy, or lasts for more than a few days, call your healthcare provider.</p><p>Some women may not have a menstrual period but this should not be cause for alarm as long as you have taken the pills according to direction.</p><p><span class="Bold">What if I Miss My Scheduled Period when Taking Rajani?</span></p><p>It is not uncommon to miss your period. However, if you miss two periods in a row or miss one period when you have not taken your birth control pills according to directions, call your healthcare provider. Also notify your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. It is important that your healthcare provider checks you to find out if you are pregnant. Stop taking Rajani if you are pregnant.</p><p><span class="Bold">What If I Want to Become Pregnant?</span></p><p>You may stop taking the pill whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking the pill. See your health care provider about appropriate folate supplementation if you stop taking Rajani, are pregnant, or plan on becoming pregnant.</p><p><span class="Bold">General Advice about Rajani</span></p><p>Your healthcare provider prescribed Rajani for you. Please do not share Rajani with anyone else. Keep Rajani out of the reach of children.</p><p>If you have concerns or questions, ask your healthcare provider.
