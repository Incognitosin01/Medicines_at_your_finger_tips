The therapeutic action of sha ren is associated with the fruit or seed. The soft, thin outer surface or peel of the fruit is brownish red and covered with thornlike projections. The flattened pyramid-shaped seeds are firm in texture and average 3 mm in length, often with 4 to 15 seeds in 3 cavities separated by 3 blunt ridges. The fruit has a strong aroma and a pungent, bitter taste.Lawless 1996, Apel 2000, Evans 2002, Reid 1993, Liao 2000</p><h2>History</h2><p>Sha ren has been used commercially and medicinally in China and India for more than 3,000 years. European, Latin American, and Middle Eastern countries have used the plant as a spice. The seeds have been used in liquors, veterinary medicine, cosmetics, perfumes, and as a fragrance in soaps.Lawless 1996, Evans 2002, Bruneton 1995</p><p>Hippocrates recommended sha ren in the treatment of coughs, abdominal pain, nervous disorders, sciatica, retention of urine, and venomous bites. It is considered a carminative and GI aid (eg, enteritis, dysentery, nausea, vomiting). In China, it has been used to stimulate appetite. The <i>British Herbal Pharmacopoeia</i> lists sha ren for the treatment of flatulent dyspepsia.Lawless 1996, Apel 2000, Chopra 1982, Guo 2008</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>The volatile oil of sha ren contains the monoterpenoids borneol, bornyl acetate, camphene, camphor, caryophyllene, limonene, linalool, myrcene, nerolidol, pinene, and terpinene. Borneol and bornyl acetate are the principal terpenoids. The stem of the plant also contains daucosterol and emodin monoglycoside.Lawless 1996, Fan 1994, Lawrence 1970, Lawrence 1972</p><p>Beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, and their epoxides contribute to the seed's aroma, while paradol is responsible for its pungency. Sha ren also contains calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and zinc.Evans 2002, Fan 1994, Lawrence 1970, Lawrence 1972</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Allergic reactions</h3><p>In a murine model, anal administration of sha ren inhibited compound 40/80-induced reactions and histamine release.Kim 2007</p><p>No clinical data exist regarding the use of sha ren for its effects on allergic reactions.</p><h3>Antibacterial effects</h3><p>Sha ren essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation inhibited growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes.Natta 2008</p><p>No clinical data exist regarding the use of sha ren for its antibacterial effects.</p><h3>Antioxidant effects</h3><p>In one study, 16 Chinese medicinal herbs were extracted and prepared as tonic soups to investigate antioxidant activity compared with ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxytoluene. Sha ren was among 3 herbs possessing the highest antioxidant activity as measured in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrozil and ferric reducing antioxidant power assays.Guo 2008</p><p>No clinical data exist regarding the use of sha ren for its antioxidant effects.</p><h3>Diabetes</h3><p>One study investigated the protective effect of sha ren extract against alloxan-induced diabetes in mice. The results indicate that the extract provides a protective effect against nuclear factor kappaB activation, which is considered a primary determinant in the progression of diabetes.Park 2001 In a toxicology study, male rats given 450 and 1,500 mg/kg/day had dose-related decreases in glucose with prolonged treatment; however, effects were not noted in female rats.Ilic 2010</p><p>No clinical data exist regarding the use of sha ren for diabetes.</p><h3>Estrogenic effects</h3><p>The plant extract of sha ren was found to possess estrogenic effects at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL in an in vitro yeast model system.Kang 2006</p><p>No clinical data exists regarding the use of sha ren for its estrogenic effects.</p><h3>Gastritis/Gastric cancer</h3><p>In a murine model, the ethanolic extract of sha ren inhibited ethanol-induced gastric lesion as well as the growth of Helicobacter pylori. The butanol fraction at 350 mg/kg and a subfraction were the most effective at inhibiting gastric lesions, also causing a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability in gastric cancer cell lines.Kim 2007</p><p>Results of a randomized controlled comparator trial in 80 Chinese adults with H. pylori-positive mild to severe chronic gastritis showed comparable and significantly improved clinical efficacy of sha ren-treated patients compared to those treated with triple therapy (amoxicillin, bismuth, tinidazole); 88.1% vs 78.9% treated, respectively (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). Sha ren volatile oil extract was administered orally as 0.5 mL (0.1 g crude drug/mL) 3 times daily. After 4 weeks of therapy, 33% versus 23% of patients were cured with sha ren volatile oil vs triple therapy controls, respectively. H. pylori sero-negative conversion was not significantly different between the 2 groups 76% vs 66%. Analysis of the expression of mastocarcinoma-related peptide (PS2), platelet activating factor, and gastric membrane phospholipids revealed significant improvements with sha ren extract compared to controls (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01 each).Huang 2008</p><h3>Hepatic fibrosis</h3><p>A methanol fraction of A. xanthoides (MFAX) attenuated elevated bilirubin, liver tissue hydroxyproline, and malondialdehyde levels in a rat model of thioacetamide-induced liver fibrosis. Additionally, MFAX attenuated the expression of platelet-derived growth factor-beta, inducible nitric oxid synthase, inducible nitric oxid synthase, and heptocyte growth factor.Wang 2011</p><p>No clinical data exist regarding the use of sha ren for hepatic fibrosis.</p><h3>Obesity/Weight loss</h3><p>In a murine model, sha ren extract as well as 6-paradol, the pungent component of sha ren, activated thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. Additionally, 6-paradol was absorbed in the intestines of rats without desensitization to the effects. Thus, the authors concluded that 6-paradol could be considered a lead molecule for weight loss indications.Iwami 2011</p><p>No clinical data exist regarding the use of sha ren for weight loss effects.</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>There is no clinical evidence to support specific dosage recommendations for sha ren.</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Information regarding adverse reactions with the use of sha ren is limited.</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>In a toxicology study in rats, absolute and relative liver weights increased in a dose-related manner. A subsequent increase in alkaline phosphatase occurred in rats receiving 1,500 mg/kg/day of sha ren on test day 29. There was no steatosis or cirrhosis.Ilic 2010</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
