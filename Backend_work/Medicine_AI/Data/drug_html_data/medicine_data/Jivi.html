If any component of the package is opened or damaged, do not use this component.</p><p class="First">Work on a clean surface and wash hands thoroughly using soap and warm water before performing the procedures.</p><h3>Administration</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For intravenous use only.</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Jivi is available as a white to slightly yellow lyophilized powder in single-use glass vials containing nominally 500, 1000, 2000, or 3000 IU of Factor VIII potency per vial.</p><p>Each vial of Jivi is labeled with actual Factor VIII potency expressed in IU determined using a chromogenic substrate assay. This potency assignment employs a Factor VIII concentrate standard that is referenced to the current WHO International Standard for Factor VIII concentrate, and is evaluated by appropriate methodology to ensure accuracy of the results.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Jivi is contraindicated in patients who have a history of hypersensitivity reactions to the active substance, polyethylene glycol (PEG), mouse or hamster proteins, or other constituents of the product <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions, including severe allergic reactions, have occurred with Jivi. Monitor patients for hypersensitivity symptoms. Early signs of hypersensitivity reactions, which can progress to anaphylaxis, may include chest or throat tightness, dizziness, mild hypotension and nausea. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate treatment.</p><p>Jivi may contain trace amounts of mouse and hamster proteins <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)]</span>. Patients treated with this product may develop hypersensitivity to these non-human mammalian proteins.</p><p>Hypersensitivity reactions may also be related to antibodies against polyethylene glycol (PEG) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Neutralizing Antibodies</h3><p class="First">Neutralizing antibody (inhibitor) formation can occur following administration of Jivi. Carefully monitor patients for the development of Factor VIII inhibitors, using appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If expected plasma Factor VIII activity levels are not attained or if bleeding is not controlled as expected with administered dose, suspect the presence of an inhibitor (neutralizing antibody) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Immune Response to PEG</h3><p class="First">A clinical immune response associated with IgM anti-PEG antibodies, manifested as symptoms of acute hypersensitivity and/or loss of drug effect, has been observed primarily in patients &lt; 6 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>. The symptoms of the clinical immune response were transient. Anti-PEG IgM titers decreased over time to undetectable levels. No immunoglobulin class switching was observed.</p><p>In case of clinical suspicion of loss of drug effect, conduct testing for Factor VIII inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span> and Factor VIII recovery. </p><p>A low post-infusion Factor VIII level in the absence of detectable Factor VIII inhibitors indicates that loss of drug effect is likely due to anti‑PEG antibodies. Discontinue Jivi and switch patients to a previously effective Factor VIII product.</p><h3>Monitoring Laboratory Tests</h3><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most frequently (≥ 5%) reported adverse reactions in clinical trials in previously treated patients (PTPs) ≥ 12 years of age were headache, cough, nausea and fever (see Table 3) .</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>A total of 221 subjects constituted the safety population from three studies. Subjects who received Jivi for perioperative management (n=17) with treatment period of 2 to 3 weeks were excluded from pooled safety analysis but included in analysis for inhibitor development. The median EDs for adults and adolescents (≥ 12 years of age) was 131 EDs (range: 1–309) per subject; and the median EDs for subjects &lt; 12 years of age was 53 EDs (range: 1–68) per subject.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">MedDRA Standard</span></p><p><span class="Bold">System Organ Class</span></p><p>Preferred term</p><p class="First">All Subjects</p><p>n (%)</p><p>n=221</p><p class="First">Subjects ≥12 years of age</p><p>n (%)</p><p>n=148</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Abdominal pain</p><p class="First">9 (4%)</p><p class="First">5 (3%)</p><p class="First">Nausea</p><p class="First">9 (4%)</p><p class="First">8 (5%)</p><p class="First">Vomiting</p><p class="First">10 (5%)</p><p class="First">5 (3%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions</span></p><p class="First">Injection site reactions<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p class="First">4 (2%)</p><p class="First">2 (1%)</p><p class="First">Pyrexia (fever)</p><p class="First">20 (9%)</p><p class="First">8 (5%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Immune System Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Hypersensitivity</p><p class="First">8 (4%)</p><p class="First">3 (2%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nervous System Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Dizziness</p><p class="First">3 (1%)</p><p class="First">3 (2%)</p><p class="First">Dysgeusia (distorted sense of taste)</p><p class="First">1 (1%)</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">Headache</p><p class="First">29 (13%)</p><p class="First">21 (14%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Psychiatric Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Insomnia</p><p class="First">5 (2%)</p><p class="First">4 (3%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Cough</p><p class="First">18 (8%)</p><p class="First">10 (7%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Erythema<span class="Sup">2</span> (redness)</p><p class="First">3 (1%)</p><p class="First">2 (1%)</p><p class="First">Pruritus (itching)</p><p class="First">2 (1%)</p><p class="First">1 (1%)</p><p class="First">Rash<span class="Sup">3</span></p><p class="First">9 (4%)</p><p class="First">3 (2%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vascular Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Flushing</p><p class="First">1 (1%)</p><p class="First">1 (1%)</p><p><span class="Sup">1</span> Includes Injection site pruritus and Injection site rash</p><p><span class="Sup">2</span> Includes Erythema and Erythema multiforme</p><p><span class="Sup">3</span> Includes Rash and Rash papular</p><p class="First">Immunogenicity was evaluated during clinical trials with Jivi in 158 (including surgery subjects) previously treated adult and adolescent (≥ 12 years of age) severe hemophilia A (Factor VIII activity &lt; 1%) subjects with previous exposure to Factor VIII concentrates ≥ 150 EDs. There were 73 previously treated pediatric subjects &lt; 12 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><p class="First">A Factor VIII inhibitor (1.7 BU/mL) was reported in one previously treated adult subject. Repeat testing did not confirm the presence of a Factor VIII inhibitor.</p><p class="First">Immunogenicity against PEG was evaluated by anti-PEG screening and specific IgM anti-PEG ELISA assays. One subject (19 years of age) with asthma, presented at 4 exposure days (EDs) with a clinical hypersensitivity reaction after infusion of Jivi. The subject reported headache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and flushing, all of which resolved following his standard asthma treatment. No further medical intervention was required. The event was associated with a transient increase of IgM anti-PEG antibody titer, which was negative upon retest during follow-up within 30 days.</p><p>The detection of antibody formation depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, it may be misleading to compare the incidence of antibodies to Jivi with the incidence of antibodies to other products.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There are no data with Jivi use in pregnant women to inform on drug-associated risk. Animal developmental and reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with Jivi. It is not known whether Jivi can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">There is no information regarding the presence of Jivi in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Jivi and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Jivi or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness in patients below the age of 12 have not been established.</p><p>Jivi is not indicated for use in previously untreated patients.</p><p>Jivi is not indicated for use in children below 12 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. </p><p>In completed clinical studies with 73 pediatric previously treated patients (PTPs) &lt; 12 years of age (44 PTPs &lt; 6 years, 29 PTPs 6 to &lt; 12 years), adverse reactions due to immune response to PEG were observed in children less than 6 years of age. In 23% of subjects in the age group &lt; 6 years of age, loss of drug effect due to neutralizing anti-PEG IgM antibodies during the first 4 exposure days (EDs) was observed. In 7% of the subjects &lt; 6 years of age, loss of drug effect was combined with hypersensitivity reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Jivi did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease and other drug therapy.</p><h2>Jivi Description</h2><p class="First">Jivi [antihemophilic factor (recombinant), PEGylated-aucl] is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, preservative-free, white to slightly yellow lyophilized powder for reconstitution with sterile Water for Injection (sWFI) as diluent for intravenous (IV) administration. The product is supplied in single-use vials containing dosage strengths of 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 IU in 2.5 mL fill size. For each dosage strength, the actual assayed potency is directly printed on each vial label. The container closure system consists of a 10 mL, Type I glass vial sealed with a bromobutyl grey stopper and an aluminum crimp seal with plastic flip-off cap plus vial adapter. The vial adapter was designed to connect with the sWFI, prefilled diluent syringe. Jivi is formulated with the following excipients: 59 mg glycine, 27 mg sucrose, 8.4 mg histidine, 4.7 mg sodium chloride, 0.7 mg calcium chloride, and 0.216 mg polysorbate 80. The pH of the reconstituted product is 6.6 to 7.0.</p><p>The specific activity of Jivi is approximately 10,000 IU/mg protein.</p><p>The active protein (or starting molecule), prior to conjugation is a recombinant B-domain deleted human coagulation Factor VIII (BDD-rFVIII) produced by recombinant DNA technology in Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells.</p><p>Jivi is produced by site-specific conjugation of the BDD-rFVIII variant K1804C at the cysteine amino acid position 1804 (within the A3 domain) with a single maleimide-derivatized, 60 kilodalton (kDa) branched PEG (two 30 kDa PEG) moiety. The A3 domain was selected for conjugation to provide both a consistent coagulation activity and high PEGylation efficiency.</p><p>The molecular weight of Jivi is approximately 234 kDa based on the calculated average molecular weight of the BDD-rFVIII variant of 165 kDa, plus glycosylation (~4 kDa), and the average molecular weight of the PEG-maleimide of approximately 60 kDa. Functional characterization of Jivi shows comparable mechanism of action to that of rFVIII product with an extended plasma half-life <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]</span>.</p><p>The manufacturing process of Jivi involves propagation of the recombinant production cell line with the harvest isolation process consisting of continuous filtration of tissue culture fluid and anion exchange chromatography on a membrane adsorber capsule. The process intermediate is purified from process- and product-related impurities using a series of chromatography and filtration steps, including 20 nm viral filtration, prior to conjugation to the 60 kDa maleimide PEG moiety. The mono-PEGylated Jivi active molecule is separated from product-related species by chromatography and then formulated by ultrafiltration. The cell culture, PEGylation, purification process and formulation used in the manufacture of Jivi do not use any additives of human or animal origins.</p><h2>Jivi - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Jivi, a site-specifically PEGylated recombinant antihemophilic factor <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)]</span>, temporarily replaces the missing coagulation Factor VIII. The site-specific PEGylation in the A3 domain reduces binding to the physiological Factor VIII clearance receptors resulting in an extended half-life and increased AUC <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The aPTT is prolonged in people with hemophilia A.</p><p>Determination of aPTT is a conventional <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assay for biological activity of Factor VIII. Treatment with Jivi normalizes the aPTT similar to that achieved with plasma-derived Factor VIII. The administration of Jivi increases plasma levels of Factor VIII and can temporarily correct the coagulation defect in hemophilia A patients.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The PK of Jivi was evaluated in two cohorts after single doses of 25 IU/kg and 60 IU/kg and after 25 IU/kg given twice weekly and 60 IU/kg given once weekly for 8 weeks.</p><p>The PK profile obtained at Week 8, after repeated dosing, was comparable with the PK profile obtained after the first dose.</p><p>In Study 1, the PK of Jivi was investigated in 22 previously treated severe Hemophilia A patients (≥ 12 years of age) following administration of a single dose, 60 IU/kg, of Jivi prior to initiation of prophylactic treatment and in 16 subjects after 6 months of prophylaxis treatment with Jivi.

There were 6 non-orthopedic surgeries and 14 orthopedic surgeries (3 arthroplasties, 6 joint replacements, 3 synovectomies, and 2 other joint procedures). Treatment with Jivi provided ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ hemostatic control during all 20 major surgeries. The initial Jivi pre-surgery doses administered ranged between 2500 and 5000 IU. The median total dose per surgery was 219 IU/kg with a median of 35 IU/kg/infusion and a median of 7 infusions per surgery (up to 3 weeks). The median number of infusions on day of surgery was 2 (range 1 – 3).</p><p>An additional 17 minor surgeries were performed in 10 subjects during Part A of Study 1. The adequacy of hemostasis during minor surgeries was assessed as either ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ in all reported cases.</p><h3>Routine Prophylaxis</h3><p class="First">In Study 1, the primary assessment of efficacy was based on 110 subjects who received Jivi for routine prophylaxis during Weeks 10–36 of Part A. Of these, 107 subjects participated in the optional extension phase.</p><p>All (n=110) subjects in the prophylaxis treatment arms began treatment with twice weekly infusions of 25 IU/kg for 10 weeks (run-in phase). After the run-in phase (Weeks 0 – 10), subjects (97 of 110; 88%) who experienced ≤ 1 breakthrough bleeds during the first 10 weeks of treatment qualified for randomization to a less frequent dosing regimen, 86 were randomized 1:1 (n = 43 to either arm) to either every 5 days (45–60 IU/kg) or every 7 days for an additional 26 weeks (Weeks 10–36; 6.5 months) (See Table 7). Dose adjustments were recommended for  randomized subjects who experienced 2 joint and/or muscle bleeds within a 10-week interval during week 10-36 and included the increase of the dose up to 60 IU/kg or  changing to more frequent dosing.</p><p>Twelve percent of subjects (n=13) who experienced ≥ 2 spontaneous bleeds during the 10 week run-in phase were ineligible for randomization and continued on the 2 times per week dosing frequency at a higher dose (30–40 IU/kg) for the additional 26 weeks. Nine of the thirteen subjects were on prior prophylaxis (n=9) and were observed to have a higher mean number of bleeds in the 12 months prior to study entry of 17.4 compared to a mean of 5–7 bleeds for all other patients eligible for randomization to less frequent dosing regimens. The median cumulative number of days in the study (Part A plus extension) was 716 (range: 0 to 952 days) with a median number of 137 EDs (range: 1 to 309 EDs). Prophylaxis dose per treatment regimen is summarized in Table 7.</p><p>In Weeks 10–36 of Part A, the majority [99/110 (90%)] of subjects did not change their treatment regimens. All subjects randomized to the every 5-day regimen (43/43 subjects) or assigned to the 2 times per week regimen (24/24 subjects) remained in their assigned treatment arm until Week 36. Treatment success in the every 7 day arm was not established. For ABR by regimen, see Table 8. During the extension phase of Study 1, the median prophylaxis dose was maintained for the median duration of 1.3 years (range 0.1–1.9 years). </p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Weeks 10–36</span>*of Part <span class="Bold">A</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Subjects per regimen (n)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">2 times per week</span></p><p><span class="Bold">30–40 IU/kg</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Every 5 days</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(45–60 IU/kg)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Eligible</span></p><p><span class="Bold">for randomization</span>†</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ineligible</span></p><p><span class="Bold">for randomization</span>‡</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">n=11</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">n=13</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">n=43</span></p><p class="First">Median prophylaxis dose/infusion (range)</p><p class="First">30.6 IU/kg</p><p>(29–41 IU/kg)</p><p class="First">39.2 IU/kg</p><p>(33–42 IU/kg)</p><p class="First">45.3 IU/kg</p><p>(39–58 IU/kg)</p><p>An analysis compared ABRs between the on-demand group and the different prophylaxis regimens indicated that the ABR was significantly reduced by 88.2% in the every 5-days (p&lt;0.0001) in comparison with on-demand treatment.

Your healthcare provider may also give you Jivi when you have surgery. Jivi can reduce the number of bleeding episodes in adults and adolescents with hemophilia A when used regularly (prophylaxis).</p><p>Jivi is not for use in children &lt; 12 years of age or in previously untreated patients.</p><p>Jivi is not used to treat von Willebrand disease.</p><p><span class="Bold">Who should not use Jivi?</span></p><p>You should not use Jivi if you</p><p><span class="Bold">What should I tell my healthcare provider before I use Jivi?</span></p><p>Tell your healthcare provider about:</p><p><span class="Bold">What are the possible side effects of Jivi?</span></p><p>The common side effects of Jivi are headache, cough, nausea and fever.</p><p>Allergic reactions may occur with Jivi. Call your healthcare provider right away and stop treatment if you get tightness of the chest or throat, dizziness, decrease in blood pressure, or nausea. Allergic reactions to polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of Jivi, are possible.</p><p>Your body can also make antibodies, called “inhibitors”, against Jivi, which may stop Jivi from working properly. Consult with your healthcare provider to make sure you are carefully monitored with blood tests for the development of inhibitors to Factor VIII.</p><p>If your bleeding is not being controlled with your usual dose of Jivi, consult your doctor immediately. You may have developed Factor VIII inhibitors or antibodies to PEG and your doctor may carry out tests to confirm this.</p><p>These are not all the possible side effects with Jivi. You can ask your healthcare provider for information that is written for healthcare professionals.</p><p>Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.</p><p><span class="Bold">What are the Jivi dosage strengths?</span></p><p>Jivi with 2.5 mL Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) comes in four different dosage strengths labeled as International Units (IU): 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU, and 3000 IU.

You should plan to bring enough Jivi for your treatment during this time.</p><p>See the step-by-step instructions below for reconstituting (mixing) Jivi with vial adapter. Follow the specific infusion instruction leaflet included with the infusion set provided.</p><p>Carefully handle Jivi. Dispose of all materials, including any leftover reconstituted Jivi product, in an appropriate container.</p><p>Use only the components for reconstitution and administration that are provided with each package of Jivi. If a package is opened or damaged, do not use this component. If these components cannot be used, please contact your healthcare provider. Gather all the materials needed for the infusion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Reconstitution</span></p><p>Always work on a clean flat surface and wash your hands before performing the following procedures.</p><p class="First">1. Warm the unopened diluent syringe and the concentrate vial to a temperature not to exceed 37°C or 99°F.</p><p class="First">2. Remove protective cap from the vial (A). Aseptically cleanse the rubber stopper with a sterile alcohol swab, being careful not to handle the rubber stopper.</p><p class="First">3. Place product vial on a firm, non-skid surface. Peel off the paper cover on the vial adapter plastic housing. <span class="Bold">Do not remove the adapter from the plastic housing.</span> Holding the adapter housing, place over the product vial and firmly press down (B). The adapter will snap over the vial cap. <span class="Bold">Do not remove the adapter housing at this step.</span></p><p class="First">4. Holding the syringe by the barrel, snap the syringe cap off the tip (C). <span class="Bold">Do not touch the syringe tip with your hand or any surface.</span> Set the syringe aside for further use.</p><p class="First">5. Now remove and discard the adapter plastic housing (D).</p><p class="First">6. Attach the prefilled syringe to the vial adapter thread by turning clockwise (E).</p><p class="First">7. Remove the clear plastic plunger rod from the carton. Grasp the plunger rod by the top plate. <span class="Bold">Avoid touching the sides and threads of the plunger rod.</span> Attach the plunger rod by turning it clockwise into the threaded rubber stopper of the prefilled syringe (F).</p><p class="First">8. Inject the diluent <span class="Bold">slowly</span> by pushing down on the plunger rod (G).</p><p class="First">9. Swirl vial gently until all powder on all sides of the vial is dissolved (H). <span class="Bold">Do not shake vial.</span> Be sure that all powder is completely dissolved. <span class="Bold">Do not use if solution contains visible particles or is cloudy.</span></p><p class="First">10. Push down on the plunger to push all air back into the vial. Then while holding the plunger down, turn the vial with syringe upside-down (invert) so the vial is now above the syringe (I). Pooling: Pooling is a process of combining the contents of multiple vials into a syringe. If the dose requires more than one vial, reconstitute each vial as described above with the diluent syringe provided. To combine the contents of the vials, use a larger plastic syringe (not provided) to pool the solution into the syringe and administer as usual.</p><p class="First">11. Filter the reconstituted product to remove potential particulate matter in the solution. Filtering is achieved by using the vial adapter. Withdraw all the solution through the vial adapter into the syringe by pulling the plunger rod back slowly and smoothly (J). Tilt the vial to the side and back to make sure all the solution has been drawn toward the large opening in the rubber stopper and into the syringe. Remove as much air as possible before removing the syringe from the vial by slowly and carefully pushing the air back into the vial.</p><p class="First">12. Detach the syringe with plunger rod from the vial adapter by turning counter-clockwise. Attach the syringe to the infusion set provided and inject the reconstituted product intravenously (K). NOTE: follow instructions for infusion set provided.</p><p><span class="Bold">Rate of Administration</span></p><p>The entire dose of Jivi can usually be infused within 1 to 15 minutes. The maximum rate is 2.5 mL per minute. Your healthcare provider will determine the rate of administration that is best for you.</p><p><span class="Bold">Resources at Bayer available to the patient:</span></p><p>For Adverse Reaction Reporting, contact Bayer Medical Communications 1-888-84-BAYER (1-888-842-2937)</p><p>To receive more product information, contact Jivi Customer Service 1-888-606-3780</p><p>Bayer Reimbursement HELPline 1-800-288-8374</p><p>For more information, visit http://www.Jivi.com</p><p>Bayer HealthCare LLC<br/>
