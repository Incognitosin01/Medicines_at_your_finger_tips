It is used for short-term treatment (7 to 10 days) of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with a history of erosive esophagitis. GERD is a condition in which the acid in the stomach washes back up into the esophagus. This medicine may also be used to treat Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or other conditions (eg, cancer) in which the stomach produces too much acid.</p><p>Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach.</p><p>This medicine is given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Protonix IV</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
