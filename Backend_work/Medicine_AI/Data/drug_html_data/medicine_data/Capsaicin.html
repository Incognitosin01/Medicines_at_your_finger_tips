In arthritis, capsaicin induces release of substance P, the principal chemomediator of pain impulses from the periphery to the CNS, from peripheral sensory neurons; after repeated application, capsaicin depletes the neuron of substance P and prevents reaccumulation. The functional link between substance P and the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1, is not well understood.</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Topical patch (capsaicin 8%): Systemic absorption is transient and low (&lt;5 ng/mL) in approximately one-third of patients when measured following 60-minute application. In patients with quantifiable concentrations, most fell below the limit of quantitation at 3 to 6 hours post application.</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>OTC products (capsaicin 0.025% to 0.1%): 2 to 4 weeks of continuous therapy; Qutenza patch: 1 week after application</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Topical patch (capsaicin 8%): 1.64 hours (Babbar 2009)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Muscle/Joint pain:</b> Temporary relief of minor aches and pains of muscles and joints associated with simple backache, muscle strains, sprains, arthritis, bruises, or cramps.</p><p><b>Neuropathic pain (8% patch):</b> Management of neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the feet in adults.</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Burning mouth syndrome (topical)</h3><p>Data from a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study in patients with burning mouth syndrome suggests that capsaicin 0.02% oral rinse (unavailable in the US) may be beneficial for the treatment of this condition (Silvestre 2012). In addition, data from a limited number of patients studied (single case report) suggest that topical capsaicin (Tabasco sauce diluted in water), may be beneficial for the treatment of burning mouth syndrome (Spice 2004). Data from a prospective, triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study demonstrated that the use of <i>systemic</i> capsaicin 0.25% capsules (unavailable in the US) is effective for the short-term treatment of burning mouth syndrome but significant gastrointestinal side effects were seen (Petruzzi, 2004). Because of the side effects seen with <i>systemic</i> capsaicin, some authors do not recommend the use of capsaicin for this condition. Instead, other treatments are recommended (eg, topical clonazepam) (Minquez Serra 2007). Additional data may be necessary to further define the role of capsaicin in treatment of burning mouth syndrome. Optimal dosing has yet to be established.</p><h3>Diabetic neuropathy</h3><p>Based on the American Academy of Neurology, the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine, and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation guidelines for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy, capsaicin 0.075% given for diabetic neuropathy is probably effective and recommended in the management of this condition.</p><h3>Pain associated with psoriasis and intractable pruritus</h3><p>Data from two double-blind randomized clinical trials in patients with pruritic psoriasis suggest that capsaicin cream may be beneficial for the treatment of pain associated with psoriasis and intractable pruritus (Bernstein, 1986; Ellis, 1993). Additional trials may be necessary to further define the role of capsaicin in this condition.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to capsaicin, menthol, or any component of the formulation.</p><p>OTC labeling: When used for self-medication, do not use on wounds, damaged, broken, irritated skin, or into skin folds; do not cover with bandage; do not apply within 1 hour before or after bath, shower, hot tub, or sauna; do not use in combination with external heat source (eg, heating pad); do not use concurrently with other topical analgesics.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Diabetic neuropathy: Topical:</b></p><p>Cream (0.075%) (off-label use): Apply 4 times/day (Bril 2011).</p><p>Patch (Qutenza): Apply patch to most painful areas of the feet for 30 minutes.

Gently rub into painful area until thoroughly absorbed. Wash hands with soap and water immediately after applying (unless hands are part of the treatment area). If applying cream to hands, wait 30 minutes before washing hands.</p><p><b>Topical</b> <b>patch</b>:</p><p>≤0.05% products: Apply patch externally to clean and dry affected area. Remove protective film prior to application. May cut patch to desired size prior to removing the film (product specific). Do not use within 1 hour prior to a bath or immediately after bathing. Do not use with a heating pad.</p><p>8% product (Qutenza): Patch should only be applied by a health care provider in a well-ventilated area. The treatment area must be identified and marked by the health care provider. May cut patch (prior to removing the protective release liner) to match size/shape of treatment area. If necessary, excessive hair present on and surrounding the treatment area may be clipped (not shaved). Prior to application, the treatment area should be cleansed with mild soap and water and dried thoroughly. The treatment area and surrounding 1 to 2 cm should be anesthetized with a topical anesthetic prior to patch application; keep the local anesthetic in place until the skin is anesthetized and then remove with a dry wipe; cleanse area again with soap/water and dry thoroughly. Keep patch in sealed pouch until immediately before use; patch may then be applied to dry, intact skin using nitrile gloves (latex gloves should <b>not</b> be used). Use of a face mask and protective glasses are also recommended during application. During administration, avoid unnecessary contact with items in room (eg, items patient may later have contact with, including bedsheets, horizontal surfaces). If applying to feet, examine feet to detect skin lesions prior to patch application. During application, slowly peel back the release liner under the patch and use other hand to smooth patch onto skin. If applying to feet, patch may be wrapped around the dorsal, lateral, and plantar surfaces of each foot to completely cover treatment area. Patch should remain in place for 30 minutes if applying to feet or 60 minutes for all other areas; to ensure patch remains on treatment area, a dressing (eg, rolled gauze) may be used. Remove patches gently and slowly by rolling adhesive side inward. Following patch removal, apply cleansing gel to the treatment area and leave in place for at least 1 minute. Remove cleansing gel with a dry wipe and gently wash the area with mild soap and water and dry thoroughly. Clean all areas that came in contact with patch; all treatment materials (including used and unused cut patches, associated packaging, cleansing gel, gloves, other treatment materials) should be disposed of according to biomedical waste procedures.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at room temperature; protect from light.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>There are no known significant interactions.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.

In some cases, hospitalization has been required. Discontinue use and seek medical attention if signs of skin injury (eg, pain, swelling, or blistering) occur following application (FDA Drug Safety Communication 2012).</p><p>• CNS depression: May cause CNS depression, which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks that require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery, driving).</p><p>• Irritation (8% patch): Severe irritation to the eyes, mucous membranes, respiratory tract, or skin may occur due to unintended capsaicin exposure. If irritation of the eyes or mucous membranes occurs, remove the individual from the area of the capsaicin patch and flush eyes and mucous membranes with cool water. If respiratory tract irritation (eg, coughing, sneezing) occurs, remove the individual from the area of the capsaicin patch and provide supportive care if shortness of breath develops. If skin not intended to be treated is exposed to the patch, apply cleansing gel for 1 minute and remove with dry gauze; after cleansing gel has been removed, wash the area with soap and water; postapplication pain should be treated with local cooling methods (ice pack) and/or analgesics. Clean all areas that had contact with capsaicin.</p><p>• Sensory function reduction (8% patch): Decreased sensory function, including to thermal and other harmful stimuli, has been reported; effects are usually minor and temporary. Patients with preexisting sensory deficits should be assessed for sensory deterioration or loss prior to each patch application. Continued use should be reevaluated for new onset or worsening of existing sensory deficits.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use the 8% patch with caution in patients with uncontrolled hypertension or a history of cardiovascular events; transient increases in BP due to treatment-related pain have occurred during and after application. Monitor BP periodically during and following treatment.</p><p>• Cerebrovascular disease: Use the 8% patch with caution in patients with a history of cerebrovascular events; transient increases in BP due to treatment-related pain have occurred during and after application of RX patch. Monitor BP periodically during and following treatment.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; CDC, 1982); some data suggest that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p>• Patch (8%): Avoid inhaling airborne material from dried residue. Remove patches gently and slowly to decrease risk of aerosolization; inhalation of airborne capsaicin may result in coughing or sneezing.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For external use only; avoid contact with eyes, mouth, genitals, or any or other mucous membranes. Do not use immediately before or after activities such as bathing, swimming, showering, sunbathing, strenuous exercise, steam bath, sauna, or other heat or sunlight exposure to the treated area. Stop use and consult a health care provider if excessive redness, blistering burning or irritation develops, symptoms get worse, symptoms persist for &gt;7 days, symptoms resolve and then recur, or if difficulty breathing or swallowing occurs. Do not handle contact lenses for 1 hour after handling, applying, or removing capsaicin (product specific).</p><p>• OTC labeling: Transient burning may occur and generally disappears after several days.</p><p>• RX labeling: Do not cover with bandage or compression. Use only on intact skin; do not use on wounds, damaged, broken, infected, sensitive, or inflamed skin. Do not apply to face or scalp. Do not use concurrently with other external pain-relieving products.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>8% patch: BP periodically during and following treatment; sensory deficits.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Systemic absorption is limited following topical administration of the patch, and fetal exposure is not expected following maternal use; plasma concentrations are below the limit of detection 3 to 6 hours after the patch is removed.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to ease muscle and joint aches and pain.</p><p>• It is used to help diabetic nerve pain.</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
