It works by stopping or delaying the release of an egg from an ovary. Ulipristal may also make it harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus.</p><p>Ulipristal is used to prevent pregnancy after having sex without using a condom or other effective birth control method. Ulipristal is also used to prevent pregnancy after a regular form of birth control has failed. Ulipristal is not to be used as a regular form of daily, weekly, or monthly birth control.</p><p><b>ULIPRISTAL SHOULD NOT BE USED TO TERMINATE AN EXISTING PREGNANCY.</b></p><p>Ulipristal may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Ulipristal is not to be used as a regular form of daily, weekly, or monthly birth control.</p><p><b>Ulipristal can harm an unborn baby or cause birth defects.

Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully. Ulipristal can be taken any time during your menstrual cycle, but you must use the medicine within 5 days (120 hours) after unprotected sex.</p><p>If you vomit within 3 hours after taking ulipristal, your medication may not be as effective.

Both ulipristal and hormonal birth control may be less effective when used at the same time. You may need to use a barrier form of birth control until your hormonal birth control takes effect.</p><p>Store ulipristal in the original container at room temperature, away from moisture, heat, and light.</p><p>Contact your doctor if your next menstrual period is more than 1 week late.
