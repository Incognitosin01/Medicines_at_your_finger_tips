For best results Vetrimec Pour-On should be part of a parasite control program for both internal and external parasites based on the epidemiology of these parasites. Consult your veterinarian or an entomologist for the most effective timing of applications.</p><h2>Dosage</h2><p class="First">The dose rate is 1 mL for each 22 lb of body weight.The formulation should be applied along the topline in a narrow strip extending from the withers to the tailhead.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Collapsible Pack (33.8 fl oz/1 liter pack with dispensing cap)</span></p><p>The dispensing cap is graduated in 5 mL increments. Each 5 mL will treat 110 lbs body weight. When body weight is between markings, use the next higher increment. Attach the dispensing cap to the bottle. Select the correct dose rate by rotating the adjuster top in either direction to position the dose indicator to the appropriate level. Hold the bottle upright and gently squeeze it to deliver a slight excess of the required dose as indicated by the calibration lines. By releasing the pressure, the dose automatically adjusts to the correct level. Tilt the bottle to deliver the dose. The "closed-off-shut" position will close the system between dosing. If the animal being treated weighs more than 550 lbs (250 kg), refill the dispensing cap to the additional amount required to provide the total dose for that animal and apply as directed.</p><p><span class="Italics">Collapsible Pack (84.5 fl oz/2.5 liter pack; 169 fl oz/5 liter pack with dosing gun/applicator)</span></p><p>Because of the solvents used in Vetrimec Pour-On, the applicator gun from Simcro Tech, or equivalent, is recommended. Other applicators may exhibit compatibility problems resulting in locking, incorrect dosage or leakage. Screw Feedlot pack cap and dip tube onto the 20 liter drum ensuring a tight fit. Connect the long 3m feed tube at one end to the spigot on the Feedlot pack cap and the other end to the applicator gun. Then follow the applicator gun manufacturer's directions for priming the gun, adjusting the dose, and care of the applicator gun following use.</p><p><span class="Italics">Container (676 fl oz/20 liter container with draw-off device and dosing gun/applicator)</span></p><p>Because of the solvents used in Vetrimec Pour-On, the draw-off device and applicator gun from Simcro Tech, or equivalent, is recommended. Other applicators may exhibit compatibility problems resulting in locking, incorrect dosage or leakage. Screw Feedlot pack cap and dip tube onto the 20 liter drum ensuring a tight fit. Connect the long 3m feed tube at one end to the spigot on the Feedlot pack cap and the other end to the applicator gun. Then follow the applicator gun manufacturer's directions for priming the gun, adjusting the dose, and care of the applicator gun following use.</p><p>When the interval between use of the applicator gun is expected to exceed 12 hours, disconnect the gun, draw off tubing and dip tub and cap from the product container, empty the product from the gun and tubing back into the container and replace the shipping cap.</p><h2>Mode of Action</h2><p class="First">Ivermectin is a member of the macrocylic lactone class of endectocides which have a unique mode of action. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells.</p><p>This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).</p><p>The margin of safety for compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels, the macrocylic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.</p><h2>Animal Safety</h2><p class="First">Studies conducted in the U.S.A. have demonstrated the safety margin for ivermectin. Based on plasma levels, the topically applied formulation is expected to be at least as well tolerated by breeding animals as is the subcutaneous formulation which had no effect on breeding performance.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">RESIDUE INFORMATION:</span> Cattle must not be treated within 48 days of slaughter for human consumption. Because a withdrawal time in milk has not been established, do not use in female dairy cattle of breeding age. A withdrawal period has not been established for this product in pre-ruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.</p><h2>WARNING! NOT FOR USE IN HUMANS</h2><p class="First">This product should not be applied to self or others because it may be irritating to human skin and eyes and absorbed through the skin. To minimize accidental skin contact, the user should wear a long-sleeved shirt and rubber gloves. If accidental skin contact occurs, wash immediately with soap and water. If accidental eye exposure occurs, flush eyes immediately with water and seek medical attention.</p><p><span class="Bold">Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">WARNING! FLAMMABLE!</span></p><p><span class="Bold">KEEP AWAY FROM HEAT, SPARKS, OPEN FLAME,</span></p><p><span class="Bold">AND OTHER SOURCES OF IGNITION.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) contains more detailed occupational safety information. To report adverse effects, obtain an MSDS, or for assistance call MWI at (888) 694-8381.</span></p><h2>PRECAUTIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Store away from excessive heat (104° F/40° C) and protect from light.</span></p><p>Use only in well-ventilated areas or outdoors.</p><p>Close container tightly when not in use.</p><p>Cattle should not be treated when hair or hide is wet since reduced efficacy may be experienced.</p><p>Do not use when rain is expected to wet cattle within six hours after treatment.</p><p>This product is for application to skin surface only. Do not give orally or parenterally.</p><p>Cloudiness in the formulation may occur when Vetrimec (ivermectin) Pour-On is stored at temperatures below 32°F. Allowing it to warm at room temperature will restore the normal appearance without affecting efficacy.</p><p>Antiparasitic activity of ivermectin will be impaired if the formulation is applied to areas of the skin with mange scabs or lesions, or with dermatoses or adherent materials, e.g. caked mud or manure.</p><p>Ivermectin has been associated with adverse reactions in sensitive dogs; therefore, Vetrimec Pour-On is not recommended for use in species other than cattle.</p><h3>When to Treat Cattle with Grubs</h3><p class="First">Vetrimec Pour-On effectively controls all stages of cattle grubs. However, proper timing of treatment is important. For the most effective results, cattle should be treated as soon as possible after the end of the heel fly (warble fly) season. While this is not peculiar to ivermectin, destruction of <span class="Italics">Hypoderma</span> larvae (cattle grubs) at the period when these grubs are in vital areas may cause undesirable host-parasite reactions. Killing <span class="Italics">Hypoderma lineatum</span> when it is in the esophageal tissues may cause bloat: killing <span class="Italics">H. bovis</span> when it is in the vertebral canal may cause staggering or paralysis. Cattle should be treated either before or after these stages of grub development.</p><p>Cattle treated with Vetrimec Pour-On at the end of the fly season may be re-treated with Vetrimec during the winter without danger of grub-related reactions. For further information and advice on a planned parasite control program, consult your veterinarian.</p><h2>Environmental Safety</h2><p class="First">Studies indicate that when ivermectin comes in contact with the soil, it readily and tightly binds to the soil and becomes inactive over time. Free ivermectin may adversely affect fish or certain aquatic organisms. Do not permit cattle to enter lakes, streams or ponds for at least six hours after treatment. Do not contaminate water by direct application or by the improper disposal of drug containers. Dispose of containers in an approved landfill or by incineration.</p><p>As with other avermectins, ivermectin is excreted in the dung of treated animals and can inhibit the reproduction and growth of pest and beneficial insects that use dung as a source of food and for reproduction. The magnitude and duration of such effects are species and life-cycle specific. When used according to label directions, the product is not expected to have an adverse impact on populations of dung-dependent insects.</p><h2>Package Information</h2><p class="First">Vetrimec Pour-On is available in a 33.8 fl oz/1 L collapsible pack for use with the dispensing cap provided, or in an 84.5 fl oz/2.5 L collapsible pack, in a 169 fl oz/5 L collapsible pack and a 676 fl oz/20 L container intended for use with appropriate automatic dosing equipment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Restricted Drug - California.
