</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Antidiabetic</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Insulin Lispro, Recombinant</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for insulin lispro-aabc</h2><p>Insulin lispro-aabc, recombinant injection is a fast-acting insulin. Insulin is used by people with diabetes to help keep blood sugar levels under control. When you have diabetes mellitus, your body cannot make enough or does not use insulin properly. So, you must take additional insulin to regulate your blood sugar and keep your body healthy. This is very important as too much sugar in your blood can be harmful to your health.</p><p>Insulin lispro-aabc starts to work faster than some other types of insulin, and its effects do not last as long. It should act more like the insulin your body would normally produce. Because the effects of insulin lispro are short-acting, your doctor may also prescribe a longer-acting insulin for you to use.</p><p>Insulin lispro-aabc is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using insulin lispro-aabc</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For insulin lispro-aabc, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to insulin lispro-aabc or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of insulin lispro-aabc injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of insulin lispro-aabc injection in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking insulin lispro-aabc, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using insulin lispro-aabc with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using insulin lispro-aabc with any of the following is usually not recommended, but may be unavoidable in some cases. If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use insulin lispro-aabc, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><ul>
<li>Ethanol</li>
</ul><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of insulin lispro-aabc. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Heart failure or</li>
<li>Hypokalemia (low potassium in the blood)—Use with caution. May make this condition worse and increase your chance of having serious side effects.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), episode of—Should not be used in patients with this condition. If you have low blood sugar and take insulin, your blood sugar may reach dangerously low levels.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Illness or</li>
<li>Stress (eg, physical or emotional)—Use with caution. These conditions increase blood sugar and may increase the amount of insulin you need.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Kidney disease or</li>
<li>Liver disease—The effects of insulin lispro may be increased because of the slower removal of the medicine from the body.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of insulin lispro-aabc</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional may give you insulin lispro-aabc. You may also be taught how to give your medicine at home. Insulin lispro-aabc is given as a shot under your skin or into a vein.</p><p>Always double-check both the concentration (strength) of your insulin <i>and</i> your dose. <i>Concentration and dose are not the same</i>. The dose is how many units of insulin you will use. The concentration tells how many units of insulin are in each milliliter (mL), such as 100 units/mL (U-100), but this does not mean you will use 100 units at a time.</p><p>Each package of insulin lispro-aabc contains a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read this leaflet carefully and make sure you understand:</p><ul>
<li>How to prepare the medicine.</li>
<li>How to inject the medicine.</li>
<li>How to use a disposable insulin delivery device.</li>
<li>How to dispose of syringes, needles, and injection devices.</li>
</ul><p>It is best to use a different place on the body for each injection (eg, under the skin of your abdomen or stomach, thigh, buttocks, or upper arm). <i>Do not use the exact same spot for each injection</i>. If you have questions about this, contact a member of your health care team.</p><p>Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, bruised, scaly, hard, damaged, thick, or has pits, lumps, or scars.</p><p>When used as a mealtime insulin, it should be taken at the start of a meal or within 20 minutes after you start a meal.</p><p>The insulin solution should look clear and colorless. Do not use it if it is thick, cloudy, discolored, or if there are lumps or particles in it.</p><p><i>To use the KwikPen®, Tempo Pen™, or Junior KwikPen®</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water.</li>
<li>Prime the pen by removing the air from the needle and cartridge. Select 2 units when turning the dose knob.</li>
<li>Hold the pen with the needle pointing up, then gently tap the cartridge holder to collect the air bubbles at the top.</li>
<li>Push the dose knob until it stops. You should see a "0" in the dose window. Hold the dose knob in and slowly count to 5.</li>
<li>You should see insulin at the needle tip. If you do not see insulin, repeat the priming steps but not more than 4 times. If there is still no insulin, change the needle then repeat the priming steps.</li>
<li>If your dose is more than 60 units (30 units for Junior KwikPen®), you will need to give more than 1 injection. Use a new needle for each injection and repeat the priming steps.</li>
<li>When taking your dose, turn the dose knob to select the number of units you need to inject. The pen dials 1 unit (0.5 unit for Junior KwikPen®) at a time and the dose knob clicks as you turn it. Do not dial your dose by counting the clicks as this can lead to you getting too much or too little insulin.</li>
<li>Insert the needle into your skin and push the knob all the way in. Continue to hold it, then slowly count to 5 before removing it.</li>
<li>If you see "0" in the dose window, you have received the full dose. Do not redial if you do not see a "0". Reinsert the needle into your skin and finish the injection.</li>
<li>If you need 2 injections for a full dose, be sure to take the second injection.</li>
<li>Use a new needle each time you give yourself an injection. Always remove and throw the needle after each injection. Store the pen without a needle attached. Do not use the pen if it is broken or damaged.</li>
</ul><p><i>To use the vial</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water.</li>
<li>Use only syringes that are made for insulin injections. Use a new syringe and needle each time you give yourself an injection.</li>
<li>Do not mix insulin lispro-aabc with any other insulin.</li>
</ul><p>Do not transfer <i>Lyumjev™ U-200</i> from the prefilled pen to a syringe for use.</p><p><i>Follow carefully the special meal plan your doctor gave you</i>. This is the most important part of controlling your condition, and is necessary if the medicine is to work properly. Also, exercise regularly and test for sugar in your blood or urine as directed.</p><p>Do not change the brand, type, or dose of your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. When you receive a new supply of insulin, check the label to be sure if it is the correct type of insulin.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of insulin lispro-aabc will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of insulin lispro-aabc. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

Keep this container away from children and pets.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using insulin lispro-aabc</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> especially during the first few weeks you use insulin lispro-aabc. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p><i>Never share insulin pens or cartridges with others under any circumstances</i>. It is not safe for one pen to be used for more than one person. Sharing needles or pens can result in transmission of hepatitis viruses, HIV, or other bloodborne illnesses.</p><p>It is very important to follow carefully any instructions from your health care team about:</p><ul>
<li>Alcohol—Drinking alcohol (including beer and wine) may cause severe low blood sugar. Discuss this with your health care team.</li>
<li>Other medicines—Do not take other medicines during the time you are taking insulin lispro unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes nonprescription medicines such as aspirin, and medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems.</li>
<li>Counseling—Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Also, patients with diabetes may need special counseling about diabetes medicine dosing changes that might occur because of lifestyle changes, such as changes in exercise and diet. Furthermore, counseling on contraception and pregnancy may be needed because of the problems that can occur in patients with diabetes during pregnancy.</li>
<li>Travel—Keep a recent prescription and your medical history with you. Be prepared for an emergency as you would normally. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times.</li>
</ul><p>In case of emergency—There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to:</p><ul>
<li>Wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says that you have diabetes and a list of all of your medicines.</li>
<li>Keep an extra supply of insulin and syringes with needles or injection devices on hand in case high blood sugar occurs.</li>
<li>Keep some kind of quick-acting sugar handy to treat low blood sugar.</li>
<li>Have a glucagon kit and a syringe and needle available in case severe low blood sugar occurs. Check and replace any expired kits regularly.</li>
</ul><p>Insulin lispro-aabc may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, swelling of the face, tongue, and throat, trouble breathing, or chest pain after you get the injection.</p><p>Using insulin lispro-aabc together with other diabetes medicine (eg, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, Actos®, Actoplus Met®, Avandia®) may cause serious heart problems or edema (fluid retention). Check with your doctor immediately if you are rapidly gaining weight, having chest pain or discomfort, extreme tiredness or weakness, trouble breathing, uneven heartbeat, or excessive swelling of the hands, wrist, ankles, or feet.</p><p>Too much insulin lispro can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Low blood sugar can also occur if you use insulin lispro with another antidiabetic medicine, changes in insulin regimen (eg, insulin strength, type of insulin, injection site), delay or miss a meal or snack, exercise more than usual, drink alcohol, or cannot eat because of nausea or vomiting or have diarrhea. <i>Low blood sugar must be treated before it causes you to pass out (unconsciousness). People feel different symptoms of low blood sugar</i>. It is important that you learn which symptoms you usually have so that you can treat it quickly. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat low blood sugar.</p><p>Symptoms of low blood sugar include anxiety, behavior change similar to being drunk, blurred vision, cold sweats, confusion, depression, difficulty in thinking, dizziness or lightheadedness, drowsiness, excessive hunger, fast heartbeat, headache, irritability or abnormal behavior, nervousness, nightmares, restless sleep, shakiness, slurred speech, and tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or tongue.</p><p>If symptoms of low blood sugar occur, eat glucose tablets or gel, corn syrup, honey, or sugar cubes, or drink fruit juice, non-diet soft drink, or sugar dissolved in water to relieve the symptoms. Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Go to a doctor or a hospital right away if the symptoms do not improve. Someone should call for emergency help immediately if severe symptoms, such as convulsions (seizures) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe and needle, and know how to use it. Members of your household should also know how to use it.</p><p>Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur if you do not take enough or skip a dose of your antidiabetic medicine or insulin, changes in insulin regimen, you overeat or do not follow your meal plan, have a fever or infection, or do not exercise as much as usual. High blood sugar can be very serious and must be treated right away. It is important that you learn which symptoms you have in order to treat it quickly. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat high blood sugar.</p><p>Symptoms of high blood sugar include blurred vision, drowsiness, dry mouth, flushed, dry skin, fruit-like breath odor, increased urination, ketones in the urine, loss of appetite, stomachache, nausea or vomiting, tiredness, troubled breathing (rapid and deep), unconsciousness, and unusual thirst. If these symptoms occur, check your blood sugar level and then call your doctor for instructions.</p><p>Insulin lispro-aabc may make you less alert than you are normally. <i>Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how insulin lispro-aabc affects you</i>.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Insulin lispro-aabc side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
