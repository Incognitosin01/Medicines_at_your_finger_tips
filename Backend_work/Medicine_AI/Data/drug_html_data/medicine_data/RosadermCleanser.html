</ul><p>The Rosaderm Cleanser brand name has been discontinued in the U.S. If generic versions of this product have been approved by the FDA, there may be generic equivalents available.</p><h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods-Fildes theory which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth. While absorption through intact skin has not been determined, sodium sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine, largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours. The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown, but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of Propionibacterium acnes and the formation of free fatty acids.</p><h2>INDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Rosaderm™ Cleanser is indicated in the topical control of acne vulgaris, acne rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Rosaderm™ Cleanser is contraindicated for use by patients having known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, sulfur or any other component of this preparation. Rosaderm™ Cleanser  is not to be used by patients with kidney disease.</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First">Although it is rare, sensitivity to sodium sulfacetamide may occur. Therefore, caution and careful supervision should be observed when prescribing this drug for patients who may be prone to hypersensitivity to topical sulfonamides. Systemic toxic reactions such as agranulocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, purpura hemorrhagica, drug fever jaundice, and contact dermatitis indicate hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Particular caution should be employed if areas of denuded or abraded skin are involved.<br/>
