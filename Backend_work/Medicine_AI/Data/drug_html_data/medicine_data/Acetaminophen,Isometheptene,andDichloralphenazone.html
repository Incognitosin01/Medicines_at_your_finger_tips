Similarly, Alpha-/Beta-Agonists may antagonize Alpha1-Blocker vasodilation.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>AtoMOXetine: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. AtoMOXetine may enhance the tachycardic effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Barbiturates: May increase the metabolism of Acetaminophen. This may 1) diminish the effect of acetaminophen; and 2) increase the risk of liver damage.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Busulfan: Acetaminophen may increase the serum concentration of Busulfan. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Cannabinoid-Containing Products: May enhance the tachycardic effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>CarBAMazepine: May increase the metabolism of Acetaminophen. This may 1) diminish the effect of acetaminophen; and 2) increase the risk of liver damage.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Chloroprocaine: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Cocaine (Topical): May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Management: Consider alternatives to use of this combination when possible. Monitor closely for substantially increased blood pressure or heart rate and for any evidence of myocardial ischemia with concurrent use.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Dapsone (Topical): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Dasatinib: Acetaminophen may enhance the hepatotoxic effect of Dasatinib. Dasatinib may increase the serum concentration of Acetaminophen.  Management: Avoid coadministration of acetaminophen and dasatinib if possible. If coadministration is unavoidable, monitor for signs/symptoms of hepatotoxicity, particularly in patients with greater acetaminophen exposure.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Doxofylline: Sympathomimetics may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Doxofylline. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Ergot Derivatives: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists. Ergot Derivatives may enhance the vasoconstricting effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Flucloxacillin: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Acetaminophen. Specifically, the risk for high anion gap metabolic acidosis may be increased.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Fosphenytoin-Phenytoin: May decrease the serum concentration of Acetaminophen. Specifically, serum concentrations of acetaminophen may be decreased (leading to decreased efficacy), but the formation of the toxic N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) metabolite may be increased (leading to increased hepatotoxicity).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Guanethidine: May enhance the arrhythmogenic effect of Sympathomimetics. Guanethidine may enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Imatinib: Acetaminophen may enhance the hepatotoxic effect of Imatinib. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Isoniazid: May enhance the hepatotoxic effect of Acetaminophen. Isoniazid may increase the metabolism of Acetaminophen. Specifically, formation of the hepatotoxic NAPQI metabolite may be increased.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>LamoTRIgine: Acetaminophen may decrease the serum concentration of LamoTRIgine. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Local Anesthetics: Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Local Anesthetics. Specifically, the risk for methemoglobinemia may be increased. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Lorlatinib: May decrease the serum concentration of Acetaminophen.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>MetyraPONE: May increase the serum concentration of Acetaminophen. More importantly, by inhibiting the conjugative metabolism of acetaminophen, metyrapone may shift the metabolism towards the oxidative route that produces a hepatotoxic metabolite.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Mipomersen: Acetaminophen may enhance the hepatotoxic effect of Mipomersen. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Isometheptene.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Nitric Oxide: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents. Combinations of these agents may increase the likelihood of significant methemoglobinemia.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Ozanimod: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Management: Concomitant use of ozanimod with sympathomimetic agents is not recommended. If combined, monitor patients closely for the development of hypertension, including hypertensive crises.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Phenylephrine (Systemic): Acetaminophen may increase the serum concentration of Phenylephrine (Systemic). <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Prilocaine: Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Prilocaine. Combinations of these agents may increase the likelihood of significant methemoglobinemia.  Management: Monitor patients for signs of methemoglobinemia (e.g., hypoxia, cyanosis) when prilocaine is used in combination with other agents associated with development of methemoglobinemia.  Avoid lidocaine/prilocaine in infants receiving such agents.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Probenecid: May increase the serum concentration of Acetaminophen. Probenecid may also limit the formation of at least one major non-toxic metabolite, possibly increasing the potential for formation of the toxic NAPQI metabolite. Management: Consider limiting acetaminophen use in combination with probenecid. Probenecid may reduce clearance of acetaminophen to one of its non-toxic metabolities, increasing the risk for acetaminophen toxicity, even a lower doses.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Serotonin/Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors: May enhance the tachycardic effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists. Serotonin/Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors may enhance the vasopressor effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists. Management: If possible, avoid coadministration of direct-acting alpha-/beta-agonists and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. If coadministered, monitor for increased sympathomimetic effects (eg, increased blood pressure, chest pain, headache).<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Sodium Nitrite: Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Sodium Nitrite. Combinations of these agents may increase the likelihood of significant methemoglobinemia. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Solriamfetol: Sympathomimetics may enhance the hypertensive effect of Solriamfetol. Sympathomimetics may enhance the tachycardic effect of Solriamfetol. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>SORAfenib: Acetaminophen may enhance the hepatotoxic effect of SORAfenib. SORAfenib may increase the serum concentration of Acetaminophen.  Management: Avoid coadministration of acetaminophen and sorafenib if possible. If coadministration is unavoidable, monitor for signs/symptoms of hepatotoxicity, particularly in patients with greater acetaminophen exposure.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Spironolactone: May diminish the vasoconstricting effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Sympathomimetics: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of other Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Tedizolid: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Tedizolid may enhance the tachycardic effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Tricyclic Antidepressants: May enhance the vasopressor effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists. Management: Avoid, if possible, the use of alpha-/beta-agonists in patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants. If combined, monitor for evidence of increased pressor effects and consider reductions in initial dosages of the alpha-/beta-agonist.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Vitamin K Antagonists (eg, warfarin): Acetaminophen may enhance the anticoagulant effect of Vitamin K Antagonists. This appears most likely with daily acetaminophen doses exceeding 1.3 or 2 g/day for multiple consecutive days. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Test Interactions</h2><p>Acetaminophen may cause false urine glucose, urine catecholamine, and urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid test results.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.
