The ingredients in TheraTears Nutrition include fish oil and organic flaxseed oil for their omega 3 content, and vitamin E which acts as an antioxidant.</p><p>Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are lipids that cannot be made by our body and have to be obtained from our diet and include fats such as omega 3. EFAs are used by the oil glands in our eyelids to make the oily layer of tear film. TheraTears Nutrition provides omega 3 EFAs that may be used by our oil glands to make good quality tears.</p><p>Tear film is made up of three layers – an oil layer, a water layer and a mucin layer (helps the tears to stick to the surface of the eye and provides the underlying cornea with nourishment). Tears are vital for the health of our eye and our vision, without sufficient good quality tears, our eyes are at increased risk for infection and damage from foreign particles. Dry eye is a condition that results from poor quality tears. TheraTears Nutrition is recommended for eye conditions such as dry eye.</p><p>TheraTears Nutrition also supports oral health, because the salivary gland and tear glands work in a similar way. The omega 3’s in TheraTears Nutrition help with the production of healthy saliva and help with the maintenance of good oral health.</p><h2>Important Information</h2><p>Take TheraTears Nutrition exactly as directed on the label, or as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take it in larger amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>TheraTears Nutrition should not be used in patients with a fish or soy allergy (soybean oil is used as a carrier for Vitamin E, another ingredient in TheraTears Nutrition).

</p><p>People with coagulopathy or taking anticoagulants or other medications should notify their physician prior to taking dietary supplements, including TheraTears Nutrition.</p>
<p>Stop taking TheraTears Nutrition at least two weeks prior to any scheduled surgery or procedure.</p>
<p>Swallow the TheraTears Nutrition capsule whole. Do not puncture or open the capsule.</p>
<p>Marine Oils like TheraTears Nutrition help support eye function but are only part of a complete program of eye care that may include proper eye cleansing and lubricating eye drops.</p>
<p>There may be other drugs that can interact with TheraTears Nutrition. Tell your doctor about all medications you use. This includes prescription, over-the-counter, vitamin, and herbal products. Do not start a new medication without telling your doctor.</p>
<p>Stop using TheraTears Nutrition and get emergency medical help if you think you have used too much medicine, or if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p>
<p>Less serious side effects are more likely, and you may have none at all. Talk to your doctor about any side effect that seems unusual or is especially bothersome.</p>
<p> The omega 3’s in TheraTears Nutrition are derived from highly refined fish oil obtained from anchovies and organic flaxseed oil. These sources are likely to have lower levels of contaminants and toxins than other sources of fish oil such as marlin, tuna, or swordfish.</p>
