</ul><p class="First">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs, including Kurvelo, are contraindicated in women who are over 35 years of age and smoke [see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS (1)].</p><h2>Kurvelo Description</h2><h2>Kurvelo - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Combination oral contraceptives prevent pregnancy primarily by suppressing ovulation.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Kurvelo</h2><p class="First">Kurvelo is indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Kurvelo is contraindicated in females who are known to have the following conditions:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">1.Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Conditions</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>  Stop Kurvelo if an arterial or venous thrombotic/thromboembolic event occurs.</li>
<li>  Stop Kurvelo if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions and evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately.</li>
<li>  Discontinue Kurvelo during prolonged immobilization. If feasible, stop Kurvelo at least four weeks before and through two weeks after major surgery, or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism.</li>
<li>  Start Kurvelo no earlier than four weeks after delivery in females who are not breast-feeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the likelihood of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.</li>
<li>  Before starting Kurvelo evaluate any past medical history or family history of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders and consider whether the history suggests an inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathy. Kurvelo is contraindicated in females with a high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic/thromboembolic diseases (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Arterial Events</span></p><p>COCs increase the risk of cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. The risk is greater among older women (&gt; 35 years of age), smokers, and females with hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, or obesity.</p><p>Kurvelo is contraindicated in women over 35 years of age who smoke (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked.</p><p><span class="Bold">Venous Events</span></p><p>Use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Risk factors for VTEs include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). While the increased risk of VTE associated with use of COCs is well-established, the rates of VTE are even greater during pregnancy, and especially during the postpartum period (see Figure 1). The rate of VTE in females using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years.</p><p>The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of four weeks or longer. Based on results from a few studies, there is some evidence that this is true for non-oral products as well. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.</p><p>Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for females who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for females who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant females, and for females in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 females who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these females will develop a VTE.</p><p>Figure 1:           Likelihood of Developing a VTE</p><p><span class="Bold">2.Liver Disease</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Elevated Liver Enzymes</span></p><p>Kurvelo is contraindicated in females with acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Discontinue Kurvelo if jaundice develops. Acute liver test abnormalities may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until the liver tests return to normal and COC causation has been excluded.</p><p><span class="Bold">Liver Tumors</span></p><p>Kurvelo is contraindicated in females with benign or malignant liver tumors (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). COCs increase the risk of hepatic adenomas. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death from abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt; 8 years) COC users. The attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.</p><p><span class="Bold">3.Hypertension</span></p><p>Kurvelo is contraindicated in females with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). For all females, including those with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure at routine visits and stop Kurvelo if blood pressure rises significantly.</p><p>An increase in blood pressure has been reported in females using COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The effect of COCs on blood pressure may vary according to the progestin in the COC.</p><p><span class="Bold">4.Age-related</span> <span class="Bold">Considerations</span></p><p>The risk for cardiovascular disease and prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease increase with age. Certain conditions, such as smoking and migraine headache without aura, that do not contraindicate COC use in younger females, are contraindications to use in women over 35 years of age [see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS (1)]. Consider the presence of underlying risk factors that may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or VTE, particularly before initiating a COC for women over 35 years, such as:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>  Hypertension</li>
<li>  Diabetes</li>
<li>  Dyslipidemia</li>
<li>  Obesity</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">5.Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment</span></p><p>During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as COCs. Discontinue Kurvelo prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</p><p>Kurvelo can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the combination drug regimen.</p><p><span class="Bold">6.Gallbladder Disease</span></p><p>Studies suggest an increased risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease.</p><p>A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Females with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC- related cholestasis.</p><p><span class="Bold">7.Adverse Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Hyperglycemia</span></p><p>Kurvelo is contraindicated in diabetic women over age 35, or females who have diabetes with hypertension, nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, other vascular disease, or females with diabetes of &gt; 20 years duration (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Kurvelo may decrease glucose tolerance. Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic females who are using Kurvelo.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dyslipidemia</span></p><p>Consider alternative contraception for females with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. Kurvelo may cause adverse lipid changes.</p><p>Females with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may have an increase in serum triglyceride concentrations when using Kurvelo, which may increase the risk of pancreatitis.</p><p><span class="Bold">8.Headache</span></p><p>Kurvelo is contraindicated in females who have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or have migraine headaches with aura, and in women over age 35 years who have migraine headaches with or without aura (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</p><p>If a woman using Kurvelo develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Kurvelo if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Kurvelo if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraines during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).</p><p><span class="Bold">9.Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting</span></p><p>Females using Kurvelo may experience unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting, especially during the first three months of use. Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy.</p><p>In two clinical trials of Kurvelo (1084 subjects reporting for a total of 8186 treatment cycles and 238 subjects reporting for a total of 1102 treatment cycles), breakthrough bleeding occurred in 6.9% and 8.1% of reported cycles, and spotting occurred in 8.6% and 7.9% of reported cycles over the total study duration, respectively. In the two trials, intermenstrual bleeding (i.e.,breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting) occurred in 13.1% and 12.9% of reported cycles over the total study duration, respectively. In one trial, 33 subjects out of 1084 (3.0%) discontinued due to bleeding irregularities (i.e., breakthrough bleeding and spotting); in the other trial, 6 subjects out of 238 (2.5%) discontinued due to bleeding irregularities.</p><p><span class="Bold">Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea</span></p><p>Females who use Kurvelo may experience absence of scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. In two clinical trials of Kurvelo, one including 8186 reported treatment cycles, and the other including 1102 reported treatment cycles, amenorrhea occurred in 1.5% of treatment cycles in each trial.</p><p>If scheduled bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or two active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and perform appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.</p><p>After discontinuation of a COC, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur, especially if these conditions were pre-existent.</p><p><span class="Bold">10.Depression</span></p><p>Carefully observe females with a history of depression and discontinue Kurvelo if depression recurs to a serious degree. Data on the association of COCs with onset of depression or exacerbation of existing depression are limited.</p><p><span class="Bold">11.Cervical Cancer</span></p><p>Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. There is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</p><p><span class="Bold">12.Effect on Binding Globulins</span></p><p>The estrogen component of Kurvelo may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine- binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.</p><p><span class="Bold">13.Hereditary Angioedema</span></p><p>In females with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.</p><p><span class="Bold">14.Chloasma</span></p><p>Chloasma may occur with Kurvelo use, especially in females with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Advise females with a history of chloasma to avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while using Kurvelo.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">1.Lipid Disorders</span></p><p>Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult [see WARNINGS (7)].</p><p>In patients with familial defects of lipoprotein metabolism receiving estrogen-containing preparations, there have been case reports of significant elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis.</p><p><span class="Bold">2.Fluid Retention</span></p><p>Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.</p><p><span class="Bold">3.Gastrointestinal Motility</span></p><p>Diarrhea and/or vomiting may reduce hormone absorption (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p><p><span class="Bold">4.Drug Interactions</span></p><p>The sections below provide information on substances for which data on drug interactions with COCs are available. There is little information available about the clinical effect of most drug interactions that may affect COCs. However, based on the known pharmacokinetic effects of these drugs, clinical strategies to minimize any potential adverse effect on contraceptive effectiveness or safety are suggested.</p><p>Consult the approved product labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for metabolic enzyme or transporter system alterations<span class="Bold">.</span></p><p>No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Kurvelo.</p><p><span class="Bold">4.1Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs and Potentially Diminishing the</span> <span class="Bold">Efficacy of COCs:</span></p><p>Table 1 includes substances that demonstrated an important drug interaction with Kurvelo.</p><p><span class="Bold">Substances increasing the systemic exposure of COCs:</span></p><p>Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase systemic exposure of ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20 to 25 percent. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase systemic exposure of ethinyl estradiol, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase systemic exposure of the estrogen and/or progestin component of COCs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors:</span></p><p>Significant decreases in systemic exposure of the estrogen and/or progestin have been noted when COCs are co-administered with some HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir), some HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir), and some non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., nevirapine).</p><p>In contrast, significant increases in systemic exposure of the estrogen and/or progestin have been noted when COCs are co-administered with certain other HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir) and with other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., etravirine).</p><p><span class="Bold">4.2Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs</span></p><p>Table 2 provides significant drug interaction information for drugs co-administered with Kurvelo.</p><p><span class="Bold">4.3Effect on Laboratory Tests</span></p><p>The use of COCs may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.</p><p><span class="Bold">5.Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>See WARNINGS (11)<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">6.Pregnancy</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Kurvelo is contraindicated in pregnancy because there is no reason to use COCs in pregnancy. Discontinue Kurvelo if pregnancy occurs. Epidemiologic studies and meta- analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or nongenital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to COCs before conception or during early pregnancy. Animal studies to evaluate embryo/fetal toxicity were not conducted.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 percent and 15 to 20 percent, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">7.Lactation</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Contraceptive hormones and/or metabolites are present in human milk. COCs can reduce milk production in breast-feeding females. This reduction can occur at any time but is less likely to occur once breast-feeding is well-established. When possible, advise the nursing female to use other methods of contraception until she discontinues breast-feeding. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)<span class="Italics">.</span> The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Kurvelo and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Kurvelo or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">8.Pediatric Use</span></p><p>Safety and efficacy of Kurvelo have been established in females of reproductive potential. Use of Kurvelo before menarche is not indicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">9.Geriatric Use</span></p><p>Kurvelo has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population.</p><p><span class="Bold">10.PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>  Counsel patients that cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use, and that women who are over 35 years old and smoke should not use COCs.</li>
<li>  Counsel patients that this product does not protect against HIV-infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections.</li>
<li>  Counsel patients to take one tablet daily by mouth at the same time every day. Instruct patients what to do in the event pills are missed.</li>
<li>  Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs.</li>
