It is used to treat a type of cancer of the white blood cells called B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Fludarabine is used in patients with CLL who have already been treated with an alkylating agent (eg, bendamustine) that did not work well.</p><p>Fludarabine interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by the medicine, other effects may also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may occur after treatment with fludarabine has been stopped.</p><p>Before you begin treatment with fludarabine, you and your doctor should talk about the good fludarabine will do as well as the risks of using it.</p><p>Fludarabine was available only with your doctor's prescription. Oral fludarabine was withdrawn from the US market in September 2011.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using fludarabine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For fludarabine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to fludarabine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of fludarabine in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fludarabine in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking fludarabine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using fludarabine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Fludarabine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection (e.g., pneumonia). It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of an infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor right away if you think you are getting an infection or if you have fever or chills; cough or hoarseness; lower back or side pain; painful or difficult urination; shortness of breath; or unusual bleeding or bruising.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; blood in the urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>You should not use fludarabine if you are also taking pentostatin (Nipent®). Taking it together with fludarabine may increase the chance of serious side effects.</p><p>Fludarabine may cause a serious type of reaction called tumor lysis syndrome. Your doctor may give you a medicine to help prevent this. Call your doctor right away if you have a decrease or change in urine amount; joint pain, stiffness, or swelling; lower back, side, or stomach pain; a rapid weight gain; swelling of the feet or lower legs; or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Using fludarabine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant. You should not become pregnant while you are taking fludarabine and for 6 months after stopping it. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Fludarabine side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
