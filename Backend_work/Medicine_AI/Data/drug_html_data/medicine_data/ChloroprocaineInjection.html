This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For chloroprocaine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to chloroprocaine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Because of chloroprocaine's toxicity, it should be used with extreme caution in children younger than 6 months of age. Recommended doses should not be exceeded, and the patient should be carefully monitored during treatment.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of chloroprocaine injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving chloroprocaine injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving chloroprocaine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using chloroprocaine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

<li>Bupivacaine Liposome</li>
<li>Hyaluronidase</li>
<li>St John's Wort</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of chloroprocaine.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of chloroprocaine</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you chloroprocaine in a medical facility. You may receive the injection into your rib cage, chest, or other body areas. Only <i>Nesacaine®-MPF</i> is given through a catheter placed into your lower back for an epidural or a spinal block.</p><p>Chloroprocaine should cause numbness only to the area where it is injected. You may experience temporary loss of sensation or movement in the injected area. This type of numbing procedure is called local anesthesia. It is not meant to cause you to fall asleep or become unconscious.</p><p>You may experience temporary loss of sensation and movement, usually in the lower half of your body, if you receive <i>Nesacaine®-MPF</i> into your lower back (epidural). It may be easier to hurt yourself while your treated body area is still numb. Be careful to avoid injury until you have regained all the feeling and are no longer numb.</p><p>If you are receiving <i>Nesacaine®-MPF</i> as an epidural <i>to ease labor pains</i>, it may take longer than normal for you to push your baby out. It is also possible that the baby may have unwanted effects after birth (including sleepiness, slow responses). Talk to your doctor if you have questions about how chloroprocaine might affect your baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using chloroprocaine</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress closely while receiving chloroprocaine</i> to see if it is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for any unwanted effects.</p><p>Chloroprocaine may cause a rare, but serious blood problem called methemoglobinemia. The risk may be increased in children younger than 6 months of age, elderly patients, or patients with certain inborn defects. It is more likely to occur in patients receiving too much of the medicine, but can also occur with small amounts. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child has the following symptoms after receiving chloroprocaine: pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nails, confusion, headache, lightheadedness, fast heartbeat, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you have the following symptoms with chloroprocaine: anxiety, blurred vision, depression, drowsiness, lightheadedness, nausea or vomiting, numbness and tingling of the mouth or lips, restlessness, ringing in the ears, speech problems, or tremors.</p><p>Chloroprocaine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or throat after receiving chloroprocaine.</p><p>Chloroprocaine may also increase your risk of having serious heart and blood vessel problems such as a heart attack, heart rhythm changes, or low blood pressure. Check with your doctor if you have chest pain or discomfort, pain or discomfort in the arms, jaw, back, or neck, dizziness, fainting, pounding, slow heartbeat, troubled breathing, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor.
