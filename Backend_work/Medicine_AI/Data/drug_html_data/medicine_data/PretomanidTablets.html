Except for one patient who died due to pneumonia and sepsis, all patients who experienced increased transaminases were able to continue therapy and complete the full course of treatment.</p><p>Myelosuppression is a known adverse reaction of linezolid. The most common hematopoietic cytopenia was anemia (37%). The majority of cytopenias began after 2 weeks of treatment. Three patients experienced cytopenias that were considered serious: neutropenia in 1 patient and anemia in 2 patients. All 3 serious adverse reactions resulted in interruption of linezolid or all components of the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid, and all resolved.</p><p class="First">Peripheral neuropathy is a known adverse reaction of linezolid. In Study 1, peripheral neuropathy was reported in 81% of patients. Most of these adverse reactions (64%) occurred after 8 weeks of treatment and resulted in dosing interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of linezolid. Severe, moderate, and mild peripheral neuropathy occurred in 22%, 32%, and 26% of patients, respectively. No adverse reaction related to peripheral neuropathy led to a discontinuation of the entire study regimen.</p><p>Optic neuropathy is a known adverse reaction of linezolid. Two patients (2%) in Study 1 developed optic neuropathy after 16 weeks of treatment. Both were serious, confirmed on retinal examination as optic neuropathy/neuritis, and resulted in discontinuation of linezolid; both adverse reactions resolved.</p><p>Overall, patients administered a linezolid dose of 600 mg twice daily had a similar safety profile to those administered a dose of 1,200 mg once daily.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Effect of Other Drugs on Pretomanid</h3><p class="First">Co-administration of pretomanid with rifampin and efavirenz resulted in a decrease in pretomanid plasma concentrations <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>. Avoid co-administration of the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid with rifampin, efavirenz, or other strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. Refer to the prescribing information for bedaquiline for additional information about drug interactions with CYP3A4.</p><p class="First">Co-administration of pretomanid with lopinavir/ritonavir did not affect the plasma concentrations of pretomanid <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>. Lopinavir/ritonavir can be co-administered with the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid.</p><h3>Effect of Pretomanid on Other Drugs</h3><p class="First">Co-administration of pretomanid with the CYP3A4 substrate, midazolam, resulted in no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam or its major metabolite, 1-hydroxy-midazolam <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. The combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid can be administered with CYP3A4 substrate drugs.</p><p class="First">The effect of co-administration of pretomanid on the pharmacokinetics of OAT3 substrates in humans is unknown. However, in vitro studies indicate that pretomanid significantly inhibits the OAT3 drug transporter <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)],</span> which could result in increased concentrations of OAT3 substrate drugs clinically and may increase the risk of adverse reactions with these drugs.</p><p>If pretomanid is co-administered with OAT3 substrate drugs (e.g., methotrexate), monitor for OAT3 substrate drug-related adverse reactions and consider dosage reduction for OAT3 substrate drugs, if needed. Refer to the prescribing information of the co-administered drug for dosage reduction information.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There are no studies or available data on pretomanid use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. There are risks associated with active tuberculosis during pregnancy <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations).</span> When Pretomanid Tablets are administered in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid, the pregnancy information for bedaquiline and linezolid also applies to this combination regimen. Refer to the bedaquiline and linezolid prescribing information for more information on bedaquiline and linezolid associated risks of use during pregnancy.<span class="Italics"> </span>In animal reproduction studies, there was increased post-implantation loss in the presence of maternal toxicity (reduced bodyweight and feed consumption) with oral administration of pretomanid during organogenesis in rats at doses about 4 times the exposure at the recommended dose in humans. There were no adverse embryo fetal effects in rats or rabbits dosed with oral pretomanid during organogenesis at doses up to approximately 2 times the exposure in humans.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the United States general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First">Active tuberculosis in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes including maternal anemia, caesarean delivery, preterm birth, low birth weight, birth asphyxia, and perinatal infant death.</p><p class="First">In animal reproduction studies, pregnant rats were dosed orally with pretomanid at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day during organogenesis (gestational Days 7 through 17). Rats showed increased post-implantation loss in the presence of maternal toxicity (including reduced body weight and feed consumption) at 100 mg/kg/day, approximately 4 times the exposure in humans for a 200 mg dose on an AUC basis. There were no adverse embryofetal effects in rats dosed with oral pretomanid during organogenesis at doses up to approximately 2 times the exposure in humans. Pregnant rabbits were dosed orally with pretomanid during organogenesis (gestational Days 7 through 19) at 10, 30, and 60 mg/kg/day. No evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed when oral doses of pretomanid were administered to dams during organogenesis (gestational Days 7 to 19) at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the exposure in humans for a 200 mg dose on an AUC basis).</p><p>In a pre- and postnatal development study, there were no adverse developmental effects in pups of pregnant rats orally dosed with up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestational Day 6 through lactation Day 20. Pups of pregnant females dosed at 60 mg/kg/day (about 2 times the exposure for the 200 mg dose) had lower body weights and a slight delay in the age at which the air-drop righting reflex developed. These effects occurred at a maternally toxic dose (based on maternal weight loss and reduced food consumption).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">There is no information regarding the presence of pretomanid in human milk, or its effects on milk production or the breastfed infant. Pretomanid was detected in rat milk <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Pretomanid Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Pretomanid Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. When Pretomanid Tablets are administered in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid, information on lactation for bedaquiline and linezolid also applies to this combination regimen. Refer to the bedaquiline and linezolid prescribing information for more information on their use during lactation.</p><p class="First">In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats treated with pretomanid at doses 0.5 and 2 times the human exposure for a 200 mg dose (AUC) from gestational day 7 through lactation day 20, concentrations in milk on lactation day 14 were 1.4 and 1.6 times higher than the maximum concentration observed in maternal plasma, respectively. The concentration of pretomanid in rat milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of pretomanid in human milk.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Reduced fertility and/or testicular toxicity were observed in male rats and mice treated with oral pretomanid. These effects were associated with hormonal changes including decreased serum inhibin B and increased serum follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone in rodents <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p>Reduced fertility and testicular toxicity cannot be definitively ruled out in male human subjects at this time.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Pretomanid Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The effect of hepatic impairment on the safety, effectiveness, and pharmacokinetics of pretomanid is not known.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The effect of renal impairment on the safety, effectiveness, and pharmacokinetics of pretomanid is not known.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no experience with the treatment of acute overdose with pretomanid. Take general measures to support basic vital functions including monitoring of vital signs and ECG (QT interval) in case of deliberate or accidental overdose.</p><h2>Pretomanid Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Pretomanid is an oral nitroimidazooxazine antimycobacterial drug.</p><p>Pretomanid is a white to off-white to yellow-colored powder. The chemical name for pretomanid is (6<span class="Italics">S</span>)-2-Nitro-6-{[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]methoxy}-6,7-dihydro-5<span class="Italics">H</span>-imidazo[2,1-<span class="Italics">b</span>][1,3]oxazine.

The structural formula of pretomanid is as follows:</p><p>Each Pretomanid Tablet contains 200 mg of pretomanid. The inactive ingredients are colloidal silicon dioxide, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium lauryl sulfate, and sodium starch glycolate.</p><h2>Pretomanid Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Pretomanid is a nitroimidazooxazine antimycobacterial drug <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Microbiology (12.4)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">A randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg), crossover, thorough QT study of pretomanid was performed in 74 healthy adult subjects. At 400 mg (2 times the approved recommended dosage) and 1,000 mg (5 times the approved recommended dosage) single doses of pretomanid, no significant QT prolongation effect was detected.</p><p>In Study 1, patients received the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid for 6 months.

Pretomanid kills actively replicating <span class="Italics">M. tuberculosis</span> by inhibiting mycolic acid biosynthesis, thereby blocking cell wall production. Under anaerobic conditions, against non-replicating bacteria, pretomanid acts as a respiratory poison following nitric oxide release. All of these activities require nitro-reduction of pretomanid within the mycobacterial cell by the deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase, Ddn, which is dependent on the reduced form of the cofactor F<span class="Sub">420</span>. Reduction of F<span class="Sub">420</span> is accomplished by the F<span class="Sub">420</span>-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, Fgd1.</p><p class="First">Mutations in five <span class="Italics">M. tuberculosis</span> genes (<span class="Italics">ddn</span>, <span class="Italics">fgd1</span>, <span class="Italics">fbiA</span>, <span class="Italics">fbiB</span>, and <span class="Italics">fbiC</span>) have been associated with pretomanid resistance. The products of these genes are involved in bioreductive activation of pretomanid within the bacterial cell. Not all isolates with increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) have mutations in these genes, suggesting the existence of at least one other mechanism of resistance. The in vitro frequency of resistance development to pretomanid ranged from 10<span class="Sup">-7</span> to 10<span class="Sup">-5</span> at 2 to 6 times the pretomanid MICs. Cross-resistance of pretomanid with other compounds in the same class has been observed.</p><p class="First">Pretomanid has demonstrated in vitro activity against the <span class="Italics">M. tuberculosis</span> complex. Pretomanid has also demonstrated anti-<span class="Italics">M. tuberculosis</span> activity in animal models of tuberculosis <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Indications and Usage (1)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p>In murine tuberculosis models, the 3-drug combination of pretomanid, bedaquiline, and linezolid reduced bacterial counts in the lungs to a greater extent and resulted in fewer relapses at 2 and 3 months post-therapy compared to 2-drug combinations of pretomanid, bedaquiline, and linezolid.</p><p>In clinical Study 1, the pretomanid MIC was determined using the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT). The baseline pretomanid MIC for <span class="Italics">M. tuberculosis</span> isolates in the study ranged from 0.06 to 1 mcg/mL.</p><p class="First">For specific information regarding susceptibility test criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: www.fda.gov/STIC.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity studies of pretomanid have not been completed.</p><p class="First">No mutagenic or clastogenic effects were detected in both an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay and an in vitro mammalian chromosome aberrations assay using a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Pretomanid was negative for clastogenicity in a mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.</p><p>A metabolite of pretomanid was mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay. This metabolite represents approximately 6% of the human exposure (AUC) to pretomanid at the MRHD.</p><p class="First">In a fertility and general reproduction study in rats, male rats treated orally with pretomanid for 13 to 14 weeks had reduced fertility at 30 mg/kg/day and complete infertility at 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 and 2‑times the human exposure for a 200 mg dose, respectively). At 100 mg/kg/day, males had testicular atrophy including hypospermia in the epididymal tubules and focal epithelial hyperplasia of the epididymal tubular epithelium. Following a 10-week treatment-free period, these effects were partially reversed in male rats given pretomanid at 30 mg/kg/day but not at 100 mg/kg/day. These effects were associated with increased serum follicle-stimulating hormone and decreased serum inhibin B concentrations. There were no effects of pretomanid in male rats treated for 13 weeks at 10 mg/kg/day (approximately half of the human exposure for a 200 mg dose). Pretomanid did not affect mating behavior in female rats given oral pretomanid at 100 mg/kg/day for two weeks (approximately twice the human exposure).</p><p>Testicular toxicity was present in male mice treated orally for 13 weeks at 20 mg/kg/day [approximately equal to the human exposure (AUC) for a 200 mg dose]. There were no adverse testicular effects observed in mice given pretomanid at 6 mg/kg/day (0.2‑times the human exposure for a 200 mg dose).</p><p>Testicular toxicity was observed in male rats following 7 or 14 days of dosing with oral pretomanid at 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 2-times the human exposure for a 200 mg dose). The effects were partially reversible during a 6-month post treatment recovery period in rats treated with pretomanid for 7 days, but not 14 days.</p><p>In a 3-month study, decreased sperm motility and total sperm count, and increased abnormal sperm ratio were noted in sexually mature monkeys given ≥150 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the human exposure for a 200 mg dose).</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Cataracts were observed in rats treated with pretomanid at doses of 300 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks or 100 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks. There were no cataracts observed in rats given oral pretomanid at 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the human exposure for a 200 mg dose) for 26 weeks.</p><p>In monkeys given oral pretomanid at 450 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks and 300 mg/kg/day for 12 more weeks, cataracts were not present at the end of dosing but developed during the 13‑week post treatment recovery period. In a subsequent study, cataracts were not observed following 13 weeks treatment with up to 300 mg/kg/day oral pretomanid or during the 20-week post treatment recovery period. Further, no cataracts were observed in monkeys given oral pretomanid at 100 mg/kg/day for 39 weeks with a 12-week post treatment recovery. This is approximately 1- to 2-times the human exposure for a 200 mg dose (AUC).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Study 1 (NCT02333799) was an open-label study conducted in three centers in South Africa in patients with XDR, treatment‑intolerant MDR, or non-responsive MDR pulmonary TB. Fifty-six (51%) patients were HIV-positive. The patients received a combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid for 6 months (extended to 9 months in 2 patients) with 24 months of follow-up; linezolid starting dose was either 600 mg twice daily or 1200 mg once daily. One hundred seven of the 109 patients enrolled were assessable for the primary efficacy analyses with two patients remaining in follow‑up for the primary outcome assessment.</p><p>Treatment failure was defined as the incidence of bacteriologic failure (reinfection – culture conversion to positive status with different <span class="Italics">M. tuberculosis</span> strain), bacteriological relapse (culture conversion to positive status with same <span class="Italics">M. tuberculosis</span> strain), or clinical failure through follow-up until 6 months after the end of treatment. Results are presented in Table 4. Of the 107 patients assessed, outcomes were classified as success for 95 (89%) patients and failure for 12 (11%) patients. The success rate significantly exceeded the historical success rates for XDR-TB based on a literature review.
