Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5)]</span>.</p><p>After observing the response to initial therapy with naproxen delayed-release tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient’s needs.</p><p>To maintain the integrity of the enteric coating, the naproxen delayed-release tablet should not be broken, crushed or chewed during ingestion.</p><p>Naproxen-containing products such as naproxen delayed-release tablets and other naproxen products should not be used concomitantly since they all circulate in the plasma as the naproxen anion.</p><h3>Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosages of naproxen delayed-release tablets are shown in Table 1.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Table 1: Recommended dosages for Naproxen delayed-release tablets</span></p><p class="First">Naproxen delayed-release tablets</p><p class="First">375 mg<br/>
<br/>
 or 500 mg</p><p class="First">Twice daily<br/>
<br/>
Twice daily</p><p><br/>
During long-term administration, the dose of naproxen may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. A lower daily dose may suffice for long-term administration. The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and the administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily is not necessary.</p><p>The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily does not generally make a difference in response.</p><p>In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg/day for limited periods of up to 6 months when a higher level of anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity is required. When treating such patients with naproxen 1500 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset the potential increased risk.</p><h3>Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</h3><p class="First">Naproxen solid-oral dosage forms may not allow for the flexible dose titration needed in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A liquid formulation may be more appropriate for weight-based dosing and due to the need for dose flexibility in children.</p><p>In pediatric patients, doses of 5 mg/kg/day produced plasma levels of naproxen similar to those seen in adults taking 500 mg of naproxen <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]</span>. The recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses.</p><h3>Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendonitis and Bursitis</h3><p class="First">Naproxen delayed-release tablets are not recommended for initial treatment of acute pain because absorption of naproxen is delayed compared to other naproxen-containing products <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]</span>.</p><h3>Acute Gout</h3><p class="First">Naproxen delayed-release tablets are not recommended because of the delay in absorption.</p><h3>Non-Interchangeability with Other Formulations of Naproxen</h3><p class="First">Different dose strengths and formulations (e.g., tablets, suspension) of naproxen are not interchangeable. This difference should be taken into consideration when changing strengths or formulations.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Naproxen delayed-release tablets USP: 375 mg: white enteric coated, capsule-shaped, biconvex tablets de-bossed with ‘I 1’ on one side.</p><p>Naproxen delayed-release tablets USP: 500 mg: white enteric coated, capsule-shaped, biconvex tablets de-bossed with ‘I 11’ on one side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Naproxen delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in the following patients:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p><p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as naproxen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</span></p><p>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Post-MI Patients</span></p><p>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</p><p>Avoid the use of naproxen delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If naproxen delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including naproxen, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs.</p><p>Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</span><br/>
Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</p><p><span class="Bold">Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:</span></p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.</p><p>Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including naproxen.</p><p>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and “flu-like” symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue naproxen delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including naproxen delayed-release tablets can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><h3>Heart Failure and Edema</h3><p class="First">The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</p><p>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of naproxen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>Avoid the use of naproxen delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If naproxen delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Toxicity</span></p><p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.</p><p>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of naproxen delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of naproxen delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.</p><p>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating naproxen delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of naproxen delayed-release tablets <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Avoid the use of naproxen delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If naproxen delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Naproxen has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to naproxen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span>.</p><p>Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, naproxen delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. When naproxen delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including naproxen, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of naproxen delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Naproxen delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">Naproxen may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including naproxen delayed-release tablets, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with naproxen delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.</p><p>NSAIDs, including naproxen delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders, or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Masking of Inflammation and Fever</h3><p class="First">The pharmacological activity of naproxen delayed-release tablets in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><h3>Long-Term Use and Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)]</span>.</p><p>Patients with initial hemoglobin values of 10g or less who are to receive long-term therapy should have hemoglobin values determined periodically.</p><p>Because of adverse eye findings in animal studies with drugs of this class, it is recommended that ophthalmic studies be carried out if any change or disturbance in vision occurs.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Adverse reactions reported in controlled clinical trials in 960 patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis are listed below. In general, reactions in patients treated chronically were reported 2 to 10 times more frequently than they were in short-term studies in the 962 patients treated for mild to moderate pain or for dysmenorrhea. The most frequent complaints reported related to the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>A clinical study found gastrointestinal reactions to be more frequent and more severe in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking daily doses of 1500 mg naproxen compared to those taking 750 mg naproxen.</p><p>In controlled clinical trials with about 80 pediatric patients and in well-monitored, open-label studies with about 400 pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis treated with naproxen, the incidence of rash and prolonged bleeding times were greater, the incidence of gastrointestinal and central nervous system reactions were about the same, and the incidence of other reactions were lower in pediatric patients than in adults.</p><p>In patients taking naproxen in clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse experiences in approximately 1% to 10% of patients were:</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal (GI) Experiences, including:</span> heartburn*, abdominal pain*, nausea*, constipation*, diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomatitis</p><p><span class="Bold">Central Nervous System:</span> headache*, dizziness*, drowsiness*, lightheadedness, vertigo</p><p><span class="Bold">Dermatologic:</span> pruritus (itching)*, skin eruptions*, ecchymoses*, sweating, purpura</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Senses:</span> tinnitus*, visual disturbances, hearing disturbances</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular:</span> edema*, palpitations</p><p><span class="Bold">General:</span> dyspnea*, thirst</p><p>*Incidence of reported reaction between 3% and 9%.

There is reason to expect that the interaction would be present with prescription doses of naproxen or with enteric-coated low-dose aspirin; however, the peak interference with aspirin function may be later than observed in the PD study due to the longer washout period.</p><p><br/>
Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Intervention:</span></p><p class="First">Because there may be an increased risk of cardiovascular events following discontinuation of naproxen due to the interference with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin during the washout period, for patients taking low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection who require intermittent analgesics, consider use of an NSAID that does not interfere with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin, or non-NSAID analgesics where appropriate.</p><p><br/>

Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2-4% for major malformations, and 15-20% for pregnancy loss. In animal reproduction studies in rats, rabbits, and mice no evidence of teratogenicity or fetal harm when naproxen was administered during the period of organogenesis at doses 0.13, 0.26, and 0.6 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 1500 mg/day, respectively <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization.

Naproxen treatment given in late pregnancy to delay parturition has been associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension, renal dysfunction, and abnormal prostaglandin E levels in preterm infants. Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly starting at 30-weeks of gestation, or third trimester) should be avoided.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at 20 mg/kg/day (0.13 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 1500 mg/day based on body surface area comparison), rabbits at 20 mg/kg/day (0.26 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, based on body surface area comparison), and mice at 170 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparison) with no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to the drug.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for naproxen delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the naproxen delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Females</span></p><p>Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including naproxen delayed-release tablets may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including naproxen delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Pediatric dosing recommendations for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis are based on well-controlled studies <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>. There are no adequate effectiveness or dose-response data for other pediatric conditions, but the experience in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and other use experience have established that single doses of 2.5 to 5 mg/kg as naproxen suspension, with total daily dose not exceeding 15 mg/kg/day, are well tolerated in pediatric patients over 2 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The hepatic and renal tolerability of long-term naproxen administration was studied in two double-blind clinical trials involving 586 patients. Of the patients studied, 98 patients were age 65 and older and 10 of the 98 patients were age 75 and older. Naproxen was administered at doses of 375 mg twice daily or 750 mg twice daily for up to 6 months. Transient abnormalities of laboratory tests assessing hepatic and renal function were noted in some patients, although there were no differences noted in the occurrence of abnormal values among different age groups.</p><p>Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.13)]</span>.</p><p>Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear, although it is possible that the increase in free naproxen concentration could be associated with an increase in the rate of adverse events per a given dosage in some elderly patients. Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly, it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose.</p><p>Experience indicates that geriatric patients may be particularly sensitive to certain adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Elderly or debilitated patients seem to tolerate peptic ulceration or bleeding less well when these events do occur. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in the geriatric population <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p>Naproxen is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Geriatric patients may be at a greater risk for the development of a form of renal toxicity precipitated by reduced prostaglandin formation during administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in these patients. It is prudent to use the lowest effective dose <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]</span>. Because naproxen sodium may be rapidly absorbed, high and early blood levels should be anticipated. A few patients have experienced convulsions, but it is not clear whether or not these were drug-related. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life threatening <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6)]</span>.</p><p>Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</p><p>For additional information about overdosage treatment contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222).</p><h2>Naproxen Delayed Release Description</h2><p class="First">Naproxen delayed-release tablets are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs available as follows:<br/>
Naproxen delayed-release tablets USP are available as enteric coated, white tablets containing 375 mg of naproxen or 500 mg of naproxen, USP for oral administration.</p><p>Naproxen, USP is a propionic acid derivative related to the arylacetic acid group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The chemical name for naproxen, USP is (S)-6-methoxy-α-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid. Naproxen, USP has a molecular weight of 230.26 and a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">14</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>.</p><p>Naproxen has the following structural formula:</p><p>Naproxen, USP is an odorless, white to off-white crystalline substance. It is lipid-soluble, practically insoluble in water at low pH and freely soluble in water at high pH. The octanol/water partition coefficient of naproxen, USP at pH 7.4 is 1.6 to 1.8.</p><p>The inactive ingredients are croscarmellose sodium, povidone, colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate. The enteric coating dispersion contains methacrylic acid copolymer dispersion, talc, titanium dioxide, triethyl citrate and purified water. The dissolution of this enteric-coated naproxen tablet is pH dependent with rapid dissolution above pH 6. There is no dissolution below pH 4.</p><h2>Naproxen Delayed Release - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Naproxen has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.</p><p>The mechanism of action of naproxen, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</p><p>Naproxen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Naproxen concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because naproxen is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In a healthy volunteer study, 10 days of concomitant administration of naproxen 220 mg once-daily with low-dose immediate-release aspirin (81 mg) showed an interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin as measured by % serum thromboxane B2 inhibition at 24 hours following the day 10 dose [98.7% (aspirin alone) vs 93.1% (naproxen and aspirin)]. The interaction was observed even following discontinuation of naproxen on day 11 (while aspirin dose was continued) but normalized by day 13. In the same study, the interaction was greater when naproxen was administered 30 minutes prior to aspirin [98.7% vs 87.7%] and minimal when aspirin was administered 30 minutes prior to naproxen [98.7% vs 95.4%].</p><p>Following administration of naproxen 220 mg twice-daily with low-dose immediate-release aspirin (first naproxen dose given 30 minutes prior to aspirin), the interaction was minimal at 24 h following day 10 dose [98.7% vs 95.7%]. However, the interaction was more prominent after discontinuation of naproxen (washout) on day 11 [98.7% vs 84.3%] and did not normalize completely by day 13 [98.5% vs 90.7%] <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Naproxen is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with an in vivo bioavailability of 95%. The different dosage forms of naproxen are bioequivalent in terms of extent of absorption (AUC) and peak concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>); however, the products do differ in their pattern of absorption. These differences between naproxen products are related to both the chemical form of naproxen used and its formulation. Even with the observed differences in pattern of absorption, the elimination half-life of naproxen is unchanged across products ranging from 12 to 17 hours. Steady-state levels of naproxen are reached in 4 to 5 days, and the degree of naproxen accumulation is consistent with this half-life. This suggests that the differences in pattern of release play only a negligible role in the attainment of steady-state plasma levels.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Naproxen Delayed-Release Tablets:</p><p>Naproxen delayed-release tablets are designed with a pH-sensitive coating to provide a barrier to disintegration in the acidic environment of the stomach and to lose integrity in the more neutral environment of the small intestine. The enteric polymer coating selected for naproxen delayed-release tablets dissolves above pH 6. When naproxen delayed-release tablets were given to fasted subjects, peak plasma levels were attained about 4 to 6 hours following the first dose (range: 2 to 12 hours). An in vivo study in man using radiolabeled naproxen delayed-release tablets demonstrated that naproxen delayed-release tablets dissolve primarily in the small intestine rather than in the stomach, so the absorption of the drug is delayed until the stomach is emptied.</p><p>When naproxen delayed-release tablets and naproxen tablets were given to fasted subjects (n=24) in a crossover study following 1 week of dosing, differences in time to peak plasma levels (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) were observed, but there were no differences in total absorption as measured by C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Naproxen Delayed-release Tablets</span>* <span class="Bold"><br/>

At therapeutic levels naproxen is greater than 99% albumin-bound. At doses of naproxen greater than 500 mg/day there is less than proportional increase in plasma levels due to an increase in clearance caused by saturation of plasma protein binding at higher doses (average trough C<span class="Sub">ss</span> 36.5, 49.2 and 56.4 mg/L with 500, 1000 and 1500 mg daily doses of naproxen, respectively).

Approximately 95% of the naproxen from any dose is excreted in the urine, primarily as naproxen (&lt;1%), 6-0-desmethyl naproxen (&lt;1%) or their conjugates (66% to 92%). The plasma half-life of the naproxen anion in humans ranges from 12 to 17 hours. The corresponding half-lives of both naproxen’s metabolites and conjugates are shorter than 12 hours, and their rates of excretion have been found to coincide closely with the rate of naproxen clearance from the plasma. Small amounts, 3% or less of the administered dose, are excreted in the feces.

There were no adverse effects on fertility noted (up to 0.13 times the MRDH based on body surface area).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Naproxen has been studied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, tendonitis and bursitis, and acute gout. Improvement in patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis was demonstrated by a reduction in joint swelling, a reduction in duration of morning stiffness, a reduction in disease activity as assessed by both the investigator and patient, and by increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time. Generally, response to naproxen has not been found to be dependent on age, sex, severity or duration of rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>In patients with osteoarthritis, the therapeutic action of naproxen has been shown by a reduction in joint pain or tenderness, an increase in range of motion in knee joints, increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time, and improvement in capacity to perform activities of daily living impaired by the disease.</p><p>In a clinical trial comparing standard formulations of naproxen 375 mg twice a day (750 mg a day) vs 750 mg twice a day (1500 mg/day), 9 patients in the 750 mg group terminated prematurely because of adverse events. Nineteen patients in the 1500 mg group terminated prematurely because of adverse events. Most of these adverse events were gastrointestinal events.</p><p>In clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, naproxen has been shown to be comparable to aspirin and indomethacin in controlling the aforementioned measures of disease activity, but the frequency and severity of the milder gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea, dyspepsia, heartburn) and nervous system adverse effects (tinnitus, dizziness, lightheadedness) were less in naproxen-treated patients than in those treated with aspirin or indomethacin.</p><p>In patients with ankylosing spondylitis, naproxen has been shown to decrease night pain, morning stiffness and pain at rest. In double-blind studies the drug was shown to be as effective as aspirin, but with fewer side effects.</p><p>In patients with acute gout, a favorable response to naproxen was shown by significant clearing of inflammatory changes (e.g., decrease in swelling, heat) within 24 to 48 hours, as well as by relief of pain and tenderness.</p><p>Naproxen has been studied in patients with mild to moderate pain secondary to postoperative, orthopedic, postpartum episiotomy and uterine contraction pain and dysmenorrhea. Onset of pain relief can begin within 1 hour in patients taking naproxen and within 30 minutes in patients taking naproxen sodium. Analgesic effect was shown by such measures as reduction of pain intensity scores, increase in pain relief scores, decrease in numbers of patients requiring additional analgesic medication, and delay in time to remedication. The analgesic effect has been found to last for up to 12 hours.</p><p>Naproxen may be used safely in combination with gold salts and/or corticosteroids; however, in controlled clinical trials, when added to the regimen of patients receiving corticosteroids, it did not appear to cause greater improvement over that seen with corticosteroids alone. Whether naproxen has a “steroid-sparing” effect has not been adequately studied. When added to the regimen of patients receiving gold salts, naproxen did result in greater improvement. Its use in combination with salicylates is not recommended because there is evidence that aspirin increases the rate of excretion of naproxen and data are inadequate to demonstrate that naproxen and aspirin produce greater improvement over that achieved with aspirin alone. In addition, as with other NSAIDs, the combination may result in higher frequency of adverse events than demonstrated for either product alone.</p><p>Three 6-week, double-blind, multicenter studies with naproxen delayed-release tablets (375 mg or 500 mg twice a day, n=385) and naproxen tablets (375 mg or 500 mg twice a day, n=279) were conducted comparing naproxen delayed-release tablets with naproxen tablets, including 355 rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis patients who had a recent history of NSAID-related GI symptoms. These studies indicated that naproxen delayed-release tablets and naproxen tablets showed no significant differences in efficacy or safety and had similar prevalence of minor GI complaints. Individual patients, however, may find one formulation preferable to the other.</p><p>Five hundred and fifty-three patients received naproxen delayed-release tablets during long-term open-label trials (mean length of treatment was 159 days). The rates for clinically-diagnosed peptic ulcers and GI bleeds were similar to what has been historically reported for long-term NSAID use.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Naproxen Delayed-Release Tablets USP: 375 mg:</span> white enteric coated, capsule-shaped, biconvex tablets de-bossed with ‘I 1’ on one side, supplied in bottles of 100’s count (NDC 69543-425-10).</p><p><span class="Bold">Naproxen Delayed-Release Tablets USP: 500 mg:</span> white enteric coated, capsule-shaped, biconvex tablets de-bossed with ‘I 11’ on one side, supplied in bottles of 100’s count (NDC 69543-426-10).</p><p>Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F); [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p><p>Dispense in tight, light-resistant container.</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) that accompanies each prescription dispensed.
