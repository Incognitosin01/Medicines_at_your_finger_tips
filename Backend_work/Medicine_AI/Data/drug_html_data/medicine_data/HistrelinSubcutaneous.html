</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Endocrine-Metabolic Agent</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Agonist</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for histrelin</h2><p>Histrelin is a synthetic (man-made) hormone that is similar to a natural hormone that is produced in the brain. Histrelin works in the brain to reduce the blood levels of sex hormones, such as testosterone and estrogen. It is inserted just beneath the skin of the upper arm where it releases small amounts of histrelin in the body every day for 12 months.</p><p>Histrelin (<i>Vantas®</i>) is used to treat advanced prostate cancer in adults. It will reduce the level of testosterone, a male hormone, in the blood. Testosterone makes most prostate cancers grow. Histrelin is not a cure for prostate cancer, but it may help relieve the symptoms.</p><p>Histrelin (<i>Supprelin® LA</i>) is used to treat central precocious puberty (CPP) in children. CPP is a condition wherein puberty begins at an unusually early age. This usually means puberty occurs before 8 years of age in girls and before 9 years of age in boys.</p><p>Histrelin is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a trained healthcare professional.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using histrelin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For histrelin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to histrelin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>The <i>Vantas®</i> form of histrelin should not be used in children.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>Supprelin® LA</i> in children 2 years of age and older. However, use in children younger than 2 years of age is not recommended. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Supprelin® LA or Vantas®</i> in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving histrelin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using histrelin with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of histrelin</h2><p>A doctor or other trained health professional will give you histrelin. The histrelin implant will be placed under the skin in the inner area of the upper arm.</p><p>Your doctor will treat the upper arm with a numbing medicine (anesthetic) and then cut a small incision to insert the implant. The incision will be closed with either stitches or surgical strips. A pressure bandage will be placed over the arm and left in place for 24 hours.</p><p>Do not remove the surgical strips. Allow them to fall off on their own after several days. If the incision has been stitched, your doctor will remove the stitches or they will dissolve after several days.</p><p>After the implant is inserted, you should keep the arm clean and dry. Do not swim or bathe for 24 hours. You should avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous exercise for the first 7 days after the implant is inserted.</p><p>The implant will be left in place for one year (12 months) and then removed. If needed, your doctor will insert a new implant to continue treatment for another year.</p><p>Histrelin may come with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p><i>Use only the brand of histrelin that your doctor prescribed</i>. Different brands may not work the same way.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using histrelin</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check the progress of you or your child at regular visits</i> to make sure the implant is in the proper place and is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>For <i>female patients</i>: You should not receive histrelin if you are pregnant or may become pregnant. Using histrelin while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment with histrelin. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>You may have some pain, redness, or bruising at the site where the implant is placed. If your arm has not healed within 2 weeks after you received the implant or if you continue to have redness or pain, call your doctor.</p><p>For <i>children using Supprelin® LA</i>:</p><ul>
<li>The medicine can cause a brief increase in blood levels of some hormones.

If your child's symptoms do not improve within 4 weeks, or if they get worse, call your doctor.</li>
<li>Histrelin may cause some children to be agitated, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors. Make sure the doctor knows if your child is having trouble sleeping, gets upset easily, has a big increase in energy, or starts to act reckless.

If you or your caregiver notice any of these side effects, tell your doctor right away.</li>

Tell your doctor if you have any new symptoms or your symptoms get worse.</li>
<li>Histrelin may cause your blood sugar level to increase. If you are diabetic and notice a change in the results of your blood or urine sugar tests, check with your doctor.</li>
<li>Histrelin may increase your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.

<li>Contact your doctor right away if you have any changes to your heart rhythm. You might feel dizzy or faint, or you might have a fast, pounding, or uneven heartbeat. Make sure your doctor knows if you or anyone in your family has ever had a heart rhythm problem such as QT prolongation.</li>
