It is used to treat erosive esophagitis or "heartburn" caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition where the acid in the stomach washes back up into the esophagus.</p><p>Dexlansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><p>On October 17, 2017, Dexilant Solutab® (delayed-release disintegrating tablets) was withdrawn from the US market. Dexilant® and Kapidex® (delayed-release capsules) are still available.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Dexilant SoluTab</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
