<li>A high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic diseases. Examples include women who are  known to:</li>
</ul><p>-             Smoke, if over age 35 [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS (1)].</p><p>-             Have current or history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism [see WARNINGS (1)]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>-             Have cerebrovascular disease [see WARNINGS (1)]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>-             Have coronary artery disease [see WARNINGS (1)]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>-             Have thrombogenic valvular or thrombogenic rhythm diseases of the heart (for example, subacute bacterial endocarditis with valvular disease, or atrial fibrillation) [see WARNINGS (1)]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>-             Have inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathies [see WARNINGS (1)]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>-             Have uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see WARNINGS (3)]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>-             Have diabetes mellitus and are over age 35, diabetes mellitus with hypertension or vascular disease or other end-organ damage, or diabetes mellitus of &gt;20 years duration [see WARNINGS (7)]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>-             Have headaches with focal neurological symptoms, migraine headaches with aura, or over age 35 with any migraine headaches [see WARNINGS (8)]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Current or history of breast cancer or other estrogen- or progestin-sensitive cancer.</li>
<li>Liver tumors, acute viral hepatitis, or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis [see WARNINGS (2)]<span class="Italics">.</span></li>
<li>Use of Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to the potential for ALT elevations [see WARNINGS (5)]<span class="Italics">.</span></li>
<li>Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding [see WARNINGS (9)]<span class="Italics">.</span></li>
<li>Pregnancy, because there is no reason to use COCs during pregnancy [see PRECAUTIONS (6)]<span class="Italics">.</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings</h2><h3>1. Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Conditions</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Stop Ayuna if an arterial or venous thrombotic/thromboembolic event occurs.</li>
<li>Stop Ayuna if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions and evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately.</li>
<li>Discontinue Ayuna during prolonged immobilization. If feasible, stop Ayuna at least four weeks before and through two weeks after major surgery, or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism.</li>
<li>Start Ayuna no earlier than four weeks after delivery in females who are not breast-feeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the likelihood of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.</li>
<li>Before starting Ayuna evaluate any past medical history or family history of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders and consider whether the history suggests an inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathy. Ayuna is contraindicated in females with a high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic/thromboembolic diseases (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Arterial Events<br/></span></p><p>COCs increase the risk of cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. The risk is greater among older women (&gt; 35 years of age), smokers, and females with hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, or obesity.</p><p>Ayuna is contraindicated in women over 35 years of age who smoke (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked.</p><p><span class="Bold">Venous Events<br/></span></p><p>Use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Risk factors for VTEs include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). While the increased risk of VTE associated with use of COCs is well-established, the rates of VTE are even greater during pregnancy, and especially during the postpartum period (see Figure 1). The rate of VTE in females using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years.</p><p>The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of four weeks or longer. Based on results from a few studies, there is some evidence that this is true for non-oral products as well. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.</p><p>Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for females who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for females who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant females, and for females in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 females who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these females will develop a VTE.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Likelihood of Developing a VTE</span><br/>
</p><h3>2. Liver Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elevated Liver Enzymes</span></p><p>Ayuna is contraindicated in females with acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Discontinue Ayuna if jaundice develops. Acute liver test abnormalities may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until the liver tests return to normal and COC causation has been excluded.</p><p><span class="Bold">Liver Tumors</span><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>Ayuna is contraindicated in females with benign or malignant liver tumors (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). COCs increase the risk of hepatic adenomas. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death from abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt; 8 years) COC users. The attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.</p><h3>3. Hypertension</h3><p class="First">Ayuna is contraindicated in females with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). For all females, including those with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure at routine visits and stop Ayuna if blood pressure rises significantly.</p><p>An increase in blood pressure has been reported in females using COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The effect of COCs on blood pressure may vary according to the progestin in the COC.</p><h3>4. Age-related Considerations</h3><p class="First">The risk for cardiovascular disease and prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease increase with age. Certain conditions, such as smoking and migraine headache without aura, that do not contraindicate COC use in younger females, are contraindications to use in women over 35 years of age [see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS (1) ]. Consider the presence of underlying risk factors that may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or VTE, particularly before initiating a COC for women over 35 years, such as:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Hypertension</li>
<li>Diabetes</li>
<li>Dyslipidemia</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
</ul><h3>5. Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment</h3><p class="First">During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as COCs. Discontinue Ayuna prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Ayuna can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the combination drug regimen.</p><h3>6. Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">Studies suggest an increased risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease.</p><p>A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Females with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC-related cholestasis.</p><h3>7. Adverse Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hyperglycemia</span></p><p>Ayuna is contraindicated in diabetic women over age 35, or females who have diabetes with hypertension, nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, other vascular disease, or females with diabetes of &gt; 20 years duration (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Ayuna may decrease glucose tolerance. Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic females who are using Ayuna.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dyslipidemia</span></p><p>Consider alternative contraception for females with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. Ayuna may cause adverse lipid changes.</p><p>Females with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may have an increase in serum triglyceride concentrations when using Ayuna, which may increase the risk of pancreatitis.</p><h3>8. Headache</h3><p class="First">Ayuna is contraindicated in females who have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or have migraine headaches with aura, and in women over age 35 years who have migraine headaches with or without aura (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</p><p>If a woman using Ayuna develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Ayuna if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Ayuna if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraines during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).</p><h3>9. Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting</span><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>Females using Ayuna may experience unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting, especially during the first three months of use. Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy.</p><p>In two clinical trials of Ayuna  (1084 subjects reporting for a total of 8186 treatment cycles and 238 subjects reporting for a total of 1102 treatment cycles), breakthrough bleeding occurred in 6.9% and 8.1% of reported cycles, and spotting occurred in 8.6% and 7.9% of reported cycles over the total study duration, respectively. In the two trials, intermenstrual bleeding (i.e., breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting) occurred in 13.1% and 12.9% of reported cycles over the total study duration, respectively. In one trial, 33 subjects out of 1084 (3.0%) discontinued due to bleeding irregularities (i.e., breakthrough bleeding and spotting); in the other trial, 6 subjects out of 238 (2.5%) discontinued due to bleeding irregularities.</p><p><span class="Bold">Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea</span><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>Females who use Ayuna may experience absence of scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. In two clinical trials of Ayuna, one including 8186 reported treatment cycles, and the other including 1102 reported treatment cycles, amenorrhea occurred in 1.5% of treatment cycles in each trial.</p><p>If scheduled bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or two active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and perform appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.</p><p>After discontinuation of a COC, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur, especially if these conditions were pre-existent.</p><h3>10. Depression</h3><p class="First">Carefully observe females with a history of depression and discontinue Ayuna if depression recurs to a serious degree. Data on the association of COCs with onset of depression or exacerbation of existing depression are limited.</p><h3>11. Cervical Cancer</h3><p class="First">Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. There is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</p><p><span class="Bold">12. Effect on Binding Globulins</span></p><p>The estrogen component of Ayuna may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.</p><p><span class="Bold">13. Hereditary Angioedema</span></p><p>In females with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.</p><h3>14. Chloasma</h3><p class="First">Chloasma may occur with Ayuna use, especially in females with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Advise females with a history of chloasma to avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while using Ayuna.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>1. Lipid Disorders</h3><p class="First">Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult [see WARNINGS (7)].</p><p>In patients with familial defects of lipoprotein metabolism receiving estrogen-containing preparations, there have been case reports of significant elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis.</p><h3>2. Fluid Retention</h3><p class="First">Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.</p><p><span class="Bold">3. Gastrointestinal Motility</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>Diarrhea and/or vomiting may reduce hormone absorption (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p><h3>4. Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">The sections below provide information on substances for which data on drug interactions with COCs are available. There is little information available about the clinical effect of most drug interactions that may affect COCs. However, based on the known pharmacokinetic effects of these drugs, clinical strategies to minimize any potential adverse effect on contraceptive effectiveness or safety are suggested.</p><p>Consult the approved product labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for metabolic enzyme or transporter system alterations<span class="Bold">.</span></p><p>No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Ayuna.</p><p><span class="Bold">4.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs and Potentially Diminishing the Efficacy of COCs:</span></p><p>Table 1 includes substances that demonstrated an important drug interaction with Ayuna.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Significant Drug Interactions Involving Substances That Affect COCs</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Concomitant use of COCs with metabolic enzyme inducers may decrease the plasma concentrations of the estrogen and/or progestin component of COCs.</li>
<li>Decreased exposure  of the estrogen and/or progestin component of COCs may potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs and may lead to contraceptive failure or an increase in breakthrough bleeding.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>Counsel females to use an alternative method of contraception or a backup method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs.</li>
<li>Continue backup contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to maintain contraceptive reliability.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>Concomitant use of COCs with colesevelam significantly decreases systemic exposure of ethinyl estradiol.</li>
<li>Decreased exposure of the estrogen component of COCs may potentially reduce contraceptive efficacy or result in an increase in breakthrough bleeding, depending on the strength of ethinyl estradiol in the COC.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Sup">a</span> Induction potency of St. John’s wort may vary widely based on preparation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Substances increasing the systemic exposure of COCs:</span><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase systemic exposure of ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20 to 25 percent. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase systemic exposure of ethinyl estradiol, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice,<span class="Sup">7</span> or ketoconazole may increase systemic exposure of the estrogen and/or progestin component of COCs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors:</span></p><p>Significant decreases in systemic exposure of the estrogen and/or progestin have been noted when COCs are co-administered with some HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir), some HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir), and some non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., nevirapine).</p><p>In contrast, significant increases in systemic exposure of the estrogen and/or progestin have been noted when COCs are co-administered with certain other HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir) and with other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., etravirine).</p><p><span class="Bold">4.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs</span></p><p>Table 2 provides significant drug interaction information for drugs co-administered with Ayuna.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Significant Drug Interaction Information for Drugs Co-Administered With COCs</span></p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><p><span class="Bold">4.3 Effect on Laboratory Tests</span></p><p>The use of COCs may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.</p><p><span class="Bold">5. Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>See WARNINGS (11)<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>6. Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary<br/></span></p><p>Ayuna is contraindicated in pregnancy because there is no reason to use COCs in pregnancy. Discontinue Ayuna if pregnancy occurs. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or nongenital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to COCs before conception or during early pregnancy. Animal studies to evaluate embryo/fetal toxicity were not conducted.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 percent and 15 to 20 percent, respectively.</p><h3>7. Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Contraceptive hormones and/or metabolites are present in human milk. COCs can reduce milk production in breast-feeding females. This reduction can occur at any time but is less likely to occur once breast-feeding is well-established. When possible, advise the nursing female to use other methods of contraception until she discontinues breast-feeding. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)<span class="Italics">.</span> The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Ayuna and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Ayuna or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>8. Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of Ayuna have been established in females of reproductive potential. Use of Ayuna before menarche is not indicated.</p><h3>9. Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Ayuna has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population.</p><h3>10. PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Counsel patients that cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use, and that women who are over 35 years old and smoke should not use COCs.</li>
<li>Counsel patients that this product does not protect against HIV-infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections.</li>
<li>Counsel patients to take one tablet daily by mouth at the same time every day. Instruct patients what to do in the event pills are missed.</li>
<li>Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs.</li>
<li>Counsel patients who are breastfeeding or who desire to breastfeed that COCs may reduce breast milk production. This is less likely to occur if breastfeeding is well established.</li>
<li>Counsel any patient who starts Ayuna postpartum, and who has not yet had a period, to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken an orange tablet for 7 consecutive days.</li>
<li>Counsel patients that amenorrhea may occur. Pregnancy should be considered in the event of amenorrhea, and should be ruled out if amenorrhea is associated with symptoms of pregnancy, such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness.</li>

Do not use Ayuna if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old.</span> Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from hormonal birth control pills, including death from heart attack, blood clots or stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
What is Ayuna?<br/></span><br/>
Ayuna is a birth control pill (oral contraceptive) used by women to prevent pregnancy.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
How does Ayuna</span> <span class="Bold">work for contraception?<br/></span><br/>
Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your birth control pills. The better you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the results of clinical studies, about 1 to 5 out of 100 women may get pregnant during the first year they use Ayuna.<br/>
<br/>
The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Who should not take Ayuna?<br/></span> <span class="Bold"><br/>
Do not take Ayuna if you:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>smoke and are over 35 years of age</li>
<li>had blood clots in your arms, legs, lungs, or eyes</li>
<li>had a problem with your blood that makes it clot more than normal</li>
<li>have certain heart valve problems or irregular heart beat</li>
<li>had a stroke</li>
<li>had a heart attack</li>
<li>have high blood pressure that cannot be controlled by medicine</li>
<li>have diabetes with kidney, eye, nerve, or blood vessel damage</li>
<li>have certain kinds of severe migraine headaches with aura, numbness, weakness or changes in vision, or any migraine headaches if you are over 35 years of age</li>
<li>had breast cancer or any cancer that is sensitive to female hormones</li>
<li>have liver problems, including liver tumors</li>
<li>have any unexplained vaginal bleeding</li>
<li>are pregnant</li>
<li>take any Hepatitis C drug combination containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir. This may increase levels of the liver enzyme “alanine aminotransferase” (ALT) in the blood.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">If any of these conditions happen while you are taking Ayuna, stop taking Ayuna right away and talk to your healthcare provider. Use non-hormonal contraception when you stop taking Ayuna.<br/></span> <span class="Bold"><br/>

<li>are pregnant or think you may be pregnant</li>
<li>are depressed now or have been depressed in the past</li>
<li>had yellowing of your skin or eyes (jaundice) caused by pregnancy (cholestasis of pregnancy)</li>
<li>are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Ayuna may decrease the amount of breast milk you make. A small amount of the hormones in Ayuna may pass into your breast milk. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best birth control method for you while breastfeeding.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,</span> including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements.<br/>
<br/>
Ayuna may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how well Ayuna works.<br/>

<li>Take <span class="Bold">1</span> pill every day at the same time. Take the pills in the order directed on your pill pack.</li>
<li>Do not skip your pills, even if you do not have sex often. If you miss pills (including starting the pack late) <span class="Bold">you could get pregnant</span>. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant.</li>
<li>If you have trouble remembering to take Ayuna, talk to your healthcare provider.</li>
<li>When you first start taking Ayuna, spotting or light bleeding in between your periods may occur. Contact your healthcare provider if this does not go away after a few months.</li>
<li>You may feel sick to your stomach (nauseous), especially during the first few months of taking Ayuna. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If your nausea does not go away, call your healthcare provider.</li>
<li>Missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you take the missed pills later. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills (see <span class="Bold">What should I do if I miss any Ayuna</span> <span class="Bold">pills?</span> below), you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.</li>
