Tell your doctor if you are pregnant.</p><p><b>Anesthesia medicine may affect brain development in a child under 3, or an unborn baby whose mother receives  Ketalar during late pregnancy.</b> These effects may be more likely when the anesthesia is used for 3 hours or longer, or used for repeated procedures. Effects on brain development could cause learning or behavior problems later in life.</p><p>Negative brain effects from anesthesia have been seen in animal studies. However, studies in human children receiving single short uses of anesthesia have not shown a likely effect on behavior or learning. More research is needed.</p><p>In some cases, your doctor may decide to postpone a surgery or procedure based on these risks. Treatment may not be delayed in the case of life-threatening conditions, medical emergencies, or surgery needed to correct certain birth defects.</p><p>Ask your doctor for information about all medicines that will be used during your surgery or procedure. Also ask how long the procedure will last.</p><p>It may not be safe to breast-feed shortly after receiving this medicine.

Tell your caregivers if these feelings are severe or unpleasant.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since  Ketalar is usually given for anesthesia, you are not likely to be on a dosing schedule.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since Ketalar is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.
