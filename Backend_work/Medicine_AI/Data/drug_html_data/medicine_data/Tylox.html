Oxycodone is an opioid pain medication. An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic. Acetaminophen is a less potent pain reliever that increases the effects of oxycodone.</p><p>Tylox capsules are used to relieve moderate to severe pain.</p><p>Tylox may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Tylox if you have recently used alcohol, sedatives, tranquilizers, or other narcotic medications.</p><p>Do not use this medicine if you have taken an MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days. A dangerous drug interaction could occur. MAO inhibitors include isocarboxazid, linezolid, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, and tranylcypromine.</p><p>Do not take more of this medication than is recommended. An overdose of acetaminophen can damage your liver or cause death. Call your doctor at once if you have nausea, pain in your upper stomach, itching, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-colored stools, or jaundice (yellowing of your skin or eyes).</p><p>In rare cases, acetaminophen may cause a severe skin reaction. Stop taking Tylox and call your doctor right away if you have skin redness or a rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling.</p><p>Tylox may be habit forming. Never share acetaminophen and oxycodone with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Tylox if you are allergic to acetaminophen (Tylenol) or oxycodone, or if you have recently used alcohol, sedatives, tranquilizers, or other narcotic medications.</p><p>Do not use this medicine if you have taken an MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days. A dangerous drug interaction could occur.

You should not breast-feed while using this medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take Tylox?</h2><p>Take Tylox capsules exactly as prescribed. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Never take Tylox in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. An overdose can damage your liver or cause death. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain.</p><p>Drink 6 to 8 full glasses of water daily to help prevent constipation while you are taking Tylox capsule. Do not use a stool softener (laxative) without first asking your doctor.</p><p>Tylox can cause unusual results with certain urine tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using Tylox.</p><p>If you need surgery, tell the surgeon ahead of time that you are using this medicine. You may need to stop using the medicine for a short time.</p><p>Do not stop using Tylox suddenly after long-term use, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to avoid withdrawal symptoms when you stop using this medicine.</p><p>Store Tylox capsules at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>Keep track of the amount of medicine used from each new bottle. Oxycodone is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Always check your bottle to make sure you have received the correct pills (same brand and type) of medicine prescribed by your doctor. Ask the pharmacist if you have any questions about the medicine you receive at the pharmacy.</p><p>After you have stopped using this medication, flush any unused pills down the toilet. Disposal of medicines by flushing is recommended to reduce the danger of accidental overdose causing death. This advice applies to a very small number of medicines only. The FDA, working with the manufacturer, has determined this method to be the most appropriate route of disposal and presents the least risk to human safety.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Tylox is taken as needed, you may not be on a dosing schedule. If you are taking the medication regularly, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. An overdose of Tylox can be fatal.</p><p>The first signs of an acetaminophen overdose include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, sweating, and confusion or weakness. Later symptoms may include pain in your upper stomach, dark urine, and yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes.</p><p>Overdose symptoms may also include extreme drowsiness, pinpoint pupils, cold and clammy skin, muscle weakness, fainting, weak pulse, slow heart rate, coma, blue lips, shallow breathing, or no breathing</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid?</h2><p>Tylox may impair your thinking or reactions. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how Tylox will affect you.</p><p>Ask a doctor or pharmacist before using any other cold, allergy, pain, or sleep medication. Acetaminophen (sometimes abbreviated as APAP) is contained in many combination medicines. Taking certain products together can cause you to get too much acetaminophen which can lead to a fatal overdose. Check the label to see if a medicine contains acetaminophen or APAP.</p><p>Avoid drinking alcohol. It may increase your risk of liver damage while taking acetaminophen.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Tylox side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction to Tylox: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>In rare cases, acetaminophen may cause a severe skin reaction that can be fatal. This could occur even if you have taken acetaminophen in the past and had no reaction. Stop taking this medicine and call your doctor right away if you have skin redness or a rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling. If you have this type of reaction, you should never again take any medicine that contains acetaminophen.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
