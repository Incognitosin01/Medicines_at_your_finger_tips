Mechanism of action in reduction of intracranial pressure (ICP) is less clear. However, it is thought that mannitol reduces ICP by reducing blood viscosity which transiently increases cerebral blood flow and oxygen transport and constricts pial arterioles. This in turn reduces cerebral blood volume and ICP. Furthermore, mannitol reduces ICP by withdrawing water from the brain parenchyma and excretes water in the urine (Allen 1998; BTF [Carney 2016]).</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>17 L; remains confined to extracellular space (except in extreme concentrations); does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier (generally, penetration is low)</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Minimally hepatic to glycogen</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (~80% as unchanged drug)</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>Diuresis: 1 to 3 hours; Reduction in intracranial pressure: ~15 to 30 minutes </p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>Reduction in intracranial pressure: 3 to 6 hours</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>0.5 to 2.5 hours; 6 to 36 hours in renal failure</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p>Injection: Reduction of increased intracranial pressure (associated with cerebral edema and/or brain mass); reduction of increased intraocular pressure</p><p>Genitourinary irrigation solution: Irrigation in transurethral prostatic resection or other transurethral surgical procedures</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><p>Improve renal transplant function</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Injection: Hypersensitivity to mannitol or any component of the formulation; anuria; severe hypovolemia; active intracranial bleeding except during craniotomy; preexisting severe pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.</p><p>Genitourinary irrigation solution: Anuria.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral edema, reduction (off-label dosing):</b> IV: 0.25 to 1 g/kg/dose; may repeat every 6 to 8 hours as needed (BTF [Carney 2016]; Grape 2012).

For cerebral edema or elevated intracranial pressure, administer over 30 to 60 minutes. Inspect for crystals prior to administration. If crystals are present, redissolve by warming solution. Do not place mannitol 25% injection in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags; a white flocculent precipitate may form from contact with PVC surfaces. Use filter-type administration set (≤5 micron) for infusion solutions containing mannitol ≥20% (WHO 2011). Do not administer with blood. Crenation and agglutination of red blood cells may occur if administered with whole blood.</p><p>Vesicant (at concentrations &gt;5%); ensure proper catheter or needle position prior to and during IV infusion. Avoid extravasation of IV infusions. Administration into a large central vein is recommended.</p><p><b>Extravasation management:</b> If extravasation occurs, stop infusion immediately and disconnect (leave needle/cannula in place); gently aspirate extravasated solution (do <b>NOT</b> flush the line); initiate hyaluronidase antidote; remove needle/cannula; apply dry cold compresses (Hurst 2004; Reynolds 2014); elevate extremity.</p><p><i>Hyaluronidase:</i> Intradermal or SubQ: Inject a total of 1 to 1.7 mL (15 units/mL) as five separate 0.2 to 0.3 mL injections (using a tuberculin syringe) into area of extravasation at the leading edge in a clockwise manner (Reynolds 2014) <b>or</b> SubQ: Administer multiple 0.5 to 1 mL injections of a 15 units/mL solution around the periphery of the extravasation (Kumar 2003).</p><p>Irrigation: Administer using only the appropriate transurethral urologic instrumentation.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Injection: Store at controlled room temperature; do not freeze. Crystallization of solution may occur at low temperatures; do not use solutions that contain crystals. To dissolve crystals in plastic containers, heat solution up to 60°C to 70°C (140°F to 158°F) (recommended temperature may vary; refer to manufacturer’s labeling), with agitation; do not immerse in water or microwave (may contaminate or damage product); allow solution to return to room or body temperature before use. To dissolve crystals in vials/bottles, warm vial in hot water at 80°C (176°F) and periodically shake vigorously or vial may be autoclaved at 121°C (250°F) for 20 minutes at 15 psi. Allow solution to return to room or body temperature before use.</p><p>Irrigation: Store at room temperature of 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted up to 40°C.

Avoid extravasation of IV infusions; may cause compartment syndrome. Administration into a large central vein is recommended.</p><p>• Fluid/electrolyte imbalance: May cause hypervolemia and electrolyte disturbances; monitor for new onset or worsening cardiac or pulmonary congestion. Also may cause profound diuresis with fluid and electrolyte loss; close medical supervision and dose evaluation are required. Correct electrolyte disturbances; adjust dose to avoid dehydration.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Serious hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis), including fatalities, have been reported. Discontinue mannitol immediately if hypersensitivity reaction develops and treat accordingly.</p><p>• Nephrotoxicity: May cause renal dysfunction especially with high doses; use caution in patients taking other nephrotoxic agents, with sepsis or preexisting renal disease. To minimize adverse renal effects, adjust to keep serum osmolality &lt;320 mOsm/L. Discontinue if evidence of acute tubular necrosis.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cerebral edema: In patients being treated for cerebral edema, mannitol may accumulate in the brain (causing rebound increases in intracranial pressure) if circulating for long periods of time as with continuous infusion; intermittent boluses preferred. Cardiovascular status should also be evaluated; do not administer electrolyte-free mannitol solutions with blood. If hypotension occurs, monitor cerebral perfusion pressure; reassess dose and use of mannitol if cerebral perfusion pressure decreased.</p><p>• CNS effects: CNS toxicity (eg, coma, confusion, lethargy) may occur; risk may be increased in patients with impaired renal function or with concomitant use of neurotoxic drugs. Discontinue mannitol if CNS toxicity develops.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution. In patients with severe impairment, do not use until adequacy of renal function and urine flow is established; use 1 to 2 test doses to assess renal response.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Renal function, daily fluid I &amp; O, serum electrolytes, serum and urine osmolality. Monitor infusion site.</p><p>For treatment of elevated intracranial pressure, some suggest maintaining serum osmolality &lt;320 mOsm/kg due to the potential risk of acute renal tubular damage (Grape 2012; Rabenstein 2006). However, this value is routinely exceeded without ill effect. A better marker for mannitol toxicity may be the serum osmole gap and the target used by most clinicians is &lt;18 to 20 (Erstad 2016; García-Morales 2004).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Mannitol crosses the placenta.</p><p>Outcome information following surgical use in pregnancy is limited; amniotic fluid volume may be decreased (Handlogten 2015; Kazemi 2014).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p><b>Injection:</b></p><p>• It is used to lower pressure in the skull and brain.</p><p>• It is used to lower high eye pressure.</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
