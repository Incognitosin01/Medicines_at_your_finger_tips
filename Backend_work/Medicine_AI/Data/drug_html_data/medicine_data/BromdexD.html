Its structure is as follows:</p><p></p><h2>Bromdex D - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Pseudoephedrine</h3><p class="First">Pseudoephedrine acts on sympathetic nerve endings and also on smooth muscle, making it useful as a nasal decongestant. The nasal decongestant effect is mediated by the action of pseudoephedrine on α-sympathetic receptors, producing vasoconstriction of the dilated nasal arterioles. Following oral administration, effects are noted within 30 minutes with peak activity occurring at approximately one hour.</p><h3>Dextromethorphan</h3><p class="First">Dextromethorphan acts centrally to elevate the threshold for coughing. It has no analgesic or addictive properties. The onset of antitussive action occurs in 15 to 30 minutes after administration and is of long duration.</p><h3>Brompheniramine Maleate</h3><p class="First">Brompheniramine Maleate is a histamine antagonist, specifically an H<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptor-blocking agent belonging to the alkylamine class of antihistamines. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for receptor sites on effector cells. Brompheniramine also has anticholinergic (drying) and sedative effects. Among the antihistaminic effects, it antagonizes the allergic response (vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, increased mucus secretion) of nasal tissue. Brompheniramine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with peak plasma concentration after single, oral dose of 4 mg reached in 5 hours; urinary excretion is the major route of elimination, mostly as products of biodegradation; the liver is assumed to be the main site of metabolic transformation.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Bromdex D</h2><p class="First">For the temporary relief of coughs and upper respiratory symptoms, including nasal congestion, associated with allergy or the common cold.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. Do not use in the newborn, in premature infants, in nursing mothers, or in patients with severe hypertension or severe coronary artery disease. Do not use dextromethorphan in patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAOI) inhibitors (or for 14 days after stopping MAOI therapy) (see <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span>). Antihistamines should not be used to treat lower respiratory tract conditions including asthma.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Do not exceed recommended dosage.</span> If nervousness, dizziness, or sleeplessness occurs, discontinue use and consult a doctor. If symptoms do not improve within 7 days or are accompanied by a fever, consult a doctor. Do not take this product if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, thyroid disease, diabetes, glaucoma, a breathing problem such as emphysema, or chronic bronchitis, or difficulty in urination due to enlargement of the prostate gland, unless directed by your doctor. Especially in infants and small children, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions, and death. Antihistamines may diminish mental alertness. May cause excitability especially in children. May cause drowsiness; alcohol, sedatives, and tranquilizers may increase the drowsiness effect. Avoid alcoholic beverages while taking this product. Do not take this product if you are taking sedatives or tranquilizers, without first consulting your doctor. Use caution when driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Because of its antihistamine component, Bromdex D™ Syrup should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, narrow angle glaucoma, gastrointestinal obstruction, or urinary bladder neck obstruction. Because of its sympathomimetic component, Bromdex D™ Syrup should be used with caution in patients with diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, or thyroid disease.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or operating dangerous machinery. Pseudoephedrine is banned and tested for by the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Do not use if you are now taking a prescription monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) (certain drugs for depression, psychiatric, or emotional conditions, or Parkinson's disease), or for 2 weeks after stopping the MAOI drug. If you do not know if your prescription drug contains an MAOI, ask a doctor or pharmacist before taking this product. Concomitant administration of this medication in conjunction with an MAOI may cause hyperpyrexia, hypotension, or death. MAOI's also prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines and may enhance the effect of pseudoephedrine. Concomitant administration of this medication and MAOI's should be avoided (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p><h3>Central Nervous System (CNS depressants)</h3><p class="First">Antihistamines have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents, etc.).</p><h3>Antihypertensive drugs</h3><p class="First">Sympathomimetics may reduce the effects of antihypertensive drugs.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Animal studies of Bromdex D™ Syrup to assess the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential or the effect on fertility have not been performed.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Bromdex D™ Syrup. It is also not known whether Bromdex D™ Syrup can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. This product should be administered to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Because of the higher risk of intolerance of antihistamines in small infants generally, and in newborns and prematures in particular, Bromdex D™ Syrup is contraindicated in nursing mothers.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years have not been established (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most frequent adverse reactions to Bromdex D™ Syrup are: sedation; dryness of mouth, nose and throat; thickening of bronchial secretions; dizziness. Other adverse reactions may include:</p><p><span class="Bold">Dermatologic:</span> Urticaria, drug rash, photosensitivity, pruritus.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular:</span> Hypotension, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, palpitations.</p><p><span class="Bold">CNS:</span> Disturbed coordination, tremor, irritability, insomnia, visual disturbances, weakness, nervousness, convulsions, headache, euphoria, and dysphoria.</p><p><span class="Bold">Urinary System:</span> Urinary frequency, difficult urination.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal System:</span> Epigastric discomfort, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Respiratory System:</span> Tightness of chest and wheezing, shortness of breath.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hematologic System:</span> Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Central nervous system effects from overdosage of brompheniramine may vary from depression to stimulation, especially in children. Anticholinergic effects may be noted. Toxic doses of pseudoephedrine may result in CNS stimulation, tachycardia, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias; signs of CNS depression may occasionally be seen. Dextromethorphan in toxic doses will cause drowsiness, ataxia, nystagmus, opisthotonos, and convulsive seizures.</p><h3>Toxic Doses</h3><p class="First">Data suggest that individuals may respond in an unexpected manner to apparently small amounts of a particular drug. A 2½-year-old child survived the ingestion of 21 mg/kg of dextromethorphan exhibiting only ataxia, drowsiness, and fever, but seizures have been reported in 2 children following the ingestion of 13–17 mg/kg. Another 2½-year-old child survived a dose of 300–900 mg of brompheniramine, The toxic dose of pseudoephedrine should be less than that of ephedrine, which is estimated to be 50 mg/kg.</p><h3>Treatment</h3><p class="First">Induce emesis if patient is alert and is seen prior to 6 hours following ingestion. Precautions against aspiration must be taken, especially in infants and small children, Gastric lavage may be carried out, although in some instances tracheostomy may be necessary prior to lavage. Naloxone hydrochloride 0.005 mg/kg intravenously may be of value in reversing the CNS depression that may occur from an overdose of dextromethorphan, CNS stimulants may counter CNS depression. Should CNS hyperactivity or convulsive seizures occur, intravenous short-acting barbiturates may be indicated. Hypertensive responses and/or tachycardia should be treated appropriately. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated.</p><h2>Bromdex D Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults and Children 12 years of age or older:</span> 1 teaspoonful every 6 hours. <span class="Bold">Children 6 to 12 years of age:</span> ½ teaspoonful every 6 hours.
