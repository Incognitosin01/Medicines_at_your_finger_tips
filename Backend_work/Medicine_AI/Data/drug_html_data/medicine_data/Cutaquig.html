</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Cutaquig</h2><p class="First">Cutaquig (Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human) - hipp) is a 16.5% immune globulin solution for subcutaneous infusion (IGSC), indicated as replacement therapy for primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI) in adults. This includes, but is not limited to, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), X-linked agammaglobulinemia, congenital agammaglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and severe combined immunodeficiencies.</p><h2>Cutaquig Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For subcutaneous use only</span> . Do not inject into a blood vessel.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Before receiving treatment with Cutaquig: Obtain the patient's serum Immunoglobulin G (IgG) trough level to guide subsequent dose adjustments (see Dose Adjustment ).</li>
</ul><h3>Dose</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Individualize the dose based on the patient’s pharmacokinetic and clinical response. Monitor serum IgG trough levels regularly to guide subsequent dose adjustments as needed (see Dose Adjustment ).</li>
<li>Start Cutaquig treatment one week after the last IGIV/IGSC infusion.</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Dose for patients switching to Cutaquig from IGIV:</span></span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Ensure that patients have received Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV) treatment at regular intervals for at least 3 months.</li>
<li>Establish the initial weekly dose of Cutaquig by converting the monthly IGIV dose into an equivalent weekly dose and increasing it using a dose adjustment factor.</li>
<li>To calculate the initial weekly dose of Cutaquig, divide the monthly IGIV dose in grams by the number of weeks between IGIV infusions and then multiply this value with a Dose Adjustment Factor of 1.40.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>To convert the dose (in grams) to milliliters (mL), multiply the calculated dose (in grams) by 6.</li>
<li>Provided the total weekly dose is maintained, any dosing interval from daily up to weekly can be used and will result in systemic IgG exposure that is comparable to the previous IGIV treatment.</li>
<li>On average, serum IgG trough levels were approximately 23% higher during Cutaquig administration compared to those obtained during prior IGIV therapy.</li>
<li>To guide dose adjustments, see Table 1 under Dose Adjustment .</li>
</ul><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Dose for patients switching to Cutaquig from IGSC:</span></span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Ensure that patients have received IGSC at regular intervals for at least 3 months before switching to Cutaquig.</li>
<li>It is recommended to maintain the same weekly dosing (in grams) of Cutaquig that was used for the previous Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human) (IGSC) therapy (in grams).</li>
<li>To convert the dose (in grams) to milliliters (mL), multiply the calculated dose (in grams) by 6.</li>
<li>Obtain a trough IgG level before switching, monitor clinical response and check the trough IgG level 2 to 3 months after initiating Cutaquig.</li>
<li>To guide dose adjustments, see Table 1 under Dose Adjustment , if the trough IgG level during Cutaquig administration differs from the trough IgG level obtained during treatment with the previously administered IGSC product or target trough level.</li>
</ul><p> <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Dose Adjustment:</span></span></p><p>Over time the dose may need to be individualized for each patient, dependent on the pharmacokinetic and clinical response and on the desired IgG trough level. Measure the patient’s serum IgG trough level 2-3 months after switching to Cutaquig or after the last Cutaquig dose adjustment, in order to determine if a dose adjustment is necessary.</p><p>Calculate the difference between the patient’s target serum IgG trough level (in mg/dL) and the IgG trough level obtained during subcutaneous treatment with Cutaquig. Find this difference in column 1 of Table 1 and locate the corresponding adjustment amount of Cutaquig in mL/administration according to the body weight of the patient.</p><p>Use the patient’s clinical response as primary point to consider for any dose adjustment. Additional dose increments may be indicated based on the patient's clinical response (i.e., infection frequency and severity).</p><p> <span class="Bold">Table 1 Incremental adjustment (mL) of weekly Cutaquig dosing based on the calculated difference between actual IgG trough level and the target trough level for the patient*</span></p><p><span class="Sup">*</span> Derived from a linear regression model of trough levels and weekly dose per kg body weight.</p><p>For example: a patient with body weight of 70 kg is treated weekly and has a trough level of 600 mg/dL, but the target trough level is 900 mg/dL The difference between the actual trough level (600) and the desired trough level (900) is plus 300 mg/dL. Therefore, the recommended increase in the weekly dose would be 37 mL.</p><p>Monitor the patient’s clinical response and periodically check trough IgG levels, and repeat dose adjustment as needed.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Measles Exposure</span></span></p><p>If a patient has been exposed to measles, it may be prudent to administer a dose of Immune Globulin Intravenous as soon as possible and within 6 days of exposure. A dose of 400 mg/kg should provide a serum level &gt; 240 mIU/mL of measles antibodies for at least two weeks.</p><p>If a patient is at risk of future measles exposure and receives a dose of less than 245 mg/kg subcutaneously per week, the dose should be increased to 245 mg/kg.</p><h3>Preparation</h3><p class="First">Cutaquig is a clear and colorless solution that may turn to slightly opalescent and pale yellow during storage. Do not use the solution if it appears cloudy or contains particulates.</p><ul class="Disc">

<li>In patients who have had an anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to the subcutaneous administration of human immune globulin or to any of the components of Cutaquig such as Polysorbate 80.</li>
<li>In IgA-deficient patients with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity to human globulin treatment.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur with Cutaquig, even in patients who tolerated previous treatment with human immune globulin. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue the Cutaquig infusion immediately and initiate appropriate treatment. Have epinephrine immediately available to treat any severe acute hypersensitivity reaction.</p><p>IgA-deficient patients with known anti-IgA antibodies have a higher risk of developing potentially severe hypersensitivity and/or anaphylactic reactions (including anaphylaxis and shock) with administration of Cutaquig. Cutaquig contains ≤ 0.6 mg of IgA /mL.</p><h3>Thrombosis</h3><p class="First">Thrombosis may occur following treatment with immune globulin products, including Cutaquig. Risk factors may include: advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling central vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. Thrombosis may occur in absence of known risk factors.</p><p>Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, such as those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triglycerides, or monoclonal gammopathies. For patients at risk of thrombosis, administer Cutaquig at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity. [see Boxed Warning , Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]</p><h3>Falsely Elevated Glucose Readings</h3><p class="First">Blood Glucose Testing: Some types of blood glucose testing systems (for example, those based on the glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinolinequinone (GDH-PQQ) or glucose-dye-oxidoreductase methods) falsely interpret the maltose contained in Cutaquig as glucose. This may potentially result in falsely elevated glucose readings and, consequently, in the inappropriate administration of insulin, resulting in life-threatening hypoglycemia. Also, cases of true hypoglycemia may go untreated if the hypoglycemic state is masked by falsely elevated glucose readings. Accordingly, when administering Cutaquig, measure blood glucose with a glucose-specific method. The product information of the blood glucose testing system, including that of the test strips, should be carefully reviewed to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral products. If any uncertainty exists, contact the manufacturer of the testing system to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral products.</p><h3>Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS)</h3><p class="First">Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome can occur with Cutaquig. AMS has been reported after the use of human immune globulin administered intravenously and subcutaneously. It usually begins a few hours to 2 days following treatment and occurs more frequently in females than in males.</p><p>AMS is characterized by the following signs and symptoms: severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, nausea and vomiting. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies frequently show pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per mm <span class="Sup">3</span> , predominantly from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred milligram/dL, but negative culture results. To rule out other causes of meningitis, conduct a thorough neurological examination on patients showing such symptoms and signs, including CSF studies. Discontinuation of immunoglobulin treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae.</p><h3>Renal Dysfunction/Failure</h3><p class="First">Acute renal dysfunction/failure, acute tubular necrosis, proximal tubular nephropathy, osmotic nephrosis and death may occur with use of human immune globulin, especially those containing sucrose. Cutaquig does not contain sucrose. Ensure that patients are not volume-depleted before administration of Cutaquig.</p><p>In patients at risk of developing renal dysfunction because of any degree of preexisting renal insufficiency or predisposition to acute renal failure (such as diabetes mellitus, age greater than 65 years, volume depletion, sepsis, paraproteinemia, or patients receiving known nephrotoxic drugs) monitor renal function and consider lower, more frequent dosing [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 <span class="Italics">), Patient Counseling Information</span> ( 17 )].</p><p>Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to have a potential increased risk of developing acute renal failure. Assess renal function, including measurements of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, before the initial infusion of Cutaquig and again at appropriate intervals thereafter. If renal function deteriorates, consider discontinuing Cutaquig.</p><h3>Hemolysis</h3><p class="First">IgG products, including Cutaquig, can contain blood group antibodies that may act as hemolysins and induce <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> coating of red blood cells (RBCs) with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs’) test result. Delayed hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to immune globulin therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration, and acute hemolysis, consistent with intravascular hemolysis, has been reported.</p><p>Monitor Cutaquig recipients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis, particularly patients with risk factors (such as non-O blood group, administration of high IgG doses (≥ 2g/kg BW)). Underlying inflammatory state in a patient may increase the risk of hemolysis but its role is uncertain. Consider appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing if signs and symptoms of hemolysis are present after Cutaquig infusion.</p><h3>Transfusion-related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)</h3><p class="First">Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema may occur in patients administered human immune globulin products. TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever. Typically, it occurs within 1 to 6 hours following transfusion.</p><p>Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions. If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient’s serum. Patients with TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support.</p><h3>Transmittable Infectious Agents</h3><p class="First">Because Cutaquig is made from human plasma, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) agent and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have been associated with the use of Cutaquig. All infections suspected by a physician to have possibly been transmitted by Cutaquig should be reported to Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985.</p><h3>Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">After infusion of Cutaquig, the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the patient’s blood may yield false positive serological test results, with the potential for misleading interpretation. Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens (e.g.. A, B, and D) may cause a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin (Coombs’) test.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most common adverse reactions (AR) observed in ≥ 5% of study subjects were local infusion site adverse reactions (such as redness, swelling, and itching), and, as systemic adverse reactions, headache, fever, diarrhea, dermatitis, asthma, and skin abrasion.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Clinical safety data are based on an open-label, single arm, prospective, multicenter major effectiveness study of Cutaquig in subjects with primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI), previously treated with Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV) for at least 6 months. This study was conducted in Europe and North America.</p><p>Overall, the 61 subjects in the Safety Analysis Set received 3497 infusions in the study, with a mean of 57 infusions administered per subject. The average dose of Cutaquig used per subject was 0.185 g/kg in adult subjects, 0.135 g/kg in young children, 0.160 g/kg in older children and 0.172 g/kg in adolescents.</p><p>Excluding infections, a total of 50 subjects (82%) experienced 950 adverse reactions (ARs, defined as adverse events occurring during or within 72 hours of infusion or any adverse events otherwise causally related). Of the 950 ARs 814 were infusion site reactions. Forty-three subjects (70.5%) had at least one systemic AR. The proportion of infusions with adverse reactions was 0.27.</p><p>Local reactions were the most common ARs and were experienced by 46 subjects (75.4%). The rate of infusion site reaction per infusion was 0.23. Most local ARs were either mild (transient AR causing discomfort but not interfering with routine activities [89.4%]) or moderate (AR sufficiently discomforting to interfere with routine activities [10.3%]) in intensity.</p><p>Table 3 summarizes adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects (defined as adverse events occurring during or within 72 hours of infusion or any adverse events otherwise considered causally related event occurring within the study period).</p><p> <span class="Bold">Table 3 Adverse reactions* in ≥ 5% of subjects and rate per infusion</span></p><p>* Excluding infections.</p><p>** Rate = total number of adverse reactions divided by total number of infusions.</p><p>In the study, the most frequent infusion site reactions were redness, swelling, and itching. During the study period the incidence of local reactions decreased over time from 38% of infusions triggering an infusion site reaction during the first 4 infusions to around 15% of infusions with an infusion site reaction during the last 4 infusions.</p><p>No adverse events (AEs) led to withdrawal of subject from the study and none led to discontinuation of the study medication.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">There is no post-marketing experience with Cutaquig. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of immune globulins. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Table 4 summarizes adverse reactions that have been reported during post-marketing use of immune globulin products and may also occur after Cutaquig administration:</p><p> <span class="Bold">Table 4 Adverse reactions reported during post-marketing use of immune globulin products</span></p><p>To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Octapharma USA Inc. at 1-866-766-4860 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Serological Testing</h3><p class="First">Various passively transferred antibodies in immunoglobulin preparations may lead to misinterpretation of results of serological testing.</p><h3>Live Virus Vaccines</h3><p class="First">The passive transfer of antibodies with immunoglobulin administration may interfere with the response to live virus vaccines such as measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. Inform the immunizing physician of recent therapy with Cutaquig so that appropriate precautions can be taken. [See Patient Counselling Information ( 17 )]</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>No human data are available to indicate the presence or absence of drug-associated risk. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Cutaquig. It is not known whether Cutaquig can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Immune globulins cross the placenta from maternal circulation increasingly after 30 weeks of gestation. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk summary</span></p><p>No human data are available to indicate the presence or absence of drug associated risk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Cutaquig and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Cutaquig or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of Cutaquig have not been established in patients under 17 years of age. There are only limited data available on the safety and efficacy of Cutaquig administration in pediatric patients. Cutaquig was evaluated in 23 pediatric subjects (15 children, 8 adolescents) with primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI).</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Cutaquig did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Three study subjects enrolled in the clinical trial were 65 years and over. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h2>Cutaquig Description</h2><p class="First">Cutaquig (Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human) - hipp), is a solvent/detergent (S/D)-treated, sterile preparation of highly purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) derived from large pools of human plasma. Cutaquig is a solution for injection to be administered subcutaneously.</p><p>This preparation contains approximately 165 mg of protein per mL (16.5%), of which not less than 96% is normal human immunoglobulin G. Cutaquig contains not more than 3% aggregates, not less than 94% monomers and dimers, and not more than 3% fragments. On average, the product contains ≤ 0.6 mg of IgA /mL.</p><p>The sodium content of the final solution is not more than 30 mmol/L and the pH is between 5.0 and 5.5. The osmolality is 310 - 380 mOsmol/kg.</p><p>The manufacturing process for Cutaquig isolates IgG without additional chemical or enzymatic modification, and the Fc portion is maintained intact. Cutaquig contains the IgG antibody activities present in the donor population. IgG subclasses are fully represented with the following approximate percents of total IgG: IgG1 is 70%, IgG2 is 25%, IgG3 is 3% and IgG4 is 2%.</p><p>Cutaquig contains a broad spectrum of IgG antibodies against bacterial and viral agents that are capable of opsonization and neutralization of microbes and toxins. It contains maltose (79 mg/mL), but no preservatives or sucrose.</p><p>All units of human plasma used in the manufacture of Cutaquig are provided by FDA-approved blood and plasma establishments, and are tested by FDA-licensed serological tests for HBsAg, antibodies to HCV and HIV and Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) for HCV and HIV-1 and found to be non-reactive (negative).</p><p>The product is manufactured by the cold ethanol fractionation process followed by ultrafiltration and chromatography. The manufacturing process includes treatment with an organic S/D mixture composed of tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP) and Octoxynol. The Cutaquig manufacturing process shows significant viral reduction in in vitro studies ( Table 5 ). These reductions are achieved through a combination of process steps including cold ethanol fractionation, S/D treatment and pH 4 treatment.</p><p> <span class="Bold">Table 5 Pathogen Reduction During Cutaquig Manufacturing</span></p><p>* Not calculated for global LRF</p><p>HIV-1: Human Immunodeficiency Virus - 1</p><p>PRV: Pseudorabies Virus, model virus for e.g. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)</p><p>SBV: Sindbis Virus model virus for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)</p><p>MEV: Mouse Encephalomyelitis Virus, model virus for Human Parvovirus B19</p><p>PPV: Porcine Parvovirus, model virus for Hepatitis A Virus (HAV)</p><p>n.a.: not applicable</p><h2>Cutaquig - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Cutaquig supplies a broad spectrum of opsonizing and neutralizing Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against a wide variety of bacterial and viral agents. It has a distribution of immune globulin subclasses closely proportional to that in native human plasma. The mechanism of action in primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI) has not been fully elucidated; however adequate doses may restore abnormally low immune globulin G levels to the normal range and thus help in preventing infections.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Cutaquig contains mainly IgG with a broad spectrum of antibodies against various infectious agents reflecting the IgG activity found in the donor population. Cutaquig which is prepared from pooled material from not less than 1000 donors, has an IgG subclass distribution similar to that of native human plasma. Adequate doses of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human) (IGSC) can restore an abnormally low IgG level to the normal range. Standard pharmacodynamic studies were not performed.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">A pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-study was conducted in 18 adult subjects who were enrolled in the 61-subject safety and efficacy study. Blood samples for PK study were collected prior to switching to Cutaquig (IGIV profile: PK <span class="Sub">IV</span> ), after the 11 <span class="Sup">th</span> infusion of Cutaquig (first SC profile: PK <span class="Sub">SC1</span> ) and after the 28th infusion of Cutaquig (second SC profile: PK <span class="Sub">SC2</span> ). The objective of the PK sub-study was to compare the AUCs following the IV and SC administration. At steady state, the geometric mean of the ratio (SC2:IV) was 1.02, (90% CI: 0.96, 1.08), indicating comparable exposure between IGSC and IGIV treatment (standardized to a 7-day period). Dose conversion factors from IGIV to IGSC of individual subjects ranged from 1.24 to 1.89 (mean: 1.40).</p><p>Serum IgG and IgG subclass trough levels were nearly constant during the IGSC phase of the study, with higher mean levels after SC treatment compared with those following IGIV. At the end of the IGIV period, trough levels ranged from 5.8 g/L to 13.9 g/L. Over the entire IGSC treatment period individual trough levels of total IgG ranged between 6.1 g/L to 24.0 g/L.</p><p>Table 6 summarizes the Key PK parameters for Cutaquig.</p><p> <span class="Bold">Table 6 Key Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Cutaquig and IGIV in Adults</span></p><p><span class="Sup">#</span> T <span class="Sub">max</span> is presented as Median (range)</p><p>* standardized to a 7-day period</p><p><span class="Sup">+</span> apparent clearance (CL/F) for Cutaquig (F = bioavailability)</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No animal studies were conducted with Cutaquig to assess carcinogenesis, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Safety of Cutaquig has been demonstrated in several standard nonclinical toxicology studies (local tolerance in rabbits, cardiovascular and respiratory effects in dogs, thrombogenic potential in rabbits).</p><p>The product given subcutaneously to CD1 mice inoculated with Streptococcus pneumoniae showed a dose related improvement in survival.</p><p>TNBP and Octoxynol may be found in Cutaquig in trace amounts. In animals and in vitro studies, these compounds were not genotoxic and did not have mutagenic properties. They did not show teratogenic effects when administered to pregnant rabbits and rats during organogenesis.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The study was a prospective, open-label, non-controlled, single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, tolerability and safety of subcutaneous human immunoglobulin (Cutaquig) in subjects with primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI).</p><p>The study was conducted in 61 subjects (38 adult and 23 pediatric subjects &lt; 16 years of age) who received weekly SC infusions with Cutaquig during a 12-week wash-in/wash-out period followed by a 12-month efficacy period during which efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and quality of life (QoL) parameters of Cutaquig were evaluated. At the time of data analysis, 47 subjects (35 adults; 12 pediatric subjects) had completed the study, 8 pediatric subjects were continuing in the study, and 6 subjects (3 adults; 3 pediatric subjects) had discontinued the study prematurely at the time of data analysis.</p><p>During the efficacy period the mean weekly dose was 175 mg/kg BW, with individual doses ranging from 60 to 390 mg/kg BW. The median duration of infusion per week was 1.5 hours.</p><p>All enrolled subjects (n=61) were included in the Safety Analysis Set and the Full Analysis Set (FAS). Four subjects were excluded from the Per-Protocol (PP) Set because they terminated early before the start of the primary treatment period.</p><p>Overall, 33 female subjects and 28 male subjects participated in this study. The youngest subject enrolled in the study was 2 years old and the oldest was 73 years old. The mean age in the adult group (16–75 yrs) was 46.6 years. Reported race was white for all but one subject, and all subjects were of not Hispanic/Latino ethnicity.</p><p>The main objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of Cutaquig in preventing serious bacterial infections (SBI defined as bacteraemia/sepsis, bacterial meningitis, osteomyelitis/septic arthritis, bacterial pneumonia and visceral abscess). This endpoint was considered successful if the upper bound of the 99% confidence interval for the rate of SBIs was &lt; 1.0 per subject-year of follow up. This criterion was met, as no SBIs were reported at any time during the study.</p><p>Other endpoints of the study included, but were not limited to: the number of episodes of any other infections, along with type and severity of infection and time to resolution; number of days of use and annual rate of antibiotics; absence and number of days of absence from work/school/ kindergarten/day care; and hospitalisations due to infections and number of days and annual rate of hospitalisation.</p><p>Efficacy results are summarized in Table 7 .</p><p> <span class="Bold">Table 7 Summary of efficacy results (FAS set).</span></p><p>* Defined as bacterial pneumonia, bacteremia/septicemia, osteomyelitis/septic arthritis, bacterial meningitis, and visceral abscess.</p><p><span class="Sup">#</span> Upper one-sided 99% confidence limit: 0.08.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Cutaquig is supplied in 1 g, 1.65 g, 2 g, 3.3 g, 4 g or 8 g single-use vials.</p><ul class="Disc">

Please read it carefully before using Cutaquig and each time you get a refill, as there may be new information. This Patient Information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. If you have any questions after reading this, ask your healthcare provider.</p><p><span class="Bold">What is Cutaquig?</span></p><p>Cutaquig is a ready-to-use liquid solution of Immunoglobulin G (IgG), also called antibodies, which protect the body against infection. Cutaquig is used to treat patients with primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI).</p><p>There are many forms of PI. The most common types of PI result in an inability to make a very important type of protein called antibodies, which help the body fight off infections from bacteria or viruses. Regular administration of Cutaquig will help your body to fight bacteria and viruses that cause infections. Cutaquig is made from human plasma that is donated by healthy people. Cutaquig contains antibodies collected from these healthy people; these antibodies replace the missing antibodies in PI patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Who should NOT use Cutaquig?</span></p><p>Do not use Cutaquig if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to immune globulin or other blood products.</p><p>Tell your healthcare provider if you:</p><ul class="Disc">

If you need to do glucose testing, your healthcare provider may tell you to use a different way to monitor your blood sugar levels on the day that you receive a Cutaquig infusion. Some types of blood glucose testing systems (so called glucometers) falsely interpret the maltose contained in Cutaquig as glucose. If you are uncertain ask your healthcare provider which glucose testing system you can use while using Cutaquig.</p><p><span class="Bold">How should I use Cutaquig?</span></p><p>Cutaquig is given under the skin (subcutaneously).
