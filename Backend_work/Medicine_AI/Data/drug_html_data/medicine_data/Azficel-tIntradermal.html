</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of azficel-t</h2><p>A trained doctor will give you azficel-t in a hospital or clinic. Azficel-t is given through a small needle placed into your nasolabial fold wrinkles.</p><p>Your doctor will take three small skin samples (called biopsies) from behind your ears and send them to the manufacturer. Certain cells are grown from these samples for 3 to 6 months.</p><p>The processed cells (Laviv®) are shipped back by the manufacturer to your doctor. Your doctor will check and confirm if it came from your own skin. Then, your doctor will inject your medicine into the nasolabial fold wrinkles.</p><p>Azficel-t is usually given in 3 doses, spaced 3 to 6 weeks apart.</p><p>After treatment with azficel-t:</p><ul>
<li>Apply a cold compress for 2 to 3 minutes at a time if needed to ease swelling or discomfort. Do not apply ice directly to the face.</li>
