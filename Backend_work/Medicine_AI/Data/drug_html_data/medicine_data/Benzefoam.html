Also contains: Propellant HFA-134A (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane).</p><p>Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent that possesses antibacterial properties and is classified as a keratolytic. Benzoyl peroxide (C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">10</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>) is represented by the following structure:</p><p> </p><h2>Benzefoam - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The exact method of action of benzoyl peroxide in acne vulgaris is not known. Benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial agent with demonstrated activity against <span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes</span>. This action, combined with the mild keratolytic effect of benzoyl peroxide, is believed to be responsible for its usefulness in acne. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is metabolized to benzoic acid and excreted as benzoate in the urine.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Benzefoam</h2><p class="First">Benzefoam Emollient Foam is indicated for use in the topical treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Benzefoam Emollient Foam should not be used in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to benzoyl peroxide or to any of the other ingredients in the product. Discontinue use if hypersensitivity is observed.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.</span> Not For Ophthalmic Use. When using this product, avoid unnecessary sun exposure and use a sunscreen. <span class="Bold">Keep out of the reach of children.</span> Contents under pressure. Do not puncture or incinerate container. Do not expose to temperatures above 120°F (49°C).</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">If severe irritation develops, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">This medication is to be used as directed by a physician and should not be used to treat any condition other than that for which it was prescribed. Avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, lips, and mucous membranes. If accidental contact occurs, rinse with water. If excessive redness or irritation develops, discontinue use and consult your physician. <span class="Bold">AVOID CONTACT WITH HAIR, FABRICS OR CARPETING AS BENZOYL PEROXIDE WILL CAUSE BLEACHING OR DICOLORATION.</span></p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Based upon all available evidence, benzoyl peroxide is not considered to be a carcinogen. However, data from a study using mice known to be highly susceptible to cancer suggest that benzoyl peroxide acts as a tumor promoter. The clinical significance of the findings is not known.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with benzoyl peroxide. It is also not known whether benzoyl peroxide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Benzoyl peroxide should be used by a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in the human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when benzoyl peroxide is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Allergic contact dermatitis and dryness have been reported with topical benzoyl peroxide therapy.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">If excessive scaling, erythema or edema occurs, the use of this preparation should be discontinued. To hasten resolution of the adverse effects, cool compresses may be used. After symptoms and signs subside, a reduced dosage schedule may be cautiously tried if the reaction is judged to be due to excessive use and not allergenicity.</p><h2>Benzefoam Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For Proper Dispensing of Foam, Shake Vigorously and Tap Bottom of Can Before Each Use. Prime Container Before Initial Use:</span> Shake Vigorously. After shaking, gently tap bottom of can onto palm of other hand or a solid surface at least 3 times. Remove cap.
