<li>500 mg enteric-coated naproxen and 20 mg immediate-release esomeprazole tablets printed with 500/20 in black.</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in the following patients:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions) to naproxen, esomeprazole magnesium, substituted benzimidazoles, or to any components of the drug product, including omeprazole. Hypersensitivity reactions to esomeprazole may include anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, and urticaria <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8, 5.9,5.17), Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span> .</li>
<li>History of asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, sometimes fatal, anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8)]</span> .</li>
<li>In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> .</li>
<li>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including esomeprazole magnesium, are contraindicated in patients receiving rilpivirine-containing products <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span> .</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDS. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p><p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as naproxen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</span></p><p>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Post-MI Patients</span></p><p>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute    rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death    in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years after follow-up.</p><p>Avoid the use of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including naproxen, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine,or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</span></p><p>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</p><p><span class="Bold">Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.</li>
<li>Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.</li>
<li>Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such as patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.</li>
<li>Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.</li>
<li>If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.</li>
<li>In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span> .</li>
</ul><p>NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of the normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, and sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.</p><p>Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including naproxen.</p><p>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</p><p>Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6),</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablet, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre- existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events.Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazides diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><h3>Heart Failure and Edema</h3><p class="First">The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</p><p>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of naproxen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>Avoid the use of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of worsening heart failure.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Toxicity</span></p><p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly.</p><p>Discontinuation of NSAID therapy was usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.</p><p>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span> Avoid the use of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal failure. If naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Naproxen has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to naproxen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma <span class="Italics">[see</span> C<span class="Italics">ontraindications</span> <span class="Italics">(4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span>.</p><p>Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. When naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including naproxen, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative</p><p>dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">Naproxen may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.</p><p>NSAIDs, including naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase the risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Masking of Inflammation and Fever</h3><p class="First">The pharmacological activity of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablet in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><h3>Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and chemistry profile periodically <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)].</span></p><p>Patients with initial hemoglobin values of 10 g or less who are to receive long-term therapy should have hemoglobin values determined periodically.</p><h3>Active Bleeding</h3><p class="First">When active and clinically significant bleeding from any source occurs in patients receiving naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets, the treatment should be withdrawn.</p><h3>Concomitant NSAID Use</h3><p class="First">Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablet contains naproxen as one of its active ingredients. It should not be used with other naproxen-containing products since they all circulate in the plasma as the naproxen anion.</p><p>The concomitant use of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets with any dose of a non-aspirin NSAID should be avoided due to the potential for increased risk of adverse reactions.</p><h3>Presence of Gastric Malignancy</h3><p class="First">In adults, response to gastric symptoms with naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional gastrointestinal follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who experience gastric symptoms during treatment with naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets or have a symptomatic relapse after completing treatment. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.</p><h3>Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis</h3><p class="First"> <span class="following_xmChange">Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea, anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia).</span></p><p> <span class="following_xmChange">Discontinue naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN. [<span class="Italics">see Contraindication (4)</span>]</span></p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First">Published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy like naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets may be associated with an increased risk of <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><p>Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)].</span></p><h3>Bone Fracture</h3><p class="First">Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to the established treatment guidelines <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)</span>, <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p>Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets (a combination PPI/NSAID) are approved for use twice a day and does not allow for administration of a lower daily dose of the PPI <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)].</span></p><h3>Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</h3><p class="First">Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including esomeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI- induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE.</p><p>The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy inpatients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.SLE is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.</p><p>Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets, discontinue drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.</p><h3>Interaction with Clopidogrel</h3><p class="First">Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as esomeprazole, that inhibit CYP2C19 activity. Concomitant use of clopidogrel with 40 mg esomeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel. When using esomeprazole, a component of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets, consider alternative anti-platelet therapy <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency</h3><p class="First">Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) caused by hypo-or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid- suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed.</p><h3>Hypomagnesemia</h3><p class="First">Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.</p><p>For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Concomitant use of St. John’s Wort or Rifampin with Naproxen and Esomeprazole Magnesium Delayed-Release Tablets</h3><p class="First">Drugs that induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (such as St. John's Wort or rifampin) can substantially decrease esomeprazole concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets with St. John's Wort or rifampin <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Interactions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors</h3><p class="First">Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Providers should temporarily stop esomeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g. for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Concomitant Use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole Magnesium Delayed-Release Tablets with Methotrexate</h3><p class="First">Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Fundic Gland Polyps</h3><p class="First">            PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long‑term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

Neonatal/early postnatal (birth to weaning) survival was decreased at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). Body weight and body weight gain were reduced and neurobehavioral or general developmental delays in the immediate post-weaning timeframe were evident at doses equal to or greater than 69 mg /kg/day (about 17 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis).

Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole and limited data from published literature suggest omeprazole may be present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of naproxen or omeprazole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Females</span></p><p>Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles that may lead to reversible infertility in some women. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets have been established in adolescent patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 38 kg for the symptomatic relief of JIA and to decrease the risk of developing naproxen-associated gastric ulcers. Use of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets in this age group is based on extrapolation of adequate and well-controlled studies in adults and supported by a 6 month safety study including pharmacokinetic assessment of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium in 36 adolescent patients with JIA. Based on the limited data, the plasma naproxen and plasma esomeprazole concentrations were found to be within the range to that observed to those found in healthy adults. The safety profile of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets in adolescent patients with JIA was similar to adults with RA.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age or less than 38 kg with JIA have not been established.</p><p><span class="Bold">Juvenile Animal Data</span></p><p>In a juvenile rat toxicity study, esomeprazole was administered with both magnesium and strontium salts at oral doses about 34 to 68 times a daily human dose of 40 mg based on body surface area.

If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.13)]</span>.</p><p>Of the total number of patients who received naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets (n=1157) in clinical trials, 387 were ≥65 years of age, of which 85 patients were 75 years and over. No meaningful differences in efficacy or safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)].</span></p><p>Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly, it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration</span> <span class="Italics">(2)</span>, <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>Experience indicates that geriatric patients may be particularly sensitive to certain adverse effects of NSAIDs. Elderly or debilitated patients seem to tolerate peptic ulceration or bleeding less well when these events do occur.

The inactive ingredients are carnauba wax, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, iron oxide yellow, glyceryl monostearate, hypromellose, iron oxide black, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer dispersion, methylparaben, polysorbate 80, polydextrose, polyethylene glycol, povidone, propylene glycol, propylparaben, titanium dioxide, and triethyl citrate.</p><p>The chemical name for naproxen is (S)-6-methoxy-α-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid. Naproxen has the following structure:</p><p>Naproxen has a molecular weight of 230.26 and a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">14</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>.Naproxen is an odorless, white to off-white crystalline substance. It is lipid soluble, practically insoluble in water at low pH and freely soluble in water at high pH. The octanol/water partition coefficient of naproxen at pH 7.4 is 1.6 to 1.8.</p><p>The chemical name for esomeprazole is bis(5-methoxy-2-[(S)-[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2- pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1<span class="Italics">H</span>-benzimidazole-1-yl) magnesium trihydrate. Esomeprazole is the S- isomer of omeprazole, which is a mixture of the S- and R- isomers. Its molecular formula is (C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">18</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>S)<span class="Sub">2</span> Mg x 3 H<span class="Sub">2</span>O with molecular weight of 767.2 as a trihydrate and 713.1 on an anhydrous basis. The structural formula is:</p><p>The magnesium salt is a white to slightly colored crystalline powder. It contains 3 moles of water of solvation and is slightly soluble in water.</p><p>The stability of esomeprazole magnesium is a function of pH; it rapidly degrades in acidic media, but it has acceptable stability under alkaline conditions. At pH 6.8 (buffer), the half-life of the magnesium salt is about 19 hours at 25°C and about 8 hours at 37°C.</p><h2>Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets consists of an immediate-release esomeprazole magnesium layer and an enteric-coated naproxen core. As a result, esomeprazole is released first in the stomach, prior to the dissolution of naproxen in the small intestine. The enteric coating prevents naproxen release at pH levels below 5.5.</p><p>The mechanism of action of the naproxen anion, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</p><p>Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties contributed by the naproxen component. Naproxen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Naproxen concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because naproxen is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to an increase of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p><p>Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole is protonated and converted in the acidic compartment of the parietal cell forming the active inhibitor, the achiral sulphenamide. By acting specifically on the proton pump, esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity. This effect is dose-related up to a daily dose of 20 to 40 mg and leads to inhibition of gastric acid secretion.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Interaction with Aspirin</span></p><p>In a healthy volunteer study, 10 days of concomitant administration of naproxen 220 mg once-daily with low-dose immediate-release aspirin (81 mg) showed an interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin as measured by % serum thromboxane B<span class="Sub">2</span> inhibition at 24 hours following the day 10 dose [98.7% (aspirin alone) vs 93.1% (naproxen and aspirin)].

In the same study, the interaction was greater when naproxen was administered 30 minutes prior to aspirin [98.7% vs 87.7%] and minimal when aspirin was administered 30 minutes prior to naproxen [98.7% vs 95.4%].</p><p>Following administration of naproxen 220 mg twice-daily with low-dose immediate-release aspirin (first naproxen dose given 30 minutes prior to aspirin), the interaction was minimal at 24 h following day 10 dose [98.7% vs 95.7%]. However, the interaction was more prominent after discontinuation of naproxen (washout) on day 11 [98.7% vs 84.3%] and did not normalize completely by day 13 [98.5% vs 90.7%] <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antisecretory Activity</span></p><p>The effect of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets on intragastric pH was determined in 25 healthy volunteers in one study.

The maximum dose used was 0.28 times the highest recommended human dose. No evidence of tumorigenicity was found.</p><p><span class="Italics">Esomeprazole</span></p><p>The carcinogenic potential of esomeprazole was assessed using omeprazole studies, of which esomeprazole is an enantiomer. In two 24-month oral carcinogenicity studies in rats, omeprazole at daily doses of 1.7, 3.4, 13.8, 44 and 140.8 mg/kg/day (about 0.41 to 34.2 times the human dose of 40 mg/day expressed on a body surface area basis) produced gastric ECL cell carcinoids in a dose-related manner in both male and female rats; the incidence of this effect was markedly higher in female rats, which had higher blood levels of omeprazole. Gastric carcinoids seldom occur     in the untreated rat. In addition, ECL cell hyperplasia was present in all treated groups of both sexes. In one of these studies, female rats were treated with 13.8 mg omeprazole/kg/day (about 3.36 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) for 1 year, then followed for an additional year without the drug. No carcinoids were seen in these rats. An increased incidence of treatment-related ECL cell hyperplasia was observed at the end of 1 year (94% treated vs 10% controls). By the second year the difference between treated and control rats was much smaller (46% vs 26%) but still showed more hyperplasia in the treated group. Gastric adenocarcinoma was seen in one rat (2%). No similar tumor was seen in male or female rats treated for 2 years. For this strain of rat no similar tumor has been noted historically, but a finding involving only one tumor is difficult to interpret. A 78-week mouse carcinogenicity study of omeprazole did not show increased tumor occurrence, but the study was not conclusive.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Esomeprazole was negative in the Ames mutation test, in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> rat bone marrow cell chromosome aberration test, and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus test.

In patients with osteoarthritis, the therapeutic action of naproxen has been shown by a reduction in joint pain or tenderness, an increase in range of motion in knee joints, increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time, and improvement in capacity to perform activities of daily living impaired by the disease.
