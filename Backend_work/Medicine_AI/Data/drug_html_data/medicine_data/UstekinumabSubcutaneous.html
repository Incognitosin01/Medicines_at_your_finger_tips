</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of ustekinumab</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you ustekinumab. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins or as a shot under your skin, usually on the upper arms, buttocks, stomach, or thighs.</p><p>Ustekinumab comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Ustekinumab injection may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital or clinic. If you are using ustekinumab at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you how to prepare and inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand how to use the medicine.</p><p>You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections. Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, red, bruised, or hard.</p><p>Ustekinumab is available in two forms: a <i>prefilled syringe</i> or a <i>vial (glass container)</i>. You can use these forms at home.</p><p>You might not use all of the medicine in each vial or prefilled syringe. Use each vial or prefilled syringe only one time. Do not save an open vial or syringe. If the medicine in the vial or syringe has changed color, or if you see particles in it, do not use it. Do not shake.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of ustekinumab will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of ustekinumab. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Missed dose</h3><p>Ustekinumab needs to be given on a fixed schedule. If you miss a dose or forget to use your medicine, call your doctor or pharmacist for instructions.</p><h3>Storage</h3><p>Keep out of the reach of children.</p><p>Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.</p><p>Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.</p><p>Store in the refrigerator. Do not freeze.</p><p>Keep the medicine in the original carton until you are ready to use it. Store the <i>vials</i> in an upright position.</p><p>Do not reuse syringes and needles. Put used syringes and needles in a puncture-resistant disposable container, or dispose of them as directed by your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using ustekinumab</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that ustekinumab is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Ustekinumab may cause serious infections (eg, bacteria, fungus, virus). Check with your doctor right away if you have stomach pain, fever, itching, pain or redness of the skin, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, chills, confusion, dizziness, fast heartbeat, bone pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite, weakness, bleeding in the eye, blurred vision, trouble breathing, tightness in the chest, sneezing, or cough.</p><p>You will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start using ustekinumab. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis test or been exposed to tuberculosis.</p><p>Ustekinumab may increase your risk of getting some forms of cancer (eg, non-melanoma skin cancer). This is more likely to occur if you are over 60 years of age or if you are receiving PUVA therapy (psoralen and ultraviolet A treatment) or medicines that weaken the immune system (eg, steroids) in the past. Talk to your doctor about this risk if you have concerns.</p><p>Ustekinumab may cause serious types of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema. These can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after receiving the medicine.</p><p>Check with your doctor if you have headache, seizures, confusion, or blurred vision or other visual problems. These may be symptoms of a rare and serious condition called reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS).</p><p>Ustekinumab may cause non-infectious pneumonia (eg, interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia). Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain, cough, fever or chills, sneezing, sore throat, trouble breathing, or tightness in the chest.</p><p>The needle cover of the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you have a latex allergy before you start receiving ustekinumab.</p><p>While you are being treated with ustekinumab and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (especially live vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Ustekinumab may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, the other persons living in your household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also avoid persons who have recently taken oral polio vaccine. Do not get close to them or stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective mask that covers the nose and mouth. Tell your doctor if you have received a BCG vaccine.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Ustekinumab side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
