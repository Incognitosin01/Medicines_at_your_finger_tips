</ul><h2>ClindaCure Description</h2><p class="First">ClindaCure contains clindamycin hydrochloride which is the hydrated salt of clindamycin. Clindamycin is a semisynthetic antibiotic produced by a 7(S)-chlorosubstitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of a naturally produced antibiotic produced by <span class="Italics">Streptomyces lincolnensis var. lincolnensis.</span></p><p>ClindaCure (For Use in Dogs and Cats) is a palatable formulation intended for oral administration. Each mL of ClindaCure contains clindamycin hydrochloride equivalent to 25 mg clindamycin; and ethyl alcohol, 8.64%.</p><h3>ACTIONS</h3><p class="First">Clindamycin is an inhibitor of protein synthesis in the bacterial cell. The site of binding appears to be in the 50S sub-unit of the ribosome. Binding occurs to the soluble RNA fraction of certain ribosomes, thereby inhibiting the binding of amino acids to those ribosomes. Clindamycin differs from cell wall inhibitors in that it causes irreversible modification of the protein-synthesizing subcellular elements at the ribosomal level.</p><h3>MICROBIOLOGY</h3><p class="First">Clindamycin is a lincosaminide antimicrobial agent with activity against a wide variety of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial pathogens. Clindamycin is a bacteriostatic compound that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal sub-unit. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Gram-positive and obligate anaerobic pathogens isolated from dogs and cats in the United States are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. Bacteria were isolated in 1998-1999. All MICs were performed in accordance with the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS).</p><h2>PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3>Absorption</h3><p class="First">Clindamycin hydrochloride is rapidly absorbed from the canine and feline gastrointestinal tract.</p><h3>Dog Serum Levels</h3><p class="First">Serum levels at or above 0.5 μg/mL can be maintained by oral dosing at a rate of 2.5 mg/lb of clindamycin hydrochloride every 12 hours. This same study revealed that average peak serum concentrations of clindamycin occur 1 hour and 15 minutes after oral dosing. The elimination half-life for clindamycin in dog serum was approximately 5 hours. There was no bioactivity accumulation after a regimen of multiple oral doses in healthy dogs.</p><h3>Cat Serum Levels</h3><p class="First">Serum levels at or above 0.5 μg/mL can be maintained by oral dosing at a rate of 5 mg/lb of clindamycin hydrochloride liquid every 24 hours. The average peak serum concentration of clindamycin occurs approximately 1 hour after oral dosing. The elimination half-life of clindamycin in feline serum is approximately 7.5 hours. In healthy cats, minimal accumulation occurs after multiple oral doses of clindamycin hydrochloride, and steady-state should be achieved by the third dose.</p><h3>METABOLISM AND EXCRETION</h3><p class="First">Extensive studies of the metabolism and excretion of clindamycin hydrochloride administered orally in animals and humans have shown that unchanged drug and bioactive and bioinactive metabolites are excreted in urine and feces. Almost all of the bioactivity detected in serum after clindamycin hydrochloride administration is due to the parent molecule (clindamycin). Urine bioactivity, however, reflects a mixture of clindamycin and active metabolites, especially N-dimethyl clindamycin and clindamycin sulfoxide.</p><h2>ANIMAL SAFETY SUMMARY</h2><h3>Rat and Dog Data</h3><p class="First">One year oral toxicity studies in rats and dogs at doses of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day (13.6, 45.5 and 136.4 mg/lb/day) have shown clindamycin hydrochloride capsules to be well tolerated.</p><p>Differences did not occur in the parameters evaluated to assess toxicity when comparing groups of treated animals with contemporary controls. Rats administered clindamycin hydrochloride 600 mg/kg/day (272.7 mg/lb/day) for six months tolerated the drug well; however, dogs orally dosed at 600 mg/kg/day (272.7 mg/lb/day) vomited, had anorexia, and subsequently lost weight. At necropsy these dogs had erosive gastritis and focal areas of necrosis of the mucosa of the gall bladder.</p><p>Safety in gestating bitches or breeding males has not been established.</p><h3>Cat Data</h3><p class="First">The recommended daily therapeutic dose range for clindamycin hydrochloride (ClindaCure) is 11 to 33 mg/kg/day (5 to 15 mg/lb/day) depending on the severity of the condition. Clindamycin hydrochloride (ClindaCure) was tolerated with little evidence of toxicity in domestic shorthair cats when administered orally at 10× the minimum recommended therapeutic daily dose (11 mg/kg; 5 mg/lb) for 15 days, and at doses up to 5× the minimum recommended therapeutic dose for 42 days. Gastrointestinal tract upset (soft feces to diarrhea) occurred in control and treated cats with emesis occurring at doses 3× or greater than the minimum recommended therapeutic dose (11mg/kg/day; 5 mg/lb/day). Lymphocytic inflammation of the gallbladder was noted in a greater number of treated cats at the 110 mg/kg/day dose level than for control cats. No other effects were noted. Safety in gestating queens or breeding male cats has not been established.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">ClindaCure (for use in dogs and cats) is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below:</p><h3>Dogs</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Skin infections (wounds and abscesses)</span> due to: coagulase positive staphylococci <span class="Italics">(Staphylococcus aureus</span> or <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus intermedius).</span> <span class="Bold">Deep wounds and abscesses</span> due to <span class="Italics">Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium ecrophorum</span> and <span class="Italics">Clostridium perfringens.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Dental infections</span> due to <span class="Italics">Staphyloccus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium necrophorum</span> and <span class="Italics">Clostridium perfringens.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Osteomyelitis</span> due to <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium necrophorum</span> and <span class="Italics">Clostridium pefringens</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Osteomyelitis</span> due to <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium necrophorum</span> and <span class="Italics">Clostridium perfringens.</span></p><h3>Cats</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Skin infections (wounds and abscesses)</span> due to <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, Streptococcus</span> spp. <span class="Bold">Deep wounds and infections</span> due to <span class="Italics">Clostridium perfringens</span> and <span class="Italics">Bacteroides fragilis.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Dental infections</span> due to <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, Streptococcus</span> spp., <span class="Italics">Clostridium perfringens</span> and <span class="Italics">Bacteroides fragilis.</span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">ClindaCure is contraindicated in animals with a history of hypersensitivity to preparations containing clindamycin or lincomycin.</p><p>Because of potential adverse gastrointestinal effects, do not administer to rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, horses, chinchillas or ruminating animals.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Keep out of reach of children.
