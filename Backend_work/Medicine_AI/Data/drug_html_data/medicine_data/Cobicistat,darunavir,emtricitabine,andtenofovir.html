Use all medications properly to control your infection. HIV can be passed to your baby if the virus is not controlled during pregnancy. Your name may be listed on a registry to track any effects of antiviral medicine on the baby.</p><p><b>If you do not plan to get pregnant,</b> ask your doctor about using a non-hormonal birth control (condom, diaphragm with spermicide) to prevent pregnancy. Symtuza can increase certain side effects when taken with hormonal birth control (pills, injections, implants, skin patches, vaginal rings).</p><p>Women with HIV or AIDS should not breastfeed a baby. Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk.</p><h2>How should I take Symtuza?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Always take this medicine with food.</p><p>If you cannot swallow a tablet whole, you may break the tablet in half. Take both halves right away.</p><p>Use all HIV medications as directed and read all medication guides you receive. Do not change your dose or dosing schedule without your doctor's advice. Every person with HIV should remain under the care of a doctor.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>Keep the tablets in their original container, along with the packet or canister of moisture-absorbing preservative.</p><p>If you've ever had hepatitis B, this virus may become active or get worse in the months after you stop using Symtuza. You may need frequent liver function tests while using this medicine and for several months after your last dose.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at one time.</p><p>Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking Symtuza?</h2><p>Using  cobicistat, darunavir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir will not prevent your disease from spreading.
