</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for this Medicine</h2><p>Rectal corticosteroids are used to treat mild or moderate ulcerative colitis. They also may be used along with systemic (oral or injection) corticosteroids or other medicines to treat severe disease or mild to moderate disease that has spread too far to be treated effectively by medicine inserted into the rectum alone. Rectal corticosteroids also are used to help relieve swelling, itching, and discomfort of some other rectal problems, including hemorrhoids and inflammation of the rectum caused by radiation therapy.</p><p>Rectal corticosteroids are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using this Medicine</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Children and teenagers who must use this medicine should be checked often by their doctor. Rectal corticosteroids may be absorbed through the lining of the rectum and, rarely, may affect growth, especially if used in large amounts or for a long time. Before using this medicine in children, you should discuss its use with the child's doctor.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of rectal corticosteroids in the elderly with use in other age groups, these medicines are not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than they do in younger adults.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Betamethasone may change the number and ability of movement of sperm in men. Budesonide crosses the placenta. It is not known whether other rectal corticosteroids cross the placenta. Studies in animals have shown that budesonide, hydrocortisone, and hydrocortisone acetate cause birth defects. Rectal corticosteroids should not be used in large amounts or for a long time by women who are pregnant or who are planning to become pregnant.</p><h3>Breast Feeding</h3><p>It is not known whether rectal corticosteroids pass into breast milk. However, systemic (oral and injection) corticosteroids pass into breast milk and may cause problems with growth in nursing babies. It may be necessary for you to take a different medicine or to stop breast-feeding during treatment. Be sure you have discussed with your doctor the risks and benefits of using the medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with Medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with Food/Tobacco/Alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other Medical Problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Acute psychosis—This condition may be made worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Chickenpox (including recent exposure) or</li>
<li>Measles (including recent exposure)—Risk of severe disease affecting other parts of the body.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Type 2 diabetes mellitus—Corticosteroids may cause a loss of control of diabetes by increasing blood glucose (sugar).</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Glaucoma—Corticosteroids may cause the pressure within the eye to increase.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Heart disease or</li>
<li>Hypertension (high blood pressure) or</li>
<li>Kidney disease or</li>
<li>Myasthenia gravis or</li>
<li>Overactive thyroid or</li>
<li>Swelling of blood vessels—Corticosteroids should be used with caution.</li>
</ul><ul>

</ul><ul>
<li>Ileocolostomy, postsurgical or</li>
<li>Infection or</li>
<li>Tuberculosis (active TB, nonactive TB, or past history of)—Corticosteroids may cause slower healing, worsen existing infections, or cause new infections.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Liver disease or</li>
<li>Underactive thyroid—With these conditions, the body may not eliminate the corticosteroid at the usual rate; therefore, the medicine's effect may be increased.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Osteoporosis—Corticosteroids may worsen osteoporosis because they cause the body to lose more calcium.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Other stomach or intestine problems or</li>
<li>Severe ulcerative colitis—Corticosteroids may cover up symptoms of a worsening stomach or intestinal condition; a patient would not know if his or her condition was getting worse and would not get medical help when needed.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Stomach ulcer—Corticosteroids may worsen this condition by causing an increase in the amount of acid in the stomach.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of this Medicine</h2><p><i>It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i>.</p><p>For patients using the <i>enema</i> form of this medicine:</p><ul>
<li>This medicine usually comes with patient directions. Read and follow them carefully before using this medicine.</li>
</ul><p>For patients using the <i>foam</i> form of this medicine:</p><ul>
<li>This medicine is used with a special applicator. Do not insert any part of the aerosol container into the rectum.</li>
</ul><p>For patients using the <i>suppository</i> form of this medicine:</p><ul>
<li>If the suppository is too soft to insert, chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or run cold water over it before removing the wrapper.</li>

</ul><p><i>Do not use rectal corticosteroids in larger amounts, more often, or for a longer time than your doctor ordered</i>. To do so may increase the chance of absorption through the lining of the rectum and the chance of side effects.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients.
