Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Do not add additives directly to the fat emulsion. When preparing parenteral nutrition admixture, do not add fat emulsion to the TPN container first; destabilization of the lipid emulsion may occur when other solutions (eg, dextrose) are added. Minimize pH-related problems by ensuring that dextrose solutions, which are typically acidic, are not mixed with lipid emulsions alone. First transfer dextrose solution to the TPN admixture container; then transfer amino acid injection; then transfer lipid emulsion. Amino acid injection, dextrose injection, and lipid emulsions may be simultaneously transferred to the admixture container; use gentle agitation during admixing to minimize localized concentration effects; may shake bags gently after each addition. Do not use administration sets and lines that contain di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP).</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IV: Administer by IV infusion only via peripheral line or by central venous infusion. All fat emulsion infusions should be filtered whether part of an admixture or infused separately using a 1.2-micron in-line filter only (ISMP 2016). At the onset of therapy, the patient should be observed for any immediate allergic reactions such as dyspnea, cyanosis, and fever. Change tubing after each infusion. May be simultaneously infused with carbohydrate/amino acid solutions by means of Y-connector located near infusion site or administered in total nutrient mixtures (3-in-1) with amino acids, dextrose, and other nutrients. Fat emulsions of 30% should only be administered in total nutrient mixtures (3-in-1) with amino acids, dextrose, and other nutrients. Hang fat emulsion higher than other fluids (has low specific gravity and could run up into other lines).</p><p>Clinolipid: Prior to opening the overwrap of Clinolipid, check the color of the oxygen indicator and compare to the reference color next to the OK symbol. If the color of the oxygen absorber/indicator does not correspond to the reference color, do not use. After opening the bag, use the contents immediately and do not store for a subsequent infusion. Do not connect flexible bags in series to avoid air embolism due to possible residual gas contained in the primary bag. Do not use vented administration sets with vent in the open position to avoid air embolism. When preparing total parenteral nutrition admixture, do not use the EXACTAMIX Inlet H938173 with an EXACTAMIX compounder to transfer Clinolipid injection; EXACTAMIX Inlet H938174 is recommended.</p><p>Intralipid: Prior to opening the overwrap, the integrity indicator should be inspected. If the indicator is black, the overwrap is damaged; do not use.</p><p>Nutrilipid: To avoid air embolism, use a nonvented infusion set or close the air vent on a vented set and use a dedicated line without any connections. Prior to opening the overwrap, the oxygen indicator should be inspected; if the indicator is pink or dark pink, do not use. May be infused concurrently into the same vein as carbohydrate-amino acid solutions by means of a Y-connector located near the infusion site; flow rates of each solution should be controlled separately by infusion pumps. Do not use administration sets and lines that contain di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). See prescribing information for detailed administration information.</p><p><i>Caloric source/EFAD:</i> Initiate infusions of 10% emulsions at 1 mL/minute for 15 to 30 minutes; if no untoward effects occur, the infusion rate may be increased to 2 mL/minute. Initiate infusions of 20% emulsions at 0.5 mL/minute for 15 to 30 minutes; if no untoward effects occur, the infusion rate may be increased to 1 mL/minute.</p><p><i>Serious hemodynamic or other instability secondary to highly lipid soluble substances (off-label use):</i> Administer initial bolus over 1 to 3 minutes followed by a continuous infusion. Chest compressions should continue during administration if patient is in cardiac arrest. Some experts recommend a decreased infusion rate in patients who respond favorably to the initial bolus and infusion (ACMT 2016); repeat bolus or an increase in the infusion rate may be considered if instability persists or recurs. (ACMT 2016; AHA [Lavonas 2015]; ASRA [Neal 2018]).</p><h2>Dietary Considerations</h2><p>Phosphorus: ~1.5 mMol /100 mL of emulsion</p><p>Caloric content: 10% fat emulsion = 1.1 kcal/mL; 20% fat emulsion = 2 kcal/mL; 30% fat emulsion = 3 kcal/mL</p><p>Fat emulsion should not exceed 60% of the total daily calories.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Do not freeze. If accidentally frozen, discard. Do not store partly used containers; fat emulsion can support the growth of various organisms. Do not use if the emulsion appears to be oiling out. Once the closure is penetrated, the contents should be used as soon as possible; the transfer of contents to suitable TPN admixture containers must be completed within 4 hours of closure penetration. Admixtures prepared using fat emulsion should be used promptly or stored under refrigeration at 2Â°C to 8Â°C (36Â°F to 46Â°F) for 24 hours or less and used completely within 24 hours after removal from refrigeration.</p><p>Intralipid, Nutrilipid: Store below 25Â°C (77Â°F).</p><p>Clinolipid: Store at 20Â°C to 25Â°C (68Â°F to 77Â°F); excursions permitted between 15Â°C and 30Â°C (59Â°F and 86Â°F). Avoid excessive heat. Store in overpouch until ready to use.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Endocrine and metabolic: Hyperlipidemia (â‰¤10%), hyperglycemia (2% to 10%)</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Nausea (â‰¤10%), vomiting (â‰¤10%)</p><p>Hematologic &amp; oncologic: Hypoproteinemia (2% to 10%)</p><p>Hepatic: Abnormal hepatic function tests (2% to 10%)</p><p>Frequency not defined:</p><p>Cardiovascular: Thrombophlebitis</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Cholestasis (central lobular), melanosis (brown fat pigmentation in the reticuloendothelial system)</p><p>Genitourinary: Urinary tract infection</p><p>Hematologic &amp; oncologic: Leukopenia, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia</p><p>Hepatic: Fat overload syndrome, hepatomegaly, increased liver enzymes</p><p>Infection: Septicemia</p><p>Miscellaneous: Fever</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Back pain, chest pain, cyanosis, decreased INR, diaphoresis, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, dyspnea, flushing, headache, hypercoagulability state, hypersensitivity reaction, increased body temperature, infusion site irritation, pruritus, pulmonary embolism (fat), sensation of eye pressure</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">ALERT: U.S. Boxed Warning</h2><p>Deaths in preterm infants after infusion of IV lipid emulsions have been reported in the medical literature. Autopsy findings included intravascular fat accumulation in the lungs. Preterm infants and low birth weight infants have poor clearance of IV lipid emulsion and increased free fatty acid plasma levels following lipid emulsion infusion.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects</i></b></p><p>â€¢ Fat overload syndrome: Although rare, a reduced or limited ability to metabolize lipids accompanied by prolonged plasma clearance resulting in a sudden deterioration in the patient's condition accompanied by fever, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulation disorders, hyperlipidemia, liver fatty infiltration (hepatomegaly), deteriorating liver function, and CNS (eg, coma) can occur; usually reversible upon discontinuation.</p><p>â€¢ Hepatic effects: Parenteral nutrition: Although the exact etiology is unknown and likely multifactorial, parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD) has been reported in patients receiving parenteral nutrition for extended periods of time, especially preterm infants, and can present as cholestasis or steatohepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis, possibly leading to hepatic failure; cholecystitis and cholelithiasis have also been observed. Consider discontinuation or dose reduction in patients who develop abnormal LFTs.</p><p>â€¢ Hypersensitivity: Allergic reactions (eg, tachypnea, dyspnea, hypoxia, bronchospasm, tachycardia, vomiting, headache, sweating) to lipid emulsion may occur; discontinue infusion immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions occur.</p><p>â€¢ Refeeding syndrome: Parenteral nutrition: Refeeding severely undernourished patients with parenteral nutrition may result in the refeeding syndrome (eg, intracellular shift of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium as the patient becomes anabolic); thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop. Carefully monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increase their nutrient intakes, while avoiding overfeeding.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>â€¢ Anemia: The use of fat emulsion has been associated with anemia likely due to hemodilution (Zellner 1967). Use with caution in patients with anemia.</p><p>â€¢ Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders.</p><p>â€¢ Fat embolism: Use with caution in patients who may be at danger for fat embolism.</p><p>â€¢ Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.</p><p>â€¢ Pancreatitis: Use with caution in patients with pancreatitis without hyperlipidemia; ensure triglyceride levels remain &lt;400 mg/dL.</p><p>â€¢ Respiratory disease: Use with caution in patients with respiratory disease.</p><p>â€¢ Renal impairment: Use with caution; some formulations may contain aluminum, which may accumulate following prolonged administration in renally impaired patients.</p><p>â€¢ Toxicity secondary to highly lipid soluble substances: Hemodynamic and other instability: Successful resuscitation following the administration of fat emulsion has been reported in animal studies and several human case reports in which cardiovascular toxicity was unresponsive to conventional resuscitation and antidotal measures. Successful resuscitation following the administration of fat emulsion has been reported in pediatric patients (Fuzaylov 2010; Ludot 2008; Shah 2009; Wong 2010). Consider use when toxicity secondary to a highly lipid soluble substance is likely and conventional methods are unsuccessful. Continue CPR throughout treatment with lipid emulsion. Consultation with a medical toxicologist or poison control center is highly recommended.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>â€¢ Pediatric: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Deaths in preterm infants after infusion of IV lipid emulsions have been reported in the medical literature. Autopsy findings included intravascular fat accumulation in the lungs. Preterm infants and low birth weight infants have poor clearance of IV lipid emulsion and increased free fatty acid plasma levels following lipid emulsion infusion. </b>To avoid hyperlipidemia and/or fat deposition, do not exceed recommended daily doses and consider administering less than the maximum recommended doses in preterm and small for gestational age infants. Clinolipid is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Pediatric clinical studies did not establish that Clinolipid provides sufficient amounts of essential fatty acids (EFA) in pediatric patients, which may predispose them to neurologic complications due to EFA insufficiency. Because free fatty acids displace bilirubin from albumin binding sites, the use of lipid infusions in jaundiced or premature infants should be done with caution.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>â€¢ Aluminum: The parenteral product may contain aluminum; toxic aluminum concentrations may be seen with high doses, prolonged use, or renal dysfunction. Premature neonates are at higher risk due to immature renal function and aluminum intake from other parenteral sources. Parenteral aluminum exposure of &gt;4 to 5 mcg/kg/day is associated with CNS and bone toxicity; tissue loading may occur at lower doses (Federal Register 2002). See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>â€¢ Administration: The too-rapid administration of fat emulsion can cause fluid and/or fat overloading, resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states, pulmonary edema, impaired pulmonary diffusion capacity, or metabolic acidosis; hourly infusion rate should be as low as possible.</p><p>â€¢ Three-in-one mixtures: Lipid emulsion in a three-in-one mixture may obscure the presence of a precipitate; follow compounding guidelines, especially for calcium and phosphate additions.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection (including vascular access device complications); fluid and electrolyte status; serum osmolarity; blood glucose; blood counts (including platelets and coagulation parameters); signs and symptoms of essential fatty acid deficiency, refeeding syndrome,  and/or hypersensitivity reactions.</p><p>Monitor liver and renal function tests periodically. Monitor triglycerides before initiation of lipid therapy and at least weekly during therapy (or until triglycerides are stable and when changes are made in the amount of fat administered; ASPEN Guidelines, 2002); monitor especially closely in premature infants, septic infants, and patients with pancreatitis or liver disease.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Indications for fat emulsion therapy in pregnant women are the same as in nonpregnant women. The ASPEN guidelines for parenteral and enteral nutrition state that intravenous fat emulsion may be used safely in pregnant women to provide calories and prevent essential fatty acid deficiency (ASPEN Guidelines 2002). Medications used for the treatment of cardiac arrest in pregnancy are the same as in the nonpregnant woman. Doses and indications should follow current Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support guidelines. Appropriate medications should not be withheld due to concerns of fetal teratogenicity (AHA [Jeejeebhoy 2015]). Lipid emulsion therapy has been used successfully in the resuscitation of a pregnant female with suspected bupivacaine toxicity (Dun-Chi Lin 2017; Spence 2007).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>â€¢ It is used to aid diet needs.</p><p>â€¢ It is used to give nutrition to the body.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
