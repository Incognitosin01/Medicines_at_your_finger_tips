</ul><p class="First">(Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% and Sulfur 4%)</p><p><span class="Bold">Rx only</span></p><h2>Claris Clarifying Wash Description</h2><p class="First">Each mL of CLARIS™ CLARIFYING WASH contains 100 mg of Sodium Sulfacetamide and 40 mg of Sulfur in an emulsion base containing Butylated Hydroxytoluene, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Disodium Oleamido MEA Sulfosuccinate, Fragrance, Glyceryl Stearate and PEG 100 Stearate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Methyl Paraben, Propyl Paraben, Purified Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Sodium Thiosulfate, Stearyl Alcohol, Urea 10% and Xanthan Gum.</p><p>Sodium Sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide with antibacterial activity while sulfur acts as a keratolytic agent. Chemically, Sodium Sulfacetamide is N-{(4-aminophenyl)sulfony}-acetamide, monosodium salt, monohydrate.</p><p>The structural formula is:</p><h2>Claris Clarifying Wash - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides in the Woods-Fildes theory which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth. While absorption through intact skin has not been determined, Sodium Sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine, largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours.</p><p>The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown, but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of Propionibacterium acnes and the formation of free fatty acids.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Claris Clarifying Wash</h2><p class="First">CLARIS™ CLARIFYING WASH is indicated in the topical control of acne vulgaris, acne rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">CLARIS™ CLARIFYING WASH is contraindicated for use by patients having known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, sulfur or any other component of this preparation. CLARIS™ CLARIFYING WASH is not to be used by patients with kidney disease.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Although rare, sensitivity to Sodium Sulfacetamide may occur. Therefore, caution and careful supervision should be observed when prescribing this drug for patients who may be prone to hypersensitivity to topical sulfonamides. Systemic toxic reactions such as agranulocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, purpura hemorrhagica, drug fever, jaundice, and contact dermatitis indicate hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Particular caution should be employed if areas of denuded or abraded skin are involved. <span class="Bold">FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.</span> Keep out of reach of children. Keep bottle tightly closed.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">If irritation develops, use of the product should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Patients should be very carefully observed for possible local irritation or sensitization during long-term therapy. The object of this therapy is to achieve desquamation without irritation, but Sodium Sulfacetamide and Sulfur can cause reddening and scaling of the epidermis. These side effects are not unusual in the treatment of acne vulgaris, but patients should be cautioned about the possibility.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis an Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with CLARIS™ CLARIFYING WASH. It is also not known whether CLARIS™ CLARIFYING WASH can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. CLARIS™ CLARIFYING WASH should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether Sodium Sulfacetamide is excreted in human milk following topical use of CLARIS™ CLARIFYING WASH. However, small amounts of orally administered sulfonamides have been reported to be eliminated in human milk. In view of this and because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when CLARIS™ CLARIFYING WASH is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children under the age of 12 have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Although rare, sodium sulfacetamide may cause local irritation.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTERATION</h2><p class="First">Wash affected areas once or twice daily, or as directed by your physician. Avoid contact with eyes or mucous membranes. Wet skin and liberally apply to areas to be treated, massage gently into skin for 10-20 seconds working into a full lather, rinse thoroughly and pat dry. If dying occurs, it may be controlled by rinsing wash off sooner or using less often.</p><h2>How is Claris Clarifying Wash Supplied</h2><p class="First">CLARIS™ CLARIFYING WASH is available in 16 fl. oz.
