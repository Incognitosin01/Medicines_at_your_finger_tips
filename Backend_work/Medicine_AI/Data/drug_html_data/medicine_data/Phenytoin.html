Phenytoin works by slowing down impulses in the brain that cause seizures.</p><p>Phenytoin is used to control seizures. It does not treat all types of seizures, and your doctor will determine if it is the right medicine for you.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use phenytoin if you also take delavirdine (Rescriptor), or if you are allergic to ethotoin (Peganone), fosphenytoin (Cerebyx), or mephenytoin (Mesantoin). If you are pregnant, DO NOT START TAKING this medicine unless your doctor tells you to. Phenytoin may cause harm to an unborn baby, but having a seizure during pregnancy could harm both the mother and the baby. If you become pregnant while taking this medicine, DO NOT STOP TAKING the medicine without your doctor's advice. Seizure control is very important during pregnancy and the benefits of preventing seizures may outweigh any risks posed by using phenytoin.</p><p>Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor, such as: mood or behavior changes, depression, anxiety, or if you feel agitated, hostile, restless, hyperactive (mentally or physically), or have thoughts about suicide or hurting yourself.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use phenytoin if you are allergic to it, or if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>liver problems caused by phenytoin;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an allergy to similar medicines such as ethotoin, fosphenytoin, or mephenytoin; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you currently take delavirdine (Rescriptor).</p>

</ul><p>liver problems caused by phenytoin;</p><p>an allergy to similar medicines such as ethotoin, fosphenytoin, or mephenytoin; or</p><p>if you currently take delavirdine (Rescriptor).</p><p>To make sure phenytoin is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>heart problems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>liver disease;</p>
</li>
<li>

Your doctor will need to check your progress at regular visits. Your family or other caregivers should also be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms.</p><p>Seizure control is very important during pregnancy. <b>Do not start or stop taking phenytoin without your doctor's advice if you are pregnant.</b> Phenytoin may harm an unborn baby, but having a seizure during pregnancy could harm both mother and baby. <b>Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant while taking this medicine.</b></p><p>If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry to track the effects of phenytoin on the baby.</p><p>If you have taken this medicine during pregnancy, be sure to tell the doctor who delivers your baby about your phenytoin use. Both you and the baby may need to receive medications to prevent excessive bleeding during delivery and just after birth.</p><p>Phenytoin can make birth control pills less effective. Ask your doctor about using a non-hormonal birth control (condom, diaphragm with spermicide) to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>It may not be safe to breast-feed while using this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2>How should I take phenytoin?</h2><p>Take phenytoin exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose.</p><p>Swallow an <b>extended-release capsule</b> whole and do not crush, chew, break, or open it.</p><p>Phenytoin chewable tablets are not for once-per-day dosing. You must take them 2 or 3 times per day. Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully.</p><p>Shake the <b>oral suspension</b> (liquid) before you measure a dose. Use the dosing syringe provided, or use a medicine dose-measuring device (not a kitchen spoon).</p><p>You may need frequent blood tests. You may also need a blood test when switching from one form to another. Visit your doctor regularly.</p><p>Tell your doctor if phenytoin does not seem to work as well in controlling your seizures. Do not stop using this medicine suddenly, even if you feel fine. Stopping suddenly may cause increased seizures. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.</p><p>In case of emergency, wear or carry medical identification to let others know you have seizures.</p><p>Phenytoin can cause swelling in your gums. Brush and floss your teeth and visit your dentist regularly to help prevent this problem.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, light, and heat.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Seizures:</b></p><p>Oral (except suspension) Loading dose: Only when indicated for inpatients.<br/>
