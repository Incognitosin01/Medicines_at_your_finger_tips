A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>Not every brand of  Kenalog-40 is used for the same conditions or injected into the same body areas. Some brands are given only one time as needed. Others may be given at regular intervals. Carefully follow your doctor's dosing instructions.</p><p>Kenalog-40 can weaken (suppress) your immune system, and you may get an infection more easily. Call your doctor if you have unusual bruising or bleeding, or signs of infection (fever, weakness, cold or flu symptoms, skin sores, diarrhea, frequent or recurring illness).</p><p>Long-term use of steroids can cause harmful effects on the eyes. If you receive Kenalog-40 for longer than 6 weeks, your doctor may want you to have regular eye exams.</p><p>Your doctor may instruct you to limit your salt intake while you are receiving Kenalog-40. You may also need to take potassium supplements. Follow all instructions.</p><p>This medicine can affect the results of certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using Kenalog-40.</p><p><b>You should not stop using Kenalog-40 suddenly after long-term repeated use</b>, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss an appointment for a scheduled  Kenalog-40.</p><p>When Kenalog-40 is used as a single dose, you will not be on a regular dosing schedule.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since  Kenalog-40 is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><p>Using too much Kenalog-40 is not likely to cause serious problems. However, long term use of high doses can lead to thinning skin, easy bruising, changes in body fat (especially in your face, neck, back, and waist), increased acne or facial hair, menstrual problems, impotence, or loss of interest in sex.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while receiving  Kenalog-40?</h2><p>After injection of triamcinolone into a joint, avoid overusing that joint through strenuous activity or high-impact sports. You could cause damage to the joint.</p><p>Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Call your doctor for preventive treatment if you are exposed to chickenpox or measles. These conditions can be serious or even fatal in people who are using Kenalog-40.</p><p>Do not receive a "live" vaccine or a toxoid vaccine while using Kenalog-40, or you could develop a serious infection. Live vaccines include measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), polio, rotavirus, typhoid, yellow fever, varicella (chickenpox), zoster (shingles), and nasal flu (influenza) vaccine. Toxoid vaccines include diphtheria-tetanus toxoid (DT or Td).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Kenalog-40 side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction</b>: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
