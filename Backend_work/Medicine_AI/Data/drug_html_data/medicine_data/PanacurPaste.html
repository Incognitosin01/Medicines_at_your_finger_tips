The chemical name of fenbendazole is methyl 5-(phenylthio)-2-benzimidazole carbamate.</p><p>The chemical structure is:</p><p>Each gram of Panacur<span class="Sup">®</span> (fenbendazole) Paste 10% contains 100 mg of fenbendazole and is flavored with artificial apple-cinnamon liquid.</p><h2>ACTIONS</h2><p class="First">The antiparasitic action of Panacur<span class="Sup">®</span> (fenbendazole) Paste 10% is believed to be due to the inhibition of energy metabolism in the parasite.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Panacur<span class="Sup">®</span> (fenbendazole) Paste 10% is indicated for the control of large strongyles <span class="Italics">(Strongylus edentatus, S. equinus, S. vulgaris)</span>, encysted early third stage (hypobiotic), late third stage and fourth stage cyathostome larvae, small strongyles, pinworms <span class="Italics">(Oxyuris equi)</span>, ascarids <span class="Italics">(Parascaris equorum)</span>, and arteritis caused by fourth stage larvae of <span class="Italics">Strongylus vulgaris</span> in horses.</p><p>Panacur<span class="Sup">®</span> (fenbendazole) Paste 10% is approved for use concomitantly with an approved form of trichlorfon. Trichlorfon is approved for the treatment of stomach bots <span class="Italics">(Gasterophilus</span> spp<span class="Italics">.)</span> in horses. Refer to the manufacturer's label for directions for use and cautions for trichlorfon.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Side effects associated with Panacur<span class="Sup">®</span> (fenbendazole) Paste 10% could not be established in well-controlled safety studies in horses with single doses as high as 454 mg/lb (1,000 mg/kg) and 15 consecutive daily doses of 22.7 mg/lb (50 mg/kg). Particularly with higher doses, the lethal action of fenbendazole may cause the release of antigens by the dying parasites. This phenomenon may result in either a local or systemic hypersensitive reaction. As with any drug, these reactions should be treated symptomatically.</p><p>Panacur<span class="Sup">®</span> (fenbendazole) Paste 10% has been evaluated for safety in pregnant mares during all stages of gestation with doses as high as 11.4 mg/lb (25 mg/kg) and in stallions with doses as high as 11.4 mg/lb (25 mg/kg). No adverse effects on reproductivity were detected. The recommended dose for control of 4th stage larvae of <span class="Italics">Strongylus vulgaris</span>, 4.6 mg/lb (10 mg/kg) daily for 5 consecutive days, has not been evaluated for safety in stallions or pregnant mares.</p><h3>Internal Parasites</h3><p class="First">Regular deworming at intervals of six to eight weeks may be required due to the possibility of reinfection.</p><h3>Migrating Tissue Parasites</h3><p class="First">In the case of 4th stage larvae of <span class="Italics">Strongylus vulgaris</span>, treatment and retreatment should be based on the life cycle and the epidemiology. Treatment should be initiated in the spring and repeated in the fall after a six month interval.</p><h3>Optimum Deworming Program for control of S. vulgaris</h3><p class="First">Optimum reduction of <span class="Italics">S. vulgaris</span> infections is achieved by reducing the infectivity of the pastures. When horses are running on pasture, in temperate North America, maximum pasture infectivity occurs in October-December. If horses are removed from those pastures in January, pasture infectivity will decline to zero by July 1. Egg production of <span class="Italics">S. vulgaris</span> is minimal from January through April, peaking in August and declining to minimal values in December.</p><h3>Recommended Deworming Program</h3><p class="First">**December 1, February 1, <span class="Bold">April 1</span>, June 1, August 1, <span class="Bold">October 1</span>.</p><p>The two treatments that are in bold type are the recommended periods when the 5 day treatment regimen for the control of the migrating larvae of <span class="Italics">S. vulgaris</span> should be performed.</p><p>**For other areas in the world, retreatment periods for the migrating larvae of <span class="Italics">S. vulgaris</span> may be different; consult with your veterinarian.</p><h2>CAUTIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Keep this and all medication out of the reach of children.</span></p><p>When using Panacur<span class="Sup">®</span> (fenbendazole) Paste 10% concomitantly with trichlorfon, refer to the manufacturer's labels for use and cautions for trichlorfon.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Do not use in horses intended for human consumption</span></p><h2>DOSAGE</h2><p class="First">Panacur<span class="Sup">®</span> (fenbendazole) Paste 10% is administered orally at a rate of 2.3 mg/lb (5 mg/kg) for the control of large strongyles, small strongyles, and pinworms. One syringe will deworm a 1,100 lb horse. For foals and weanlings (less than 18 months of age) where ascarids are a common problem, the recommended dose is 4.6 mg/lb (10 mg/kg); one syringe will deworm a 550 lb horse.</p><p>For control of encysted early third stage (hypobiotic), late third stage and fourth stage cyathostome larvae, and fourth stage larvae of <span class="Italics">Strongylus vulgaris,</span> the recommended dose is 4.6 mg/lb (10 mg/kg) daily for 5 consecutive days; administer one syringe for each 550 Ibs body weight per day.</p><p><span class="Bold">SEE PRECAUTIONS FOR RETREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS.</span></p><h2>DIRECTIONS FOR USE</h2><h2>How is Panacur Paste Supplied</h2><p class="First">Panacur<span class="Sup">®</span> (fenbendazole) Paste 10% Equine Dewormer is supplied in 25 g syringes.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Store at or below 25°C (77°F).</span></p><p class="First">CONSULT YOUR VETERINARIAN FOR ASSISTANCE IN THE DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND CONTROL OF PARASITISM.</p><p class="First">Made in France</p><p>Distributed by:<br/>
