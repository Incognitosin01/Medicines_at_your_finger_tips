These symptoms may include a feeling of heat, sweating, and warmth in the face, neck, or chest ("hot flashes"); and dryness, burning, and itching in the vagina.</p><p>Esterified estrogens are a man-made mixture of estrogens. Estrogen is a hormone that is produced by the body in greater amounts in females. It is necessary for normal sexual development of the female and for regulation of the menstrual cycle during the childbearing years. Methyltestosterone is a man-made form of testosterone, a hormone that is produced by the body in greater amounts in males and small amounts in females. Menopause symptoms occur when the hormone balance changes in the female body. This combination of hormones will relieve the symptoms of menopause by adding more hormones to the body.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Syntest H.S.</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
