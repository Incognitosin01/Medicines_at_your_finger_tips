Avoid in pregnancy and in patients with hepatic disease.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Lactation</h3><p>Avoid use. Preparations may contain hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids with carcinogenic and mutagenic potential.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>None well documented. Caution is warranted if used concurrently with anticoagulants (eg, warfarin) or antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel).</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>Clinical trials are lacking. Allergic and hypertensive effects are possible.</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>Carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and phototoxicity have been described for various chemical constituents.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Asteraceae (daisies)</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>Coltsfoot is an invasive, perennial plant growing up to 30 cm tall. Golden flowers that look similar to dandelions appear and die before leaves are produced, hence the name <i>Filius ante patrem</i> (the son before the father). The seeds of the plant are soft, hair-like tufts often used by birds to build nests, and the leaves are broad and hoof-shaped, with hairs on upper and lower surfaces. The leaves and flowering buds are of primary medicinal interest. Although related to Petasites (butterbur), activities of coltsfoot should be regarded separately.USDA.2014, Duke.2002, Shikov 2014 Although sometimes considered synonymous with Petasites Mill., butterbur and coltsfoot are monographed separately (see Butterbur monograph).</p><h2>History</h2><p>Coltsfoot has been widely used for multiple indications, including the treatment of bronchitis, lung cancer, emphysema, inflammation, rheumatism, swelling and water retention, and tuberculosis. It is listed in the Chinese and Russian pharmacopoeias as having been used for centuries for coughs.Duke 2002, Kim 2013, Shikov 2014</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Pyrrolizidine alkaloids, especially senkirkine, are present; however, the total alkaloid content is lower than in butterbur.Duke 2002, Shikov 2014</p><p>Sequiterpenes, including tussilagone, bisabolene, triterpenes, flavonoids, and pyrrolizidine alkaloids, are well described.Li 2012, Liu 2011, Liu 2008, Park 2008 An overview of the chemical constituents in the flowers, leaves, and whole plant is available.Duke 2014</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Cardiovascular effects</h3><p>In dogs, cats, and rats, an alcoholic extract produced a pressor effect similar to that of dopamine, but without tachyphylaxis. Increased heart rate was observed.Shikov 2014, Li 1988</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of coltsfoot in cardiovascular conditions.</p><h3>Respiratory effects</h3><p>Antitussive and expectorant effects of coltsfoot flowers have been investigated in mice.Li 2012, Li 2013</p><p>Despite traditional use for coughs, research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of coltsfoot in respiratory conditions.</p><h3>Other uses</h3><p>Antimicrobial effects have been shown against Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Staphylococcus aureus.Kokoska 2002, Zhao 2014</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated antioxidant effects for coltsfoot; clinical applications are lacking, but may relate to anti-inflammatory and chemo- and neuroprotective effects.Cho 2005, Kim 2006, Li 2012, Lim 2008</p><p>Further in vitro studies suggest extracts of coltsfoot may have applications in diabetes and cancer.Li 2014, Park 2008</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Clinical trials are lacking to provide dosage recommendations.</p><p>Traditional dosage: 2 to 4 mL liquid leaf extract or 0.6 to 2 mL liquid flower extract.Duke 2002</p><p>No more than 4.5 to 6 g/day for no longer than 4 to 6 weeks per year in total, due to pyrrolizidine alkaloid content.Duke 2002, Blumenthal 2000</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use. Preparations may contain hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids with carcinogenic and mutagenic potential.Blumenthal 2000, Duke 2002, Ernst 2002</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.Chen 2012, Ulbricht 2008 High doses of coltsfoot may interact with cardiovascular medicines.Duke 2002 The constituent tussilagone demonstrates weak antiplatelet and calcium channel blocking activity.Hwang 1987, Liu 2008 Caution is warranted if coltsfoot is used concurrently with anticoagulants (eg, warfarin) or antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Animal studies reported allergenic potential.Duke 2002 A warning label regarding the presence of potentially hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids has been recommended for all coltsfoot preparations.Kim 2013, Dangerous supplements 2010</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are liver toxins with carcinogenic and mutagenic potential.Blumenthal 2000, Shikov 2014 Phototoxicity has been reported in guinea pig skin.Duke 2002 Development of hepatic tumors in rats has been reported.Duke 2002, Hirono 1976 Case reports exist of both fatal (in a newborn) and reversible (in an 18-month-old) hepatic vaso-occlusive disease; causality was suspected but not established.Shikov 2014, Sperl 1995 Coltsfoot was implicated in another case report of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in an adult consuming a combination of herbal preparations.Freshour 2012</p><h2>Index Terms</h2><ul><li><i>Petasites</i></li></ul><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
