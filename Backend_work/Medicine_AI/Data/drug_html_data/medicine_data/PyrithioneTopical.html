This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For pyrithione, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to pyrithione or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Although there is no specific information comparing use of pyrithione in children with use in other age groups, pyrithione is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of pyrithione in the elderly with use in other age groups, pyrithione is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of pyrithione</h2><p>For best results, use pyrithione at least 2 times a week or as directed by your doctor.</p><p>To use:</p><ul>
<li>Before applying this shampoo, wet the hair and scalp with lukewarm water.</li>
<li>Apply enough shampoo to the scalp to work up a lather and rub in well, then rinse.</li>
<li>Apply the shampoo again and rinse thoroughly.</li>
</ul><p>Keep pyrithione away from the eyes. If you should accidentally get some in your eyes, flush them thoroughly with water.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of pyrithione will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of pyrithione. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
