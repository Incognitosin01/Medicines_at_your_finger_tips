The anemia associated with ribavirin therapy may result in worsening of cardiac disease that has led to fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions. Patients with a history of significant or unstable cardiac disease should not be treated with ribavirin</p><p>Significant teratogenic and embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin. In addition, ribavirin has a multiple dose half-life of 12 days, and may persist in non-plasma compartments for as long as 6 months. Therefore, ribavirin therapy is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in the male partners of women who are pregnant. Avoid pregnancy during therapy and for 6 months after completion of treatment in both female patients and female partners of male patients who are taking ribavirin therapy. Effective contraception must be utilized during treatment and during the 6-month post-treatment follow-up period.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Hemolytic anemia: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Hemolytic anemia has been reported with ribavirin therapy; anemia associated with ribavirin may worsen underlying cardiac disease and lead to fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions. Avoid use in patients with significant/unstable cardiac disease.</b> Anemia usually occurs within 1 to 2 weeks of therapy initiation; observed in ~10% to 13% of patients when alfa interferons were combined with ribavirin. Assess cardiac function before initiation of therapy. If patient has underlying cardiac disease, assess electrocardiogram prior to and periodically during treatment. If any deterioration in cardiovascular status occurs, discontinue therapy. Use caution in patients with baseline risk of severe anemia. Assess hemoglobin and hematocrit at baseline and, at minimum, weeks 2 and 4 of therapy since initial drop may be significant. Patients with renal dysfunction and/or those &gt;50 years of age should be carefully assessed for development of anemia.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Risk of hepatic decompensation in chronic hepatitis C patients treated with combination therapy; monitor hepatic function closely and discontinue therapy immediately if evidence of hepatic decompensation is observed.</p><p>• Hepatitis C: Appropriate use: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Ribavirin monotherapy is not effective for chronic hepatitis C infection and should not be used alone for hepatitis C.</b></p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; dosage adjustment or discontinuation may be required.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p><i>Combination therapy with alfa interferons: </i></p><p>• Autoimmune/infectious disorders: Have occurred with combination therapy; use with caution in patients with autoimmune disease or severe infection.</p><p>• Bone marrow suppression: Pancytopenia has occurred with combination therapy and concomitant use of azathioprine; onset occurs within 3 to 7 weeks; discontinue combination therapy and azathioprine if pancytopenia occurs; may be reversible (usually within 4 to 6 weeks).</p><p>• Dental and periodontal disorders: Have been reported with combination therapy; patients should be instructed to brush teeth twice daily and have regular dental exams. Xerostomia may contribute to and/or exacerbate dental disorders.</p><p>• Dermatologic reactions: Severe cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and exfoliative dermatitis have been reported (rarely) with combination therapy; discontinue immediately with signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions.</p><p>• Diabetes: Has occurred with combination therapy; monitor blood sugars closely.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Acute hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, and urticaria) have been observed with combination therapy; discontinue immediately with signs or symptoms of severe hypersensitivity reactions.</p><p>• Ophthalmologic disorders: Serious disorders (eg, retinopathy, macular edema, retinal artery/vein thrombosis, optic neuritis, retinal detachment) have occurred with combination therapy. All patients require an eye exam at baseline; those with preexisting ophthalmologic disorders (eg, diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy) require periodic follow up. Discontinue therapy in patients with new or worsening ophthalmologic disorders.</p><p>• Pancreatitis: Has occurred with combination therapy; interrupt therapy if pancreatitis is suspected and discontinue if confirmed.</p><p>• Psychiatric disorders: Severe psychiatric events have occurred including depression and suicidal/homicidal ideation during combination therapy. Suicidal ideation or attempts occurred more often in pediatric patients versus reports in adults during treatment and off-therapy follow-up (2.4% vs 1%). Avoid use in patients with a psychiatric history; discontinue if severe psychiatric symptoms occur.</p><p>• Pulmonary events: Pulmonary symptoms (eg, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, and pneumonia [rarely fatal]) have been associated with combination therapy; use with caution in patients with pulmonary disease, including sarcoidosis (exacerbation reported).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Elderly: Use with caution in the elderly; may be more susceptible to adverse effects such as anemia. Monitor renal function closely.</p><p>• Pediatric: In combination therapy with alfa interferons, ribavirin may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric and adolescent patients 5 to 17 years of age for the length of treatment. Delay in weight and height increases have been noted in pediatric patients treated with combination therapy. In clinical studies, decreases were noted in weight and height for age z-scores and normative growth curve percentiles. Following treatment, rebound growth and weight gain occurred in most patients; however, a small percentage did not. Long-term data indicate that combination therapy may inhibit growth resulting in reduced adult height in some patients. Growth should be closely monitored in pediatric patients during therapy and post-treatment for growth catch-up.</p><p>• Pregnancy: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Use is contraindicated in pregnant females or male partners of pregnant females. Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been observed in all animal studies. Avoid pregnancy in female patients and female partners of male patients during therapy; use effective contraceptive measures during treatment and for at least 6 months after completion of therapy.</b></p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity ("gasping syndrome") in neonates; the "gasping syndrome" consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggest that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol derivative with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Safety and efficacy have not been established in patients who have failed previous interferon therapy, received organ transplants, or been coinfected with hepatitis B or HIV (ribavirin tablets may be used in adult HIV-coinfected patients with clinically stable disease and CD4+ cell count &gt;100 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>). The combination of peginterferon and ribavirin, even with additional preferred HCV antiviral agent(s), is <b>not </b>recommended for hepatitis C virus (HCV) (regardless of genotype) in HCV adult treatment guidelines (treatment-naive or treatment-experienced); consult current clinical practice guidelines for details on appropriate use (AASLD/IDSA 2018).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p><b>Manufacturer’s labeling:</b></p><p>Pretreatment hematological and biochemical tests are recommended for all patients; dental exam, ECG (if preexisting cardiac abnormalities or disease) and ophthalmic exam (also periodically during treatment for those with preexisting ophthalmologic disorders) are also recommended.
