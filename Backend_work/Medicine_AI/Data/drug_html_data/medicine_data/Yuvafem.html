In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.3,</span><span class="Italics">5.15)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p>Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.</p><h3>2.1 Treatment of Atrophic Vaginitis due to Menopause</h3><p class="First">Yuvafem should be administered intravaginally using the supplied applicator: 1 insert daily for 2 weeks, followed by 1 insert twice weekly (for example, Tuesday and Friday). Generally, women should be started at the 10 mcg dosage strength.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Yuvafem are small, white, round, film-coated, bi-convex vaginal inserts containing 10 mcg of estradiol. Each vaginal insert is 6 mm in diameter and is administered in a disposable applicator.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Yuvafem should not be used in women with any of the following conditions:</p><ul>
<li>Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding</li>
<li>Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer</li>
<li>Known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia</li>
<li>Active DVT, PE, or history of these conditions</li>

</ul><h2>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>5.1 Risks from Systemic Absorption</h3><p class="First">Yuvafem are intended only for vaginal administration. Systemic absorption occurs with the use of Yuvafem. The warnings, precautions and adverse reactions associated with the use of systemic estrogen-alone therapy should be taken into account.</p><h3>5.2 Cardiovascular Disorders</h3><p class="First">An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen-alone therapy. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogen with or without progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately.</p><p><span class="Italics">Stroke</span></p><p>In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.2)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years). <span class="Sup">1</span></p><p>In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years) <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.2)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.

During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of the original HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall.</p><p><span class="Italics">Venous Thromboembolism</span></p><p>In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE) was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years <span class="Sup">3</span><span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.2)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted <span class="Sup">4</span><span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.2)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.</p><h3>5.3 Malignant Neoplasms</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Endometrial Cancer</span></p><p>An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with an increased risk of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.</p><p>Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.</p><p>There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.</p><p><span class="Italics">Breast Cancer</span></p><p>The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer <span class="Italics">[relative risk (RR) 0.80]</span><span class="Sup">5</span><span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.2)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p>The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups <span class="Sup">6</span><span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.2)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p>Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.</p><p>The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin therapy has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.</p><p>All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.</p><p><span class="Italics">Ovarian Cancer</span></p><p>The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. <span class="Sup">7</span> In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies, and some report no association.</p><h3>5.4 Probable Dementia</h3><p class="First">In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo.</p><p>After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83 to 2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years <span class="Sup">8</span><span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.3)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p>In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years <span class="Sup">8</span><span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.3)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p>When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19 to 2.60). Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women <span class="Sup">8</span><span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.3)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>5.5 Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported.</p><h3>5.6 Hypercalcemia</h3><p class="First">Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in women with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level.</p><h3>5.7 Visual Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in women receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued.</p><h3>5.8 Addition of a Progestin When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy</h3><p class="First">Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.</p><p>There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer.</p><h3>5.9 Elevated Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen.</p><h3>5.10 Hypertriglyceridemia</h3><p class="First">In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs.</p><h3>5.11 Hepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice</h3><p class="First">Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.</p><h3>5.12 Hypothyroidism</h3><p class="First">Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T <span class="Sub">4</span> and T <span class="Sub">3</span> serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.</p><h3>5.13 Fluid Retention</h3><p class="First">Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogen-alone is prescribed.</p><h3>5.14 Hypocalcemia</h3><p class="First">Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.</p><h3>5.15 Exacerbation of Endometriosis</h3><p class="First">A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy. For women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered.</p><h3>5.16 Hereditary Angioedema</h3><p class="First">Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema.</p><h3>5.17 Exacerbation of Other Conditions</h3><p class="First">Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.</p><h3>5.18 Local Abrasion</h3><p class="First">A few cases of local abrasion induced by the Yuvafem applicator have been reported, especially in women with severely atrophic vaginal mucosa.</p><h3>5.19 Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy.</p><h3>5.20 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, IIVII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity.</p><p>Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T <span class="Sub">4</span> levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T <span class="Sub">3</span> levels by radioimmunoassay. T <span class="Sub">3</span> resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T <span class="Sub">4</span> and free T <span class="Sub">3</span> concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone.</p><p>Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin).</p><p>Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations, increased triglyceride levels.</p><p>Impaired glucose tolerance.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul>

Inducers of CYP3A4, such as St. John’s wort ( <span class="Italics">Hypericum perforatum</span>) preparations, phenobarbital, carbamazepine and rifampin, may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in side effects.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>8.1 Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Yuvafem should not be used during pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.

Each Yuvafem, 10 mcg contains the following excipients: corn starch, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate. The film coating contains hypromellose and polyethylene glycol. Each Yuvafem vaginal insert is 6 mm in diameter and is placed in a disposable applicator. Each insert-filled applicator is packaged separately in a blister pack. Yuvafem are used intravaginally. When the insert comes in contact with the vaginal mucosa, estradiol, USP is released into the vagina.</p><p>USP Dissolution Test is pending.</p><p>Estradiol hemihydrate is a white, almost white or colorless crystalline solid, chemically described as estra-1,3,5 (10)-triene-3,17β-diol.

Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.</p><p>The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.</p><p>Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.</p><p>Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.</p><h3>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Currently, there are no pharmacodynamic data known for Yuvafem.</p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>Estrogen drug products are well absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes and the gastrointestinal tract.

Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the gut followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant portion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Estradiol, estrone and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.</p><p><span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations</span></p><p>No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in specific populations, including patients with renal or hepatic impairment.</p><h2>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><h3>13.1 Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis and liver.</p><h2>CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><h3>14.1 Effects on Atrophic Vaginitis</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Yuvafem 10 mcg</span></p><p>A 12-month double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled multicenter study was conducted in the U.S. and Canada to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Yuvafem 10 mcg in the treatment of atrophic vaginitis in 309 postmenopausal women between 46 and 81 years of age (mean 57.6 years of age) who at baseline identified their most bothersome symptom of atrophic vaginitis from among six symptoms (vaginal dryness, vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching, vaginal soreness, dysuria, dyspareunia and vaginal bleeding associated with intercourse). Women inserted one insert intravaginally each day for 14 days, then one insert twice weekly for the remaining 50 weeks. The majority (92.9 percent) of the women were Caucasian (n=287), 3.2 percent were Black (n=10), 1.6 percent were Asian (n=5) and 2.2 percent were Other (n=7). All subjects were assessed for improvement in the mean change from baseline to Week 12 for co-primary efficacy variables of: a composite of most bothersome symptoms of atrophic vaginitis; percentage of vaginal superficial cells and percentage of vaginal parabasal cells on a vaginal smear; and vaginal pH.</p><p><span class="Italics">Relief of Vaginal Symptoms</span></p><p>Yuvafem 10 mcg was statistically superior to placebo in reducing the severity of a composite score of most bothersome symptoms associated with atrophic vaginitis at Week 12 (see Table 5).</p><p>Also demonstrated for Yuvafem 10 mcg compared to placebo was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of superficial cells at Week 12 (13.2 percent compared to 3.8 percent for matching placebo, p&lt;0.001), a statistically significant decrease in parabasal cells at Week 12 (-37 percent compared to -9.3 percent for matching placebo, p&lt;0.001), and a statistically significant mean reduction between baseline and Week 12 in vaginal pH score (-1.3 compared to -0.4 for matching placebo, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>Endometrial safety was assessed by endometrial biopsy at the screening and final study visit.
