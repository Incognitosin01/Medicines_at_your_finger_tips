These enzymes are normally produced by the pancreas and are important in the digestion of fats, proteins, and sugars.</p><p>Creon is used to replace these enzymes when the body does not have enough of its own. Certain medical conditions can cause this lack of enzymes, including cystic fibrosis, chronic inflammation of the pancreas, or blockage of the pancreatic ducts.</p><p>Creon may also be used following surgical removal of the pancreas.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Call your doctor at once if you have symptoms of a rare but serious bowel disorder:</b> severe or unusual stomach pain, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea, or constipation.</p><p>Do not chew or keep Creon in your mouth.
