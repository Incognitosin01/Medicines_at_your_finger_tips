Although there are more than 90 known pneumococcal capsular types, pneumococcal disease is mainly caused by only a few serotypes of pneumococci. Pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent contains capsular polysaccharides of 23 pneumococcal types of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> that represent at least 85% to 90% of pneumococcal disease isolates in the US. The 23 capsular pneumococcal vaccine contains purified capsular polysaccharides of pneumococcal types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19F, 19A, 20, 22F, 23F, and 33F.</p><p>Efficacy: In adults, PPSV23 demonstrated 50% to 80% efficacy in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease due to relevant serotypes of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> (CDC/ACIP 59[34] 2010).</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>Immunity develops within approximately 2 to 3 weeks after vaccination (Pink Book [Atkinson 2012])</p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>Protective antibody levels persist for at least 5 years.

Additional information is available from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Immunization Action Coalition.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Consult CDC/ACIP annual immunization schedules for additional information including specific detailed recommendations for catch-up scenarios and/or care of patients with high-risk conditions. According to ACIP, doses administered ≤4 days before minimum interval or age are considered valid; however, local or state mandates may supersede this timeframe (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b>Primary immunization:</b> Children ≥2 years and Adolescents with specified underlying medical conditions: IM, SubQ: 0.5 mL as a single dose; immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) should be completed prior to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) as recommended. The minimum interval between PCV13 and PPSV23 is 8 weeks (AAP 2010; ACIP [Kobayashi 2015]; CDC/ACIP [Nuorti 2010]).</p><p><b>Revaccination: </b> Children ≥2 and Adolescents with functional or anatomic asplenia, those who are immunocompromised, and others with high-risk medical conditions [see guidelines for specific details]: One revaccination dose ≥5 years after the first dose of PPSV23.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IM, SubQ: Administer SubQ or IM (deltoid muscle or lateral midthigh). Do not inject IV; avoid intradermal administration (may cause severe local reactions). Do not mix with other vaccines or injections; separate needles and syringes should be used for each injection. To prevent syncope related injuries, patients should be vaccinated while seated or lying down (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If purchased under CDC contract, US law requires that the date of administration, the vaccine manufacturer, lot number of vaccine, Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) edition date and date it was provided, and the administering person's name, title, and address be recorded.</p><p>For patients at risk of hemorrhage following intramuscular injection, the vaccine should be administered intramuscularly if, in the opinion of the physician familiar with the patient's bleeding risk, the vaccine can be administered by this route with reasonable safety. If the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, intramuscular vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered. A fine needle (23 gauge or smaller) can be used for the vaccination and firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. The patient should be instructed concerning the risk of hematoma from the injection. Patients on anticoagulant therapy should be considered to have the same bleeding risks and treated as those with clotting factor disorders (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Fingolimod: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated).

Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever); vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia); bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; if the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM injection can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with severely compromised cardiovascular function where a systemic reaction may pose a significant risk.</p><p>• HIV: Patients with HIV should be vaccinated as soon as possible following confirmation of the diagnosis (CDC/ACIP 61[40] 2012).</p><p>• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks: Vaccination may not be as effective in patients with chronic CSF leaks due to congenital lesions, skull fractures, or neurosurgical procedures.</p><p>• Pneumococcal meningitis: Pneumococcal vaccine may not be effective in preventing pneumococcal meningitis in persons who have chronic cerebrospinal fluid leakage resulting from congenital lesions, skull fractures, or neurosurgical procedures.</p><p>• Respiratory disease: Use with caution in patients with severe pulmonary disease where a systemic reaction may pose a significant risk.</p><p>• Splenectomy: Patients who will undergo splenectomy should also be vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to surgery, if possible (IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p>• Thrombocytopenia purpura: May cause relapse in patients with stable idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Anticoagulant therapy: Use with caution in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy; bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If a person has not received any pneumococcal vaccine or if pneumococcal vaccination status is unknown, PPSV23 should be administered as indicated.</p><p>• Antibiotic prophylaxis: This vaccine does not replace the need for penicillin (or other antibiotic) prophylaxis against pneumococcal infection. In persons who require penicillin (or other antibiotic) prophylaxis against pneumococcal infection, such prophylaxis should not be discontinued after vaccination with pneumococcal vaccine.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Consider deferring immunization during periods of severe immunosuppression (eg, patients receiving chemo/radiation therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy [including high-dose corticosteroids]); may have a reduced response to vaccination. In general, household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive all age appropriate vaccines. Inactivated vaccines should be administered ≥2 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression when feasible; inactivated vaccines administered during chemotherapy should be readministered after immune competence is regained (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; (IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p>• Children: Pneumococcal vaccine is not approved for use in children &lt;2 years. Children in this age group do not develop an effective immune response to the capsular types contained in this polysaccharide vaccine.</p><p>• Cochlear implants: Patients who will undergo cochlear implant placement should be vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to surgery, if possible (IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p>• Elderly: Postmarketing reports of adverse effects in elderly patients, especially those with comorbidities, have been significant enough to require hospitalization.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Use of this vaccine for specific medical and/or other indications (eg, immunocompromising conditions, hepatic or kidney disease, diabetes) is also addressed in the annual ACIP Recommended Immunization Schedules (refer to CDC schedule for detailed information). Specific recommendations for use of this vaccine in immunocompromised patients with asplenia, cancer, HIV infection, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, cochlear implants, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (prior to or after), sickle cell disease, solid organ transplant (prior to or after), or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for chronic conditions are available from the IDSA (Rubin 2014). Vaccination does not replace the need for antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcal infection when otherwise required.</p><p>• Antipyretics: Antipyretics have not been shown to prevent febrile seizures; antipyretics may be used to treat fever or discomfort following vaccination (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). One study reported that routine prophylactic administration of acetaminophen prior to vaccination to prevent fever decreased the immune response of some vaccines; the clinical significance of this reduction in immune response has not been established (Prymula 2009).</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor for anaphylaxis and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Vaccination should be considered in pregnant women at high risk for infection. Inactivated vaccines have not been shown to cause increased risks to the fetus (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to prevent pneumococcal disease.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
