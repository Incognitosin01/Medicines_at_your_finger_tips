The area usually becomes indurated and sloughing may occur. If leakage of drug is obvious, prompt infiltration of the area with sterile isotonic sodium thiosulfate (1/6 molar) and application of an ice compress for 6 to 12 hours may minimize the local reaction. For a 1/6 molar solution of sodium thiosulfate, use 4.14 g of sodium thiosulfate per 100 mL of sterile water for injection or 2.64 g of anhydrous sodium thiosulfate per 100 mL or dilute 4 mL of sodium thiosulfate injection (10%) with 6 mL of sterile water for injection.</p><p>Mechlorethamine is highly toxic, and both powder and solution must be handled and administered with care. Inhalation of dust or vapors and contact with skin or mucous membranes, especially those of the eyes, must be avoided. Due to the toxic properties of mechlorethamine (eg, corrosivity, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity), special handling procedures should be reviewed prior to handling and followed diligently.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Bone marrow suppression: Mechlorethamine may cause hematologic toxicity, including leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and lymphopenia. The onsets for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occur within 6 to 8 days and last for 10 to 21 days. Anemia typically has an onset within 2 weeks and is generally mild. The lymphocytopenia onset occurs within 1 day. Agranulocytopenia or hemolytic anemia may rarely occur. Severe hematologic toxicity may occur in patients with widespread disease, poor performance status, and/or those previously treated with other antineoplastic agents or radiation therapy. Bone marrow suppression may be prolonged (up to 50 days or longer); persistent pancytopenia has also been reported. Monitor blood counts. Bleeding due to severe thrombocytopenia may occur. Use with caution in patients with preexisting leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia or with tumor invasion of the bone marrow; treatment response (as defined by the absence of tumor in the bone marrow) may be associated with improvement of bone marrow function. However, in nonresponders or heavily pretreated patients, hematopoietic function may be further compromised, leading to more severe (and potentially fatal) leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Bone marrow function should recover after mechlorethamine administration prior to initiating radiation therapy or other chemotherapy regimens.</p><p>• Extravasation: Mechlorethamine is a vesicant. <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Extravasation results in painful inflammation with induration and sloughing. If extravasation occurs, promptly manage by infiltrating area with 1/6 molar sodium thiosulfate solution, followed by dry cold compresses for 6 to 12 hours to minimize the reaction.</b> For a 1/6 molar solution of sodium thiosulfate, use 4.14 g of sodium thiosulfate per 100 mL of sterile water for injection or 2.64 g of anhydrous sodium thiosulfate per 100 mL or dilute 4 mL of sodium thiosulfate injection (10%) with 6 mL of sterile water for injection. Ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during infusion. Avoid extravasation.</p><p>• Gastrointestinal toxicities: Mechlorethamine is associated with a high emetic potential (Dupuis 2011; Hesketh 2017; Roila 2016); antiemetics are recommended to prevent nausea and vomiting. Nausea may persist for up to 24 hours.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported.</p><p>• Immunosuppression: Mechlorethamine has immunosuppressant properties. May predispose patients to infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal).</p><p>• Secondary malignancies: Alkylating agents, including mechlorethamine, are associated with an increased incidence of secondary malignancies; concurrent radiation therapy or combination chemotherapy may increase the risk.</p><p>• Tumor lysis syndrome: Hyperuricemia may occur, especially with lymphomas; ensure adequate hydration; consider antihyperuricemic therapy if appropriate.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Amyloidosis: Nitrogen mustards may contribute to extensive/rapid development of amyloidosis. Mechlorethamine should only be used if foci of suppurative inflammation (acute and chronic) are absent.</p><p>• Nonresponding tumors: Bone and nervous system tumors typically respond poorly to mechlorethamine. The routine use of mechlorethamine in widely disseminated tumors is discouraged.</p><p><b><i>Special handling:</i></b></p><p>• Hazardous agent: <b> [US Boxed Warning]: Mechlorethamine is a highly toxic nitrogen mustard; avoid inhalation of vapors or dust; a<b>void dust or vapor contact with skin or eyes;<b> review and follow special handling procedures. </b></b></b>If accidental skin exposure occurs, wash/irrigate thoroughly with water for at least 15 minutes, followed by 2% sodium thiosulfate solution; remove and destroy any contaminated clothing. If exposure to eye(s) occurs, promptly irrigate for at least 15 minutes with copious amounts of water, normal saline, or balanced salt ophthalmic irrigating solution; obtain ophthalmology consultation. The manufacturer recommends neutralizing remaining unused mechlorethamine, empty or partial vials, gloves, tubing, glassware, etc., after mechlorethamine administration; soak in an aqueous solution containing equal volumes of sodium thiosulfate (5%) and sodium bicarbonate (5%) for 45 minutes; rinse with water; dispose of properly.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Experienced physician: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Should be administered under the supervision of an experienced cancer chemotherapy physician.</b></p><p>• Topical application: A gel formulation is commercially approved for topical treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides-type); refer to Mechlorethamine (Topical) monograph.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential and platelet count; renal and hepatic function. Monitor for signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and infection. Monitor infusion site for extravasation.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Females of reproductive potential are advised not to become pregnant during mechlorethamine treatment.</p><p>Delayed menses, oligomenorrhea, or temporary or permanent amenorrhea may be observed in female patients treated with mechlorethamine. Impaired spermatogenesis, azoospermia, and total germinal aplasia may occur in male patients treated with mechlorethamine, particularly when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
