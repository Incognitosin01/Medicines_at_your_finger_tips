Consult the <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section (2.1)</span> for instructions</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Tri-Estarylla™ Tablets are available in blister cards. Each blister pack contains</p><p>28 tablets in the following order:</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Do not prescribe norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol to women who are known to have the following conditions:</p><ul>
<li>Use of Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to the potential for ALT elevations [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (</span>5.3<span class="Bold">)]</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems</h3><h3>Liver Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Impaired Liver Function</span></span></p><p>Do not use norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].</span> Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if jaundice develops.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Liver Tumors</span></span></p><p>Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]</span>. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt;8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.</p><h3>5.3 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment</h3><p class="First">During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]</span>. Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.</p><h3>High Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].</span> For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if blood pressure rises significantly.</p><p>An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.</p><h3>Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis.</p><h3>Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</h3><p class="First">Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance.</p><p>Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.</p><p>Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.</p><h3>Headache</h3><p class="First">If a woman taking norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if indicated.</p><p>Consider discontinuation of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).</p><h3>Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting</span></span></p><p>Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product.</p><p>In clinical trials of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol, the frequency and duration of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,647 patients (21,275 evaluable cycles) and 4,826 patients (35,546 evaluable cycles), respectively. A total of 231 (4.8%) women discontinued norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 13 to 38% of women using norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced breakthrough/unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Amenorrhea and</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Oligomenorrhea</span></span></p><p>Women who use norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</p><p>If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.</p><h3>COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol use if pregnancy is confirmed.</p><p>Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see <span class="Bold">USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)</span>].</p><h3>Depression</h3><p class="First">Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if depression recurs to a serious degree.</p><h3>Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix</h3><p class="First">There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.</p><h3>Effect on Binding Globulins</h3><p class="First">The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.</p><h3>Monitoring</h3><p class="First">A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.</p><h3>Hereditary Angioedema</h3><p class="First">In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.</p><h3>Chloasma</h3><p class="First">Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The safety of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol was evaluated in 4,826 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 6 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 4 were uncontrolled open-label trials. In 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles; in 2 trials, subjects were followed for up to 12 cycles; and in 1 trial, subjects were followed for up to 6 cycles.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects):</span></span> The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 4,826 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (33.6%), breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge) (8%), vaginal infection (7.1%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (5.6%), mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression) (3.8%), genital discharge (3.2%), and changes in weight (including weight fluctuation, increased or decreased) (2.5%).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation:</span></span> Over the trials, between 9 to 27% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (4.3%), nausea/vomiting (2.8%), headache/migraine (2.4%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (1.1%), and weight increased (1.1%).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Serious Adverse Reactions:</span></span> breast cancer (1 subject), carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject), hypertension (1 subject), and migraine (2 subjects).</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Infections and Infestations</span>:</span> Urinary tract infection;</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Incl.

Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Colesevelam</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">:</span></span> Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs</span></span></p><p>Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors</span></span></p><p>Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]).</p><h3>Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs</h3><p class="First">Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs.</p><h3>Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.</p><h3>Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy – Liver Enzyme Elevation</h3><p class="First">Do not co-administer norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use COCs during early pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy.</p><p>Do not administer COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding as a test for pregnancy. Do not use COCs during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Advise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception, when possible, until she has weaned her child. COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well-established; however, it can occur at any time in some women. Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites are present in breast milk.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol have been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-pubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated.</p><p>There was no significant difference between Tri-Estarylla™ tablets and placebo in mean change in total lumbar spine (L1-L4) and total hip bone mineral density between baseline and Cycle 13 in 123 adolescent females with anorexia nervosa in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, one-year treatment duration clinical trial for the Intent To Treat (ITT) population.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol  has not been studied in postmenopausal women and are not indicated in this population.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol has not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment. However, steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic impairment. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. [See <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2).]</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol has not been studied in women with renal impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There have been no reports of serious ill effects from overdosage of oral contraceptives, including ingestion by children. Overdosage may cause withdrawal bleeding in females and nausea.</p><h2>Tri-Estarylla Description</h2><p class="First">Each of the following products is a combination oral contraceptive containing the progestational compound norgestimate and the estrogenic compound ethinyl estradiol. Norgestimate is designated as (18,19-Dinor-17-pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one,17-(acetyloxy)-13-ethyl-, oxime,(17α)-(+)-) and ethinyl estradiol is designated as (19-nor-17α-pregna,1,3,5(10)-trien-20-yne-3,17-diol).</p><h2>Tri-Estarylla - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">COCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation. Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation.</p><p class="First">Acne is a skin condition with a multifactorial etiology, including androgen stimulation of sebum production. While the combination of ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate increases sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and decreases free testosterone, the relationship between these changes and a decrease in the severity of facial acne in otherwise healthy women with this skin condition has not been established.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></span></p><p>Norgestimate (NGM) and EE are rapidly absorbed following oral administration. NGM is rapidly and completely metabolized by first pass (intestinal and/or hepatic) mechanisms to norelgestromin (NGMN) and norgestrel (NG), which are the major active metabolites of norgestimate.</p><p>Peak serum concentrations of NGMN and EE are generally reached by 2 hours after administration of norgestimate/ ethinyl estradiol. Accumulation following multiple dosing of the 250 mcg NGM / 35 mcg EE dose is approximately 2-fold for NGMN and EE compared with single dose administration.
