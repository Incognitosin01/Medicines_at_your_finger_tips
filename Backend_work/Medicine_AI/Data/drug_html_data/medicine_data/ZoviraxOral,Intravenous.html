Usually these medicines work for only one kind or group of virus infections.</p><p>Acyclovir is used to treat the symptoms of chickenpox, shingles, herpes virus infections of the genitals (sex organs), the skin, the brain, and mucous membranes (lips and mouth), and widespread herpes virus infections in newborns. Acyclovir is also used to prevent recurrent genital herpes infections. Although acyclovir will not cure herpes, it does help relieve the pain and discomfort and helps the sores (if any) heal faster.</p><p>Acyclovir may also be used for other virus infections as determined by your doctor. However, it does not work in treating certain virus infections, such as the common cold.</p><p>Acyclovir is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Zovirax</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Zovirax</h2><p>Patient information about the treatment of herpes, chickenpox, or shingles is available with this medicine. Read it carefully before using this medicine.</p><p><i>Acyclovir is best used as soon as possible after the symptoms of herpes infection or shingles</i> (for example, pain, burning, blisters) <i>begin to appear.</i></p><p>If you are taking acyclovir for the <i>treatment of chickenpox</i>, it is best to <i>start taking acyclovir as soon as possible after the first sign of the chickenpox rash</i>, usually within one day.</p><p>Acyclovir capsules, tablets, and oral suspension may be taken with meals or on an empty stomach.</p><p>Acyclovir is best taken with a full glass (8 ounces) of water.</p><p>If you are using <i>acyclovir oral suspension</i>, use a specially marked measuring spoon or other device to measure each dose accurately. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.</p><p>To help clear up your herpes infection, chickenpox, or shingles, <i>keep taking acyclovir for the full time of treatment</i>, even if your symptoms begin to clear up after a few days. <i>Do not miss any doses</i>. However, <i>do not use this medicine more often or for a longer time than your doctor ordered.</i></p><p>If you are taking acyclovir capsules, tablets, or oral suspension, you should drink plenty of water to avoid becoming dehydrated.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients.

Also, wear loose-fitting clothing to avoid irritating the sores (blisters).</p><p><i>It is important to remember that acyclovir will not keep you from spreading herpes to others.</i></p><p>Herpes infection of the genitals can be caught from or spread to your partner during any sexual activity. Even though you may get herpes if your partner has no symptoms, the infection is more likely to be spread if sores are present. This is true until the sores are completely healed and the scabs have fallen off. <i>Therefore, it is best to avoid any sexual activity if either you or your sexual partner has any symptoms of herpes.</i> The use of a latex condom (“rubber”') may help prevent the spread of herpes. However, spermicidal (sperm-killing) jelly or a diaphragm will probably not help.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Zovirax side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
