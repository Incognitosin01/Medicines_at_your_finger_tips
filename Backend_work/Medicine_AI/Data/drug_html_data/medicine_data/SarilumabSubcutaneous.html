Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Sarilumab injection will lower the number of some types of blood cells in your body. Because of this, you may bleed or get infections more easily. To help with these problems, avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers. Tell your doctor if you have any kind of infection before you start using sarilumab. Also tell your doctor if you have ever had an infection that would not go away or an infection that keeps coming back.</p><p>Call your doctor right away if you start to have a cough that will not go away, weight loss, night sweats, fever, chills, or flu-like symptoms, such as a runny or stuffy nose, headache, blurred vision, or feeling generally ill. These may be signs that you have an infection.</p><p>You will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start using sarilumab. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.</p><p>Sarilumab may cause serious stomach and bowel problems, especially if you have a history of ulcers or diverticulitis (inflammation of the intestines). Check with your doctor right away if you start having severe stomach cramps or pain, black, tarry stools, diarrhea, fever, or vomiting that is severe and sometimes bloody while being treated with sarilumab.</p><p>Sarilumab may increase the amount of cholesterol and fats in your blood. If this condition occurs, your doctor may give you some medicines that can lower the amount of cholesterol and fats in the blood.</p><p>Sarilumab injection may increase your risk of having certain cancers. Talk to your doctor if you have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, or unexplained weight loss. Also, check with your doctor right away if your skin has red, scaly patches, or raised bumps that are filled with pus.</p><p>Sarilumab may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. This can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after using sarilumab.</p><p>Do not have any live vaccines (immunizations) while you are being treated with sarilumab.
