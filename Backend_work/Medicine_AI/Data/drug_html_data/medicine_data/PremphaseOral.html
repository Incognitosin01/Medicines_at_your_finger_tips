Increased risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years) using estrogen alone have been reported. Increased risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli, and DVT in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years) using estrogen combined with progestin have been reported. An increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years or older has also been reported in women receiving estrogen alone or estrogen combined with progestin. Unopposed estrogens increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Adding a progestin will reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Diagnostic measures should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. Risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses, combinations, and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins. Estrogens, with or without progestins, should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration possible .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>
