The medicine enters the body through a catheter placed under your skin. You may be shown how to use injections at home. Do not self-inject Vivaglobin if you do not fully understand how to give the injection and properly dispose of used needles, tubing, and other items used to inject the medicine.</p><p>Vivaglobin is usually given once every week. Follow your doctor's dosing instructions. If you use this medication at home, keep a diary of the days and times you gave the injection and where you injected it on your body.</p><p>Vivaglobin must be given slowly, and the infusion can take about 1 hour to complete. You may need to use up to 4 catheters to inject this medicine into different body areas at the same time. Your care provider will show you the best places on your body to inject the medication. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Do not shake the medication bottle or you may ruin the medicine. Prepare your dose only when you are ready to give an injection. Do not mix Vivaglobin with other medications in the same infusion. Do not use if the medicine has changed colors or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p><b>Vivaglobin subcutaneous should not be injected into a vein.</b></p><p>Before injecting the medicine, test to make sure the infusion pump needle is not in a vein. To do this, gently pull back on the plunger of the syringe connected to the infusion tube. If blood flows back into the syringe, remove the catheter and tubing and throw them away. Start over with a new catheter and syringe, insert the needle in a new place on your body, and test for blood flow-back again.</p><p>Each single-use vial (bottle) of Vivaglobin is for one use only. Throw away after one use, even if there is still some medicine left in it after injecting your dose.</p><p>Use disposable injection items (needle, catheter, tubing) only once. Throw away the used items in a puncture-proof container (ask your pharmacist where you can get one and how to dispose of it). Keep this container out of the reach of children and pets.</p><p>While using Vivaglobin, you may need frequent blood tests.</p><p>This medication can cause unusual results with certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using Vivaglobin.</p><p>Keep Vivaglobin in its original carton to protect it from light. Store in the refrigerator at 2–8°C (36–46°F). Do not freeze. Throw away any immune globulin that has become frozen. Take the medicine out and allow it to reach room temperature before preparing your dose.</p><p>Throw away any unused Vivaglobin after the expiration date on the label has passed.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss a dose of this medicine.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid?</h2><p>Do not receive a "live" vaccine while using Vivaglobin.
