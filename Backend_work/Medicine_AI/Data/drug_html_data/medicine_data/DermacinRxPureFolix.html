Each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, stearic acid, magnesium stearate.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND DOSAGE</h2><p class="First">PureFolix is indicated for dietary management of patients with unique nutritional needs requiring increased folate levels and Vitamin D supplementation.</p><p><span class="Italics">PureFolix can be taken by women of childbearing age, pregnant women, and lactating and nonlactating mothers.</span></p><h2>DermacinRx PureFolix - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> synthesis of the major biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of ergocalciferol takes place in the liver (to 25-hydroxyvitamin D) and the second in the kidneys (to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D). Vitamin D metabolites promote the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus by the small intestine, thus elevating serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to permit bone mineralization. Vitamin D metabolites also mobilize calcium and phosphate from bone and probably increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate by the renal tubules.</p><p>There is a time lag of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of vitamin D and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active metabolites in the liver and kidneys. Parathyroid hormone is responsible for the regulation of this metabolism in the kidneys.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. PureFolix is contraindicated in patients with hypercalcemia, malabsorption syndrome, abnormal sensitivity to the toxic effects of vitamin D, and hypervitaminosis D.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><p class="First">KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have: kidney problems, thyroid disease. This medication should be used as directed during pregnancy or while breast-feeding. Consult your doctor about the risks and benefits.</p><p>Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B12 is deficient. Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations progress.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First">Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.</p><p>You should call your doctor for medical advice about serious adverse events. To report adverse side effects or to obtain product information, contact PureTek Corporation, at 1-877-921-7873.</p><h2>DermacinRx PureFolix Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Take one tablet daily or as directed by a healthcare practitioner.</p><h2>How is DermacinRx PureFolix Supplied</h2><p class="First">PureFolix Tablets are supplied as round, light yellow tablets printed with one side scored, the other side plain and dispensed in child-resistant bottles of 30 tablets (NDC 59088-090-54*).</p><p>* This product is a prescription-folate with or without other dietary ingredients that – due to increased folate levels (AUG 2 1973 FR 20750), requires an Rx on the label because of increased risk associated with masking of B12 deficiency (pernicious anemia).
