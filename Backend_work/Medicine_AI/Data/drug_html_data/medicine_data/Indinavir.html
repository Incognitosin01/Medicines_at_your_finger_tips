Take all of your HIV medicines as directed to control your infection.</p><p>If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry. This is to track the outcome of the pregnancy and to evaluate any effects of indinavir on the baby.</p><p>Women with HIV or AIDS should not breast feed a baby. Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk.</p><p>Indinavir is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old.</p><h2>How should I take indinavir?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label.
