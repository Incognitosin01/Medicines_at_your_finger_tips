</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for estradiol and dienogest</h2><p>Estradiol valerate and dienogest combination is used to prevent pregnancy. It is a birth control pill that contains two types of hormones, estrogens and progestins and, when taken properly, prevents pregnancy. It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization is prevented.</p><p>Estradiol valerate and dienogest combination is also used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding that is not caused by any diagnosed conditions of the uterus (womb) in women who choose to use birth control pills.</p><p>No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective. Discuss with your doctor your options for birth control.</p><p>Estradiol valerate and dienogest combination does not prevent AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.</p><p>Estradiol and dienogest is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using estradiol and dienogest</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For estradiol and dienogest, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to estradiol and dienogest or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of estradiol valerate and dienogest combination have not been performed in the pediatric population. However, pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of this medication in teenagers are not expected. Estradiol and dienogest may be used for birth control in teenage females but is not indicated before the start of menstruation.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of estradiol valerate and dienogest combination have not been performed in the geriatric population. Estradiol and dienogest is not indicated for use in elderly women.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking estradiol and dienogest, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using estradiol and dienogest with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
