This medicine is sometimes used together with another drug called ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).</p><p>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic liver disease that gradually destroys bile ducts in the liver. These ducts deliver bile to the small intestines, to help your body digest fats and nutrients. When PBC destroys these ducts, the bile stays in your liver and damages its cells. This can lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and liver failure. PBC is a progressive disease that may have no symptoms for many years. Treating PBC can help keep the liver functioning normally.</p><p>Ocaliva was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on an "accelerated" basis. In clinical studies, some people with PBC responded to this medicine, but further studies are needed.</p><p>It is not known if taking Ocaliva will improve your chance of survival or improve your symptoms of PBC.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>To determine a safe dose for you, your doctor will check your liver function. Take Ocaliva exactly as directed.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have signs of worsening liver problems, such as swelling around your midsection, changes in your mental status, yellowing of your skin or eyes, bloody or tarry stools, or coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Ocaliva if you are allergic to obeticholic acid, or if you have complete blockage of your bile ducts.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had liver disease. Your doctor will perform tests to make sure you do not have liver conditions that would prevent you from safely using Ocaliva.</p><p>It is not known whether obeticholic acid will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p>It may not be safe to breast-feed a baby while you are using this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risks.</p><h2>How should I take Ocaliva?</h2><p>Use Ocaliva exactly as it was prescribed for you. ollow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Before and during treatment with this medicine, your doctor will check your liver function. This will help determine a safe dose for you.</p><p>You may take Ocaliva with or without food.</p><p>Ocaliva can cause itching, and you may be given medicine to treat this side effect if it occurs. If itching is severe, your doctor may ask you to stop taking the medicine for a short time.</p><p>Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve, or if they get worse. The most common symptom of PBC is intense itching (especially in the arms, legs, and back).</p><p>Your doses may be delayed or permanently discontinued based on the results of your liver tests while using Ocaliva. You may not notice any change in symptoms, but tests will help your doctor determine if this medicine is safe and effective.</p><p>If you stop taking this medicine for any reason, talk with your doctor before you start taking it again.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Biliary Cirrhosis:</b></p><p>Initial dose: 5 mg orally once a day<br/>
