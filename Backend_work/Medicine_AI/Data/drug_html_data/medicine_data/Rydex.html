Histamine can produce symptoms of sneezing, itching, watery eyes, and runny nose.</p><p>Codeine is a narcotic cough suppressant. It affects the signals in the brain that trigger cough reflex.</p><p>Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages. Dilated blood vessels can cause nasal congestion (stuffy nose).</p><p>Rydex is a combination medicine used to treat runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, itching, watery eyes, cough, and sinus congestion caused by allergies, the common cold, or the flu.</p><p> Rydex will not treat a cough that is caused by smoking, asthma, or emphysema.</p><p>Rydex may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Codeine may be habit-forming.

Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. <b>MISUSE OF NARCOTIC MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Selling or giving away codeine is against the law.</p><p>Measure liquid medicine with the dosing syringe provided, or with a special dose-measuring spoon or medicine cup.
