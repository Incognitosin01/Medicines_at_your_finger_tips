It is also used to relieve pain and itching caused by conditions such as sunburn or other minor burns, insect bites or stings, poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, minor cuts, or scratches. <i>Xylocaine® jelly</i> is used to treat painful urethritis (inflammation of the urethra). It is also used to prevent and control pain in procedures involving the male and female urethra. <i>Xylocaine® jelly</i> is also used to lubricate the nose, mouth, and throat for intubation.</p><p>Lidocaine <i>viscous topical solution</i> is also used to treat sore mouth or throat and also reduce gagging during the taking of X-ray pictures and dental impressions.</p><p>Lidocaine <i>skin patch</i> is used to relieve nerve pain caused by herpes zoster or shingles (postherpetic neuralgia).</p><p>Lidocaine belongs to the family of medicines called local anesthetics.
