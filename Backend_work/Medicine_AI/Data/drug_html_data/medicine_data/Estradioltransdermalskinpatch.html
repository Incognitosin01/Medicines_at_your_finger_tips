Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Apply the skin patch to clean, dry skin on your stomach or buttocks. Press the patch firmly into place for at least 10 seconds. Choose a different spot within these skin areas each time you apply a new patch. Do not use the same skin area twice within 7 days. Avoid skin that is irritated or damaged.</p><p>Do not apply a skin patch to your breasts. Do not apply a patch where it might be rubbed off by tight clothing, such as under an elastic waistband. <b>Never cut a skin patch.</b></p><p>If a patch falls off, try sticking it back into place. If it does not stick well, put on a new patch on a different skin area and leave it on only for the rest of your wearing time. Do not change your patch removal schedule.</p><p>Remove the patch and apply a new one on the same day(s) each week to stay on your once-weekly or twice-weekly schedule.</p><p>Estradiol may increase your risk of developing a condition that may lead to uterine cancer. Your doctor may prescribe a progestin to help lower this risk. <b>Report any unusual vaginal bleeding right away.</b></p><p>If you need major surgery or will be on long-term bed rest, you may need to stop using this medicine for a short time. Any doctor or surgeon who treats you should know that you are using estradiol.</p><p>Your doctor should check your progress on a regular basis to determine whether you should continue this treatment.
