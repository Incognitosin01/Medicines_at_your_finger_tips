If extravasation occurs during administration, severe local tissue necrosis will occur; never administer via IM or subQ routes. Administer only under the supervision of a physician who is experienced in leukemia chemotherapy and in facilities that can monitor for drug tolerance and toxicity. The physician and institution must be able to respond to severe hemorrhagic conditions or overwhelming infection. Like other anthracyclines, idarubicin hydrochloride injection can cause myocardial toxicity leading to congestive heart failure. Cardiac toxicity is more common in patients who have received prior anthracyclines or who have preexisting cardiac disease. Severe myelosuppression will occur with idarubicin hydrochloride when used at therapeutic doses and dose reductions are required for patients with impaired hepatic or renal function</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

It seems to interfere with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by idarubicin, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur for months or years after the medicine is used.</p><p>Before you begin treatment with idarubicin, you and your doctor should talk about the benefit as the risks of using idarubicin.</p><p>Idarubicin is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using idarubicin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of idarubicin</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you idarubicin in a hospital or cancer treatment center. Idarubicin is given through a needle placed in one of your veins. The medicine must be injected slowly, so your IV tube will need to stay in place for 10 to 15 minutes every day for 3 days.</p><p>Idarubicin is sometimes given together with certain other medicines. If you are receiving a combination of medicines, it is important that you receive each one at the proper time. If you are taking some of these medicines by mouth, ask your doctor to help you plan a way to take them at the right times.</p><p>While you are receiving idarubicin, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids so that you will pass more urine. This will help prevent kidney problems and keep your kidneys working well.</p><p>Idarubicin often causes nausea and vomiting. However, it is very important that you continue to receive it, even if you begin to feel ill. Ask your doctor for ways to lessen these effects.</p><h3>Missed dose</h3><p>Idarubicin needs to be given on a fixed schedule. If you miss a dose, call your doctor, home health caregiver, or treatment clinic for instructions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using idarubicin</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check you closely</i> to make sure that idarubicin is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain or discomfort, fast or irregular heartbeat, swelling of the feet and lower legs, or troubled breathing after receiving idarubicin.</p><p>Idarubicin can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>If idarubicin accidentally seeps out of the vein into which it is injected, it may damage some tissues and cause scarring. Tell your right away if you notice redness, pain, or swelling at the injection site.</p><p>While you are being treated with idarubicin, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Idarubicin may lower your body's resistance, and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have taken oral polio vaccine. Do not get close to them, and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Idarubicin side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
