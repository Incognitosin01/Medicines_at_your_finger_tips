These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin‑associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (&gt; 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally &gt; 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.</p><p>If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of RIOMET ER. In RIOMET ER treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.</p><p>Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue RIOMET ER and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.</p><p>For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:</p><p>The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient’s renal function include <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>:</p><h3>Vitamin B12 Deficiency</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials of 29 week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B<span class="Sub">12</span> absorption from the B<span class="Sub">12</span>-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on RIOMET ER and manage any abnormalities <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues</h3><p class="First">Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. RIOMET ER may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with RIOMET ER <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metformin Immediate-Release</span></p><p>In a U.S. clinical trial of metformin immediate-release tablet in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a total of 141 patients received metformin immediate-release tablet up to 2,550 mg per day.

Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk <span class="Italics">[see Data].</span> There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Considerations].</span></p><p>No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 2-and 5‑times, respectively, a 2,550 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area <span class="Italics">[see Data].</span></p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus with an HbA1C &gt;7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a HbA1C &gt;10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk</span></p><p>Poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Published data from post-marketing studies have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin-associated risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Metformin hydrochloride did not adversely affect development outcomes when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of about 2 and 5 times a 2,550 mg clinical dose based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk <span class="Italics">[see Data].</span> However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of metformin on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for RIOMET ER and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from RIOMET ER or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Data</span></span></p><p>Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of RIOMET ER as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established. Use of RIOMET ER for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of metformin HCl immediate-release tablet in adults with additional data from a controlled clinical study using metformin HCl immediate-release tablets in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>.</p><p>Safety and effectiveness of RIOMET ER have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years old.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Controlled clinical studies of metformin HCl immediate-release tablet and HCl extended-release tablet did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. RIOMET ER is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. RIOMET ER is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdose of metformin HCl has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin hydrochloride has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected.</p><h2>Riomet Oral Suspension Description</h2><p class="First">RIOMET ER (metformin hydrochloride for extended-release oral suspension) is a biguanide. The chemical name of metformin hydrochloride is <span class="Italics">N</span>,<span class="Italics">N</span>-dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide hydrochloride. The structural formula is as shown below:</p><p>Metformin hydrochloride, USP is a white crystalline powder with a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">4</span>H<span class="Sub">11</span>N<span class="Sub">5</span>•HCl and a molecular weight of 165.62. It is freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in alcohol; practically insoluble in acetone and in methylene chloride. The pK<span class="Sub">a</span> of metformin is 12.4. The pH of a 1% aqueous solution of metformin hydrochloride, USP is 6.37 to 6.53.</p><p>RIOMET ER is available as follows:</p><p>Following reconstitution, the volume of the oral suspension is 473.12 mL (16 oz.) containing 500 mg/5mL metformin HCl equivalent to 389.95 mg metformin base.</p><p>The oral suspension include the following inactive ingredients: carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, colloidal silicon dioxide, dibutyl sebacate, ethyl cellulose, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, methyl paraben, microcrystalline cellulose, propyl paraben, sucralose, strawberry flavor Type FL # 28082 (flavoring ingredients, propylene glycol and glycerin) xanthan gum and xylitol.</p><h2>Riomet Oral Suspension - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mean (±SD)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">T<span class="Sub">max</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">(hr)#</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Median (Range)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">AUC<span class="Sub">0-t</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Mean (±SD)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">t<span class="Sub">1/2</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">(hr)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Mean (±SD)</span></p><p class="First">Fasting condition</p><p>(N = 52)</p><p class="First">1067.56</p><p>±</p><p>377.11</p><p class="First">(3.50 to 6.50)</p><p class="First">7472.02</p><p>±</p><p>1946.10</p><p class="First">4.63</p><p>±</p><p>1.97</p><p class="First">Fed condition</p><p>(N = 52)</p><p class="First">815.39</p><p>±</p><p>180.15</p><p class="First">5.50</p><p>(3.50 to 10.00)</p><p class="First">7694.78</p><p>±</p><p>1692.11</p><p class="First">4.19</p><p>±</p><p>1.03</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2,550 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day.</p><p>There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> tests: Ames test (<span class="Italics">S. typhimurium</span>), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes).
