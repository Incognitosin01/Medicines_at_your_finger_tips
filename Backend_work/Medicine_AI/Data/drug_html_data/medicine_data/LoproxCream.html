The chemical name is 6-cyclohexyl-1-hydroxy-4-methyl-2(1<span class="Italics">H</span>)-pyridone, 2-aminoethanol salt.</p><p>The CAS Registry Number is 41621-49-2. The chemical structure is:</p><h2>Loprox Cream - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Ciclopirox is a hydroxypyridone antifungal agent that acts by chelation of polyvalent cations (Fe<span class="Sup">3+</span> or Al<span class="Sup">3+</span>), resulting in the inhibition of the metal-dependent enzymes that are responsible for the degradation of peroxides within the fungal cell.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Pharmacokinetic studies in men with tagged ciclopirox solution in polyethylene glycol 400 showed an average of 1.3% absorption of the dose when it was applied topically to 750 cm<span class="Sup">2</span> on the back followed by occlusion for 6 hours. The biological half-life was 1.7 hours and excretion occurred via the kidney. Two days after application only 0.01% of the dose applied could be found in the urine. Fecal excretion was negligible.</p><p>Penetration studies in human cadaverous skin from the back, with LOPROX<span class="Sup">®</span> Cream with tagged ciclopirox showed the presence of 0.8 to 1.6% of the dose in the stratum corneum 1.5 to 6 hours after application. The levels in the dermis were still 10 to 15 times above the minimum inhibitory concentrations.</p><p>Autoradiographic studies with human cadaverous skin showed that ciclopirox penetrates into the hair and through the epidermis and hair follicles into the sebaceous glands and dermis, while a portion of the drug remains in the stratum corneum.</p><p>Draize Human Sensitization Assay, 21-Day Cumulative Irritancy study, Phototoxicity study, and Photo-Draize study conducted in a total of 142 healthy male subjects showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity, and no photo-contact sensitization due to LOPROX<span class="Sup">®</span> Cream.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Loprox Cream</h2><p class="First">LOPROX<span class="Sup">®</span> Cream is indicated for the topical treatment of the following dermal infections: tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis due to <span class="Italics">Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum,</span> and <span class="Italics">Microsporum canis;</span> candidiasis (moniliasis) due to <span class="Italics">Candida albicans;</span> and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor due to <span class="Italics">Malassezia furfur.</span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">LOPROX<span class="Sup">®</span> Cream is contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its components.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">LOPROX<span class="Sup">®</span> Cream is not for ophthalmic use.</p><p><span class="Bold">Keep out of reach of children.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur with the use of LOPROX<span class="Sup">®</span> Cream, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><h3>Information for Patientss</h3><p class="First">The patient should be told to:</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">A 104-week dermal carcinogenicity study in mice was conducted with ciclopirox cream applied at doses up to 1.93% (100 mg/kg/day or 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day). No increase in drug related neoplasms was noted when compared to control.</p><p>The following in vitro genotoxicity tests have been conducted with ciclopirox: evaluation of gene mutation in the Ames Salmonella and E. coli assays (negative); chromosome aberration assays in V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells, with and without metabolic activation (positive); chromosome aberration assays in V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells in the presence of supplemental Fe<span class="Sup">3+</span>, with and without metabolic activation (negative); gene mutation assays in the HGPRT-test with V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells (negative); and a primary DNA damage assay (i.e., unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in A549 human cells) (negative). An <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> cell transformation assay in BALB/c 3T3 cells was negative for cell transformation. In an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> Chinese hamster bone marrow cytogenetic assay, ciclopirox was negative for chromosome aberrations at a dosage of 5000 mg/kg body weight.</p><p>A combined oral fertility and embryofetal developmental study was conducted in rats with ciclopirox olamine. No effect on fertility or reproductive performance was noted at the highest dose tested of 3.85 mg/kg/day ciclopirox (approximately 1.2 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area comparisons).</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, LOPROX<span class="Sup">®</span> Cream should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>Oral embryofetal developmental studies were conducted in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. Ciclopirox or ciclopirox olamine was orally administered during the period of organogenesis. No maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity were noted at the highest doses of 77, 125, 80 and 38.5 mg/kg/day ciclopirox in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys, respectively (approximately 11, 37, 51 and 24 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area comparisons, respectively).</p><p>Dermal embryofetal developmental studies were conducted in rats and rabbits with ciclopirox olamine dissolved in PEG 400. Ciclopirox olamine was topically administered during the period of organogenesis. No maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity were noted at the highest doses of 92 mg/kg/day and 77 mg/kg/day ciclopirox in rats and rabbits, respectively (approximately 27 and 49 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area comparisons, respectively).</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when LOPROX<span class="Sup">®</span> Cream is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 10 years have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">In all controlled clinical studies with 514 patients using LOPROX<span class="Sup">®</span> Cream and in 296 patients using the vehicle cream, the incidence of adverse reactions was low. This included pruritus at the site of application in one patient and worsening of the clinical signs and symptoms in another patient using ciclopirox cream and burning in one patient and worsening of the clinical signs and symptoms in another patient using the vehicle cream.</p><h2>Loprox Cream Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Gently massage LOPROX<span class="Sup">®</span> Cream into the affected and surrounding skin areas twice daily, in the morning and evening. Clinical improvement with relief of pruritus and other symptoms usually occurs within the first week of treatment. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after four weeks of treatment with LOPROX<span class="Sup">®</span> Cream, the diagnosis should be redetermined. Patients with tinea versicolor usually exhibit clinical and mycological clearing after two weeks of treatment.</p><h2>How is Loprox Cream Supplied</h2><p class="First">LOPROX<span class="Sup">®</span> Cream (ciclopirox) 0.77% is supplied in</p><p>90 gram (NDC 43538-540-90)</p><h3>STORAGE</h3><p class="First">Store at 15º - 30ºC (59º - 86ºF).</p><p>To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Medimetriks Pharmaceuticals, Inc., at 1-973-882-8812 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</p><p class="First">Manufactured for:</p><p><span class="Bold">MEDIMETRIKS</span><br/>
