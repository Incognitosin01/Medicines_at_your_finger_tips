Data from a randomized study in patients with endometrial hyperplasia without atypia also support the use of levonorgestrel IUD to treat endometrial hyperplasia <sup>[Dolapcioglu 2013]</sup>. Clinical experience also suggests the utility of levonorgestrel IUD for non-surgical management of endometrial hyperplasia (with or without atypia) or endometrial precancers; the duration is dependent on the diagnosis (endometrial hyperplasia without atypia; benign endometrial hyperplasia/atypical hyperplasia) as well as patient specific factors <sup>[Armstrong 2012]</sup>, <sup>[Trimble 2012]</sup>.

If significant bleeding irregularities continue with prolonged use, conduct diagnostic tests to assess possible endometrial pathology (polyps or cancer). An increase in menstrual bleeding may indicate a partial or complete expulsion of the IUD (see dosage form specific issues). Unexplained vaginal bleeding should be evaluated prior to insertion (Curtis 2016b); use is contraindicated with unexplained uterine bleeding.</p><p>• Bradycardia/syncope: Bradycardia or syncope may occur during insertion or removal of the IUD; use with caution in patients predisposed to these conditions.</p><p>• Breast cancer: Breast cancer is a hormonal sensitive tumor. Use is contraindicated in women with (or history of) breast cancer. Reports of breast cancer have been reported with levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs.</p><p>• Ectopic pregnancy: Use caution in patients with previous ectopic pregnancy. Women with history of ectopic pregnancy were excluded from clinical trials; women with previous ectopic pregnancy, tubal surgery, or pelvic infection may be at increased risk for ectopic pregnancy. The possibility of ectopic pregnancy should be considered in patients with lower abdominal pain, especially in association with missed periods or new-onset vaginal bleeding in women with prior amenorrhea. Ectopic pregnancy may result in loss of fertility.</p><p>• Ovarian cysts: May occur during IUD use; most are asymptomatic and disappear spontaneously within 2 to 3 months. Evaluate if persistent.</p><p>• Pelvic inflammatory disease: An increased incidence of group A streptococcal sepsis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or endometritis (may be asymptomatic), and actinomycosis has been reported with use. Using aseptic technique during insertion is essential to minimizing the risk of serious infections. PID occurs more frequently within the first year and most often within the first month after insertion; risk is increased with multiple sexual partners. Women with a history of PID or endometritis are at increased risk. If PID is diagnosed, treat according to current guidelines and reassess in 48 to 72 hours. If there is no clinical improvement, continue antibiotics and consider removal of device (Curtis 2016a). Women with symptomatic actinomycosis should have the device removed and be treated with the appropriate antibiotics. Remove IUD in cases of recurrent endometritis or PID, or if an acute pelvic infection is severe or does not respond to treatment.</p><p>• Seizure: Insertion or removal may be associated with seizure, especially in patients predisposed to seizures.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cervical or endometrial cancer: Women diagnosed with cervical or endometrial cancer prior to IUD insertion should not use an IUD for pregnancy prevention (may have in increased risk of bleeding or infection when the device is inserted). Women diagnosed after insertion of an IUD may continue; however, the IUD will most likely need to be removed during treatment (Curtis 2016b). Use is contraindicated in women with progestin sensitive cancer.</p><p>• Depression: Use with caution in patients with depression; may be more susceptible to recurrence of depressive episodes; consider removal of IUD for serious recurrence. Depression is not a contraindication to use of the IUD (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Gestational trophoblastic disease: Women with gestational trophoblastic disease are at increased risk of adverse events if pregnancy occurs; use of the levonorgestrel IUD may be appropriate for prevention of pregnancy in some situations with close medical supervision. However, women with persistently elevated beta-hCG concentrations or malignant disease with evidence or suspicion of intrauterine disease should not initiate therapy with a levonorgestrel IUD due to risks of infection, hemorrhage, or perforation. Consider benefits of effective contraception versus risks of continuation/removal in women who have a levonorgestrel IUD already in place (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Sepsis: The levonorgestrel IUD should not be inserted in women with postpartum sepsis or immediately following a septic abortion (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Sexually transmitted disease: Use of the levonorgestrel IUD should not be initiated in women with purulent cervicitis, chlamydial, or gonococcal infection. The IUD does not need to be removed if diagnosis occurs with the IUD in place, as long as there is treatment with appropriate antibiotics, and consideration is given to personal risk factors and patient preference (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Tuberculosis: The levonorgestrel IUD may be inserted in women with nonpelvic tuberculosis; do not initiate treatment in cases of pelvic infection and consider removal when pelvic infection occurs with the IUD in place (Curtis 2016b).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Obesity: Obesity is not a contraindication to levonorgestrel IUD use; clinical trials did not exclude women based on BMI (Curtis 2016a).</p><p>• Pediatric: Not for use prior to menarche.</p><p>• Postmenopausal women: Not indicated for use in postmenopausal women.</p><p>• Smokers: The risk of cardiovascular side effects increases in women using estrogen containing combined hormonal contraceptives and who smoke cigarettes, especially those who are &gt;35 years of age. This risk relative to progestin-only contraceptives has not been established. Women who take contraceptives should be advised not to smoke. Smoking is not a contraindication to use of the IUD (Curtis 2016b).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Consent form: Some products provide a consent form; a copy of the form and lot number should be kept with the woman's medical record.</p><p>• Expulsion: Partial or complete expulsion may occur; may be associated with symptoms of bleeding or pain or may be asymptomatic and go unnoticed. An increase in menstrual bleeding may indicate a partial or complete expulsion of the IUD. If the IUD is not found in the uterus, consider further testing to confirm expulsion (eg, sonography, X-ray). The risk of expulsion may be increased when the uterus is not completely involuted. If expulsion occurs, remove device; may replace device any time the health care professional assesses that the woman is not pregnant.</p><p>• MRI: Only under specific conditions may an IUD be scanned safely by MRI (refer to manufacturer's labeling for requirements). Image quality may also be impaired if area of interest is relatively close to the device.</p><p>• Perforation: Total or partial perforation may occur, most often during insertion but can occur at any time during use. Perforation may include penetration/embedment in the uterus or cervix; risk of perforation is increased in lactating women and when the uterus is fixed retroverted or not completely involuted during the postpartum period. Perforation may reduce contraceptive efficacy and result in pregnancy. If perforation occurs, locate and remove IUD; delayed detection or removal in cases of perforation may result in migration of IUD outside of uterine cavity, adhesions, peritonitis, intestinal perforations, intestinal obstruction, abscesses, and erosion of adjacent viscera.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: IUD: Insertion should be done by a trained health care provider. Insertion and removal may be associated with pain and/or bleeding; consider analgesics prior to insertion. Removal of the device may be necessary for the following reasons: pelvic infection or disease, endometritis, symptomatic genital actinomycosis, uterine or cervical cancer, uterine or cervical perforation, partial expulsion, and pregnancy. Use with caution if any of the following conditions exist and consider removal if any of them arise during use: Coagulopathy or are receiving anticoagulants; marked increase of blood pressure; severe arterial disease, such as stroke or MI; exceptionally severe headache; and migraine, focal migraine with asymmetrical visual loss, or other symptoms indicating transient cerebral ischemia. In addition, consider removal if jaundice occurs during use. Not effective for emergency contraception.</p><p>• HIV infection protection: Intrauterine devices do not protect against HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Laboratory changes: The use of estrogens and/or progestins may change the results of some laboratory tests (eg, coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, binding proteins). The dose, route, and the specific estrogen/progestin influences these changes. In addition, personal risk factors (eg, cardiovascular disease, smoking, diabetes, age) also contribute to adverse events; use of specific products may be contraindicated in women with certain risk factors.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Prior to insertion: Assessment of pregnancy status; bimanual examination and cervical inspection; weight (optional; BMI at baseline may be helpful to monitor changes during therapy); STD screen (unless already screened according to CDC STD Treatment guidelines) (Curtis 2016a). Complete medical and social history which may determine conditions influencing an IUD use for contraception.</p><p>Following insertion: Transvaginal ultrasound may be used to check placement. Changes in health status (including medications) should be assessed at routine follow-up visits (Curtis 2016a). Re-examine following insertion (4 to 6 weeks Kyleena, Liletta, Mirena, Skyla; 4 to 12 weeks Jaydess [Canadian product]) and then yearly or more frequently if necessary. Threads should be visible; if length of thread has changed device may have become displaced, broken, perforated the uterus, or expelled. Monitor for significant changes in menstrual bleeding during prolonged use, Pap smear, blood pressure, serum glucose in patients with diabetes. Patients presenting with lower abdominal pain should be evaluated for ovarian cysts and ectopic pregnancy. Signs of infection. Monitor for signs/symptoms of thromboembolism in women who require surgery with prolonged immobilization.</p><p>Endometrial hyperplasia, treatment (off-label use): Endometrial sampling every 3 to 6 months, although most appropriate frequency has not been determined (ACOG 631 2015; Trimble 2012).</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Evaluate pregnancy status prior to insertion.</p><p>The device may be inserted immediately following a first trimester-induced or spontaneous abortion. Following pregnancy or a second trimester-induced or spontaneous abortion, the manufacturer recommends that insertion of the device should not take place for at least 6 weeks or until involution of the uterus is complete. However, evidence-based guidelines recommend that insertion postpartum (immediate insertion within 10 minutes of placental delivery or interval insertion during the 6-week postpartum period) or following an abortion are safe despite a higher risk of expulsion immediately postpartum and following a second trimester abortion and may be offered regardless of breastfeeding status to help prevent rapid repeat and unintended pregnancies (ACOG 186 2017; Curtis 2016b).</p><p>Following removal of the device, ~71% to 85% of women who wished to conceive became pregnant within 12 months.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Use during pregnancy or a suspected pregnancy is contraindicated.</p><p>Women who become pregnant with an IUD in place risk septic abortion; septicemia, septic shock, and death may occur. Removal of the device is recommended; however, removal or manipulation of IUD or probing of the uterus may result in pregnancy loss. In addition, if pregnancy occurs with an IUD in place, the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy is increased; miscarriage, sepsis, premature labor, and premature delivery may occur if pregnancy is continued.</p><p>Masculinization of the female fetus has been reported following in utero exposure to progestins at doses greater than those used for oral contraception.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to prevent pregnancy and heavy bleeding during monthly periods (menstruation).</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
