Budesonide is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the body. Formoterol is a long-acting bronchodilator that relaxes muscles in the airways to improve breathing.</p><p>Symbicort is used to control and prevent the symptoms of asthma in adults and children at least 6 years old.</p><p>Symbicort is also used to help control the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.</p><p>Symbicort is not for use in treating an asthma or bronchospasm attack.</p><p>For people with asthma: Symbicort is for use only if asthma is severe or is not well-controlled on other long-term asthma medicines. Your doctor may tell you to stop using this medicine once your asthma is well-controlled.</p><p>Formoterol when used alone may increase the risk of death in people with asthma. However, this risk is not increased when budesonide and formoterol are used together as a combination product.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Symbicort is not a rescue medicine. It will not work fast enough to treat an asthma or bronchospasm attack.</p><p><b>Seek medical attention you have worsening breathing problems, or if you think your medications are not working as well.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Symbicort if you are allergic to budesonide or formoterol.</p><p>Budesonide can weaken your immune system. Tell your doctor about any illness or infection you've had within the past several weeks.</p><p>To make sure Symbicort is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

It is not known whether budesonide or formoterol will harm an unborn baby. However, having untreated or uncontrolled asthma during pregnancy may cause complications such as low birth weight, premature birth, or eclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure that can lead to medical problems in both mother and baby). The benefit of treating asthma may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using Symbicort. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><p>Symbicort is not approved for use by anyone younger than 6 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use Symbicort?</h2><p>Symbicort comes with a medication guide for safe and effective use, and directions for priming and cleaning the Symbicort inhaler device. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Use the medicine exactly as directed. Using too much of this medicine can cause life-threatening side effects.</p><p>If you also use an oral steroid medication, you should not stop using it suddenly. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.</p><p><b>Symbicort is not a rescue medicine for asthma or bronchospasm attacks.</b> Use only fast-acting inhalation medicine for an attack. Seek medical attention if your breathing problems get worse quickly, or if you think your asthma medications are not working as well.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Do not allow a young child to use Symbicort without help from an adult.</p><p>Rinse your mouth with water after each use of your inhaler.</p><p>It may take up to 1 week before your symptoms improve.

Do not change your medication dose or schedule without your doctor's advice.</p><p>If you use a peak flow meter at home, tell your doctor if your numbers are lower than normal.</p><p>Store at room temperature in an upright position, with the mouthpiece down.

Continue reading</p><p>Symbicort is used for long-term treatment in both asthma and COPD.
