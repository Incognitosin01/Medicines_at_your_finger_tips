</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Immune Modulator</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Zyclara</h2><p>Imiquimod topical is used to treat external warts around the genital and rectal areas called condyloma acuminatum. It is not used on warts inside the vagina, penis, or rectum. Imiquimod is also used to treat a skin condition of the face and scalp called actinic keratosis (AK), which is caused by too much sun exposure. Imiquimod may be used to treat certain types of skin cancer called superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC).</p><p>Imiquimod works on the immune system to help the body fight viruses that cause warts. It does not destroy the viruses directly. It is not known how imiquimod works for actinic keratosis or skin cancer.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Zyclara</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
