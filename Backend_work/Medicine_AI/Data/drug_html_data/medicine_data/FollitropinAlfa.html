Follitropins stimulate ovarian follicular growth in women who do not have primary ovarian failure, and stimulate spermatogenesis in men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. FSH is required for normal follicular growth, maturation, gonadal steroid production, and spermatogenesis. </p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>SubQ: Absorption rate is slower than the elimination rate</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Mean V<sub>d</sub>: 0.7 L with <i>in vitro</i> fertilization/embryo transfer patients</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Clearance: IV: 0.6 L/hour in healthy female volunteers</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>Peak effect:</p><p>Spermatogenesis, median: 6.8-12.4 months (range: 2.7-18.1 months) </p><p>Follicle development: Within cycle</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>In healthy volunteers:</p><p>Females: SubQ: 8-16 hours</p><p>Males: SubQ: 11-20 hours</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>SubQ: 24-53 hours in healthy female volunteers; 32-41 hours in healthy male volunteers</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Multifollicular development during Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART):</b> To stimulate the development of multiple follicles with ART</p><p><b>Ovulation induction:</b> Induction of ovulation and pregnancy in oligo-anovulatory infertile patients in whom the cause of infertility is functional and not caused by primary ovarian failure</p><p><b>Spermatogenesis induction (Gonal-f only):</b> Induction of spermatogenesis in men with primary and secondary hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in whom the cause of infertility is not due to primary testicular failure</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to follitropins or any component of the formulation; high levels of FSH indicating primary gonadal failure (ovarian or testicular); sex hormone dependent tumors of the reproductive tract and accessory organs; intracranial lesions (eg, pituitary or hypothalamus tumor); uncontrolled thyroid, pituitary or adrenal dysfunction; abnormal uterine bleeding of undetermined origin; ovarian cysts or enlargement of undetermined origin not due to polycystic ovary syndrome; pregnancy</p><p><i>Canadian labeling</i>: Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Presence of any cause for infertility other than anovulation (unless candidate for ART); lactation</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Dose should be individualized. Use the lowest dose consistent with the expectation of good results. Over the course of treatment, doses may vary depending on individual patient response.</p><p><b>Ovulation induction:</b> Females: SubQ: Initial: 75 units daily; incremental dose adjustments of up to 37.5 units may be considered after 14 days; further dose increases of the same magnitude can be made, if necessary, every 7 days (maximum dose: 300 units daily). Treatment should be continued until follicular growth and/or serum estradiol levels indicate an adequate ovarian response. If response to follitropin is appropriate, hCG is given 1 day following the last dose to induce final oocyte maturation and ovulation. Withhold hCG if serum estradiol is &gt;2000 pg/mL; discontinue if the ovaries are abnormally enlarged, or if abdominal pain occurs. In general, therapy should not exceed 35 days.</p><p><b>Multifollicular development during ART:</b> Females: SubQ: Initiate therapy with follitropin alfa in the early follicular phase (cycle day 2 or day 3) at a dose of 150 units daily, until sufficient follicular development is attained. In most cases, therapy should not exceed 10 days. In patients ≥35 years whose endogenous gonadotropin levels are suppressed, initiate follitropin alfa at a dose of 225 units daily. Continue treatment until adequate follicular development is indicated as determined by ultrasound in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels. Consider adjustments to dose after 5 days based on the patient's response; adjust subsequent dosage every 3-5 days by ≤75-150 units additionally at each adjustment. Doses &gt;450 units daily are not recommended. Once adequate follicular development is evident, administer hCG to induce final follicular maturation in preparation for oocyte retrieval. Withhold hCG if the ovaries are abnormally enlarged.</p><p><b>Spermatogenesis induction:</b> Males: <i>Gonal-f:</i> SubQ: Therapy should begin with hCG pretreatment until serum testosterone is in normal range, then initiate Gonal-f at 150 units 3 times weekly with hCG 3 times weekly; continue with lowest dose needed to induce spermatogenesis (maximum dose: 300 units 3 times weekly); may be given for up to 18 months</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.

If ovaries are abnormally enlarged on the last day of treatment, withhold hCG to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).</p><p>• Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS): OHSS is a rare exaggerated response to ovulation induction therapy (Corbett 2014; Fiedler 2012). This syndrome may begin within 24 hours of treatment but may become most severe 7 to 10 days after therapy (Corbett 2014). Symptoms of mild/moderate OHSS may include abdominal distention/discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, and/or vomiting. Severe OHSS symptoms may include severe abdominal pain, anuria/oliguria, ascites, severe dyspnea, hypotension, or nausea/vomiting (intractable). Decreased creatinine clearance, hemoconcentration, hypoproteinemia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated WBC, and electrolyte imbalances may also be present (ASRM 2016; Corbett 2014; Fiedler 2012). Treatment is primarily symptomatic and includes fluid and electrolyte management, analgesics, and prevention of thromboembolic complications (ASRM 2016; SOGC-CFAS 2011). Therapy with gonadotropins should be stopped.</p><p>• Ovarian neoplasms: Benign and malignant neoplasms have been reported (infrequently) in women receiving multiple-drug therapy for controlled ovarian stimulation; causal effect has not been established.</p><p>• Ovarian torsion: Has been reported following gonadotropin treatment; may be related to OHSS, prior ovarian torsion, prior or current ovarian cyst, polycystic ovaries, pregnancy, or prior abdominal surgery. Early diagnosis and prompt detorsion may limit the extent of ovarian damage.</p><p>• Pulmonary effects: Serious pulmonary conditions (atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and exacerbation of asthma) have been reported.</p><p>• Thromboembolic events: In association with and separate from ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), thromboembolic events have been reported.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Multiple-dose injection pens: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), pen-shaped injection devices should never be used for more than one person (even when the needle is changed) because of the risk of infection. The injection device should be clearly labeled with individual patient information to ensure that the correct pen is used (CDC, 2012).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: To minimize risks, use only at the lowest effective dose. Monitor ovarian response with serum estradiol and vaginal ultrasound on a regular basis.</p><p>• Experienced physician: These medications should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.</p><p>• Multiple births: May result from the use of these medications; advise patient of the potential risk of multiple births before starting the treatment.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor sufficient follicular maturation. This may be directly estimated by sonographic visualization of the ovaries and endometrial lining or measuring serum estradiol levels. The combination of both ultrasonography and measurement of estradiol levels is useful for monitoring for the growth and development of follicles and timing hCG administration.</p><p>The clinical evaluation of estrogenic activity (changes in vaginal cytology and changes in appearance and volume of cervical mucus) provides an indirect estimate of the estrogenic effect upon the target organs and, therefore, it should only be used adjunctively with more direct estimates of follicular development (ultrasonography and serum estradiol determinations).</p><p>The clinical confirmation of ovulation is obtained by direct and indirect indices of progesterone production or by sonographic evidence. The indices of progesterone production most generally used are: urinary or serum luteinizing hormone (LH) rise, rise in basal body temperature, increase in serum progesterone, and menstruation following the shift in basal body temperature. The indices of sonographic evidence of ovulation include: Collapsed follicle, fluid in the cul-de-sac, features consistent with corpus luteum formation, or secretory endometrium.</p><p>Monitor for signs and symptoms of OHSS for at least 2 weeks following hCG administration.</p><p>OHSS: Monitoring of hospitalized patients should include abdominal circumference, albumin, cardiorespiratory status, electrolytes, fluid balance, hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum creatinine, urine output, urine specific gravity, vital signs, weight (all daily or as necessary), and liver enzymes (weekly) (SOGC-CFAS 2011).</p><p>Spermatogenesis: Monitor serum testosterone levels, sperm count</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Follitropin Alfa is used for the induction of ovulation; use is contraindicated in women who are already pregnant.</p><p>Ectopic pregnancy, congenital abnormalities, spontaneous abortion, and multiple births have been reported. The incidence of congenital abnormality may be slightly higher after ART than with spontaneous conception; higher incidence may be related to parenteral characteristics (maternal age, sperm characteristics).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to help women get pregnant.</p><p>• It is used to help make sperm.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
