Idursulfase contains a natural enzyme that some people lack because of a genetic disorder. Elaprase helps replace this missing enzyme.</p><p>Hunter syndrome is a metabolic disorder in which the body lacks the enzyme needed to break down certain sugars and proteins. These substances can build up in the body, causing enlarged organs, abnormal bone structure, changes in facial features, breathing problems, heart problems, vision loss, and changes in mental or physical abilities.</p><p>Elaprase may improve walking ability in people with this condition.
