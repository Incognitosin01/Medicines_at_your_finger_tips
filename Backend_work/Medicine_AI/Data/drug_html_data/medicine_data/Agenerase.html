</ul><p class="First">Because of the potential risk of toxicity from the large amount of the excipient, propylene glycol, contained in <span class="Bold">Agenerase Oral Solution</span>, that formulation is contraindicated in infants and children below the age of 4 years and certain other patient populations and should be used with caution in others. Consult the complete prescribing information for <span class="Bold">Agenerase Oral Solution</span> for full information.</p><h2>Agenerase Description</h2><p class="First">Agenerase (amprenavir) is an inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease. The chemical name of amprenavir is (3<span class="Italics">S</span>)-tetrahydro-3-furyl <span class="Italics">N</span>-[(1<span class="Italics">S</span>,2<span class="Italics">R</span>)-3-(4-amino-<span class="Italics">N</span>-isobutylbenzenesulfonamido)-1-benzyl-2-hydroxypropyl]carbamate. Amprenavir is a single stereoisomer with the (3<span class="Italics">S</span>)(1<span class="Italics">S</span>,2<span class="Italics">R</span>) configuration. It has a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">25</span>H<span class="Sub">35</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span>S and a molecular weight of 505.64. It has the following structural formula:</p><p></p><p>Amprenavir is a white to cream-colored solid with a solubility of approximately 0.04 mg/mL in water at 25°C.</p><p><span class="Bold">Agenerase Capsules</span> are available for oral administration. Each 50-mg capsule contains the inactive ingredients d-alpha tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) 246.7 mg, and propylene glycol 19 mg. The capsule shell contains the inactive ingredients d-sorbitol and sorbitans solution, gelatin, glycerin, and titanium dioxide. The soft gelatin capsules are printed with edible red ink. Each 50-mg Agenerase Capsule contains 36.3 IU vitamin E in the form of TPGS. The total amount of vitamin E in the recommended daily adult dose of Agenerase is 1,744 IU.</p><h2>MICROBIOLOGY</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Amprenavir is an inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. Amprenavir binds to the active site of HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag and gag-pol polyprotein precursors, resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles.</p><h3>Antiviral Activity in Vitro</h3><p class="First">The in vitro antiviral activity of amprenavir was evaluated against HIV-1 IIIB in both acutely and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<span class="Sub">50</span>) of amprenavir ranged from 0.012 to 0.08 μM in acutely infected cells and was 0.41 μM in chronically infected cells (1 μM = 0.50 mcg/mL). Amprenavir exhibited synergistic anti−HIV-1 activity incombination with abacavir, zidovudine, didanosine, or saquinavir, and additive anti−HIV-1 activity in combination with indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir in vitro. These drug combinations have not been adequately studied in humans. The relationship between in vitro anti−HIV-1 activity of amprenavir and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans has not been defined.</p><h3>Resistance</h3><p class="First">HIV-1 isolates with a decreased susceptibility to amprenavir have been selected in vitro and obtained from patients treated with amprenavir. Genotypic analysis of isolates from amprenavir-treated patients showed mutations in the HIV-1 protease gene resulting in amino acid substitutions primarily at positions V32I, M46I/L, I47V, I50V, I54L/M, and I84V as well as mutations in the p7/p1 and p1/p6 gag cleavage sites. Phenotypic analysis of HIV-1 isolates from 21 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor- (NRTI-) experienced, protease inhibitor-naive patients treated with amprenavir in combination with NRTIs for 16 to 48 weeks identified isolates from 15 patients who exhibited a 4­- to 17-fold decrease in susceptibility to amprenavir in vitro compared to wild-type virus. Clinical isolates that exhibited a decrease in amprenavir susceptibility harbored one or more amprenavir-associated mutations. The clinical relevance of the genotypic and phenotypic changes associated with amprenavir therapy is under evaluation.</p><h3>Cross-Resistance</h3><p class="First">Varying degrees ofHIV-1 cross-resistance among protease inhibitors have been observed. Five of 15 amprenavir-resistant isolates exhibited 4- to 8-fold decrease in susceptibility to ritonavir. However, amprenavir-resistant isolates were susceptible to either indinavir or saquinavir.</p><h2>Agenerase - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Pharmacokinetics in Adults</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetic properties of amprenavir have been studied in asymptomatic, HIV-infected adult patients after administration of single oral doses of 150 to 1,200 mg and multiple oral doses of 300 to 1,200 mg twice daily.</p><p class="First">Amprenavir was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in HIV-1-infected patients with a time to peak concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) typically between 1 and 2 hours after a single oral dose. The absolute oral bioavailability of amprenavir in humans has not been established.</p><p>Increases in the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) after single oral doses between 150 and 1,200 mg were slightly greater than dose proportional. Increases in AUC were dose proportional after 3 weeks of dosing with doses from 300 to 1,200 mg twice daily. The pharmacokinetic parameters after administration of amprenavir 1,200 mg twice daily for 3 weeks to HIV-infected subjects are shown in Table 1.</p><p class="First">C<span class="Sub">max</span> (mcg/mL)</p><p class="First">T<span class="Sub">max</span> (hours)</p><p class="First">AUC<span class="Sub">0-12</span> (mcg•hr/mL)</p><p class="First">C<span class="Sub">avg</span> (mcg/mL)</p><p class="First">C<span class="Sub">min</span> (mcg/mL)</p><p class="First">CL/F (mL/min/kg)</p><p class="First">7.66</p><p>(54%)</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p>(42%)</p><p class="First">17.7</p><p>(47%)</p><p class="First">1.48</p><p>(47%)</p><p class="First">0.32</p><p>(77%)</p><p class="First">19.5</p><p>(46%)</p><p>The relative bioavailability of Agenerase Capsules and Oral Solution was assessed in healthy adults. Agenerase Oral Solution was 14% less bioavailable compared to the capsules.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Effects of Food on Oral Absorption:</span> The relative bioavailability of Agenerase Capsules was assessed in the fasting and fed states in healthy volunteers (standardized high-fat meal: 967 kcal, 67 grams fat, 33 grams protein, 58 grams carbohydrate). Administration of a single 1,200-mg dose of amprenavir in the fed state compared to the fasted state was associated with changes in C<span class="Sub">max</span> (fed: 6.18 ± 2.92 mcg/mL, fasted: 9.72 ± 2.75 mcg/mL), T<span class="Sub">max</span> (fed: 1.51 ± 0.68, fasted: 1.05 ± 0.63), and AUC<span class="Sub">0-</span>∞ (fed: 22.06 ± 11.6 mcg•hr/mL, fasted: 28.05 ± 10.1 mcg•hr/mL). Agenerase may be taken with or without food, but should not be taken with a high-fat meal (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Distribution:</span> The apparent volume of distribution (V<span class="Sub">z</span>/F) is approximately 430 L in healthy adult subjects. In vitro binding is approximately 90% to plasma proteins. The high affinity binding protein for amprenavir is alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>-acid glycoprotein (AAG). The partitioning of amprenavir into erythrocytes is low, but increases as amprenavir concentrations increase, reflecting the higher amount of unbound drug at higher concentrations.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Metabolism:</span> Amprenavir is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme system. The 2 major metabolites result from oxidation of the tetrahydrofuran and aniline moieties. Glucuronide conjugates of oxidized metabolites have been identified as minor metabolites in urine and feces.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Elimination:</span> Excretion of unchanged amprenavir in urine and feces is minimal. Approximately 14% and 75% of an administered single dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-amprenavir can be accounted for as radiocarbon in urine and feces, respectively. Two metabolites accounted for &gt;90% of the radiocarbon in fecal samples. The plasma elimination half-life of amprenavir ranged from 7.1 to 10.6 hours.</p><h3>Special Populations</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Hepatic Insufficiency:</span> Agenerase has been studied in adult patients with impaired hepatic function using a single 600-mg oral dose. The AUC<span class="Sub">0-</span>∞ was significantly greater in patients with moderate cirrhosis (25.76 ± 14.68 mcg•hr/mL) compared with healthy volunteers (12.00 ± 4.38 mcg•hr/mL). The AUC<span class="Sub">0-</span>∞ and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were significantly greater in patients with severe cirrhosis (AUC<span class="Sub">0-</span>∞: 38.66 ± 16.08 mcg•hr/mL; C<span class="Sub">max</span>: 9.43 ± 2.61 mcg/mL) compared with healthy volunteers (AUC<span class="Sub">0-</span>∞: 12.00 ± 4.38 mcg•hr/mL; C<span class="Sub">max</span>: 4.90 ± 1.39 mcg/mL). Patients with impaired hepatic function require dosage adjustment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Renal Insufficiency:</span> The impact of renal impairment on amprenavir elimination in adult patients has not been studied. The renal elimination of unchanged amprenavir represents &lt;3% of the administered dose.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Pediatric Patients:</span> The pharmacokinetics of amprenavir have been studied after either single or repeat doses of Agenerase Capsules or Oral Solution in 84 pediatric patients. Twenty HIV−1-infected children ranging in age from 4 to 12 years received single doses from 5 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg using 25-mg or 150-mg capsules. The C<span class="Sub">max</span> of amprenavir increased less than proportionally with dose. The AUC<span class="Sub">0-</span>∞ increased proportionally at doses between 5 and 20 mg/kg. Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable from the liquid formulation than from the capsules; therefore <span class="Bold">Agenerase Capsules and Agenerase Oral Solution are not interchangeable on a milligram-per-milligram basis.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Agenerase Oral Solution</span> is contraindicated in infants and children below the age of 4 years due to the potential risk of toxicity from the large amount of the excipient, propylene glycol.

Through 24 weeks of therapy, 53% of patients assigned to Agenerase/zidovudine/lamivudine achieved HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/mL. Through week 48, the antiviral response was 41%. Through 24 weeks of therapy, 11% of patients assigned to zidovudine/lamivudine achieved HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/mL.

Consult the complete prescribing information for <span class="Bold">Agenerase Oral Solution</span> for full information.</p><p>Ageneraseis contraindicated in patients with previously demonstrated clinically significant hypersensitivity to any of the components of this product.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><h3>ALERT</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Find out about medicines that should not be taken with Agenerase.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Serious and/or life-threatening drug interactions could occur between amprenavir and amiodarone, lidocaine (systemic), tricyclic antidepressants, and quinidine. Concentration monitoring of these agents is recommended if these agents are used concomitantly with Agenerase (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</span></p><p>Rifampin should not be used in combination with amprenavir because it reduces plasma concentrations and AUC of amprenavir by about 90%.</p><p>A drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ritonavir significantly increases plasma fluticasone propionate exposures, resulting in significantly decreased serum cortisol concentrations. Concomitant use of Agenerase with ritonavir and fluticasone propionate is expected to produce the same effects. Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenalsuppression have been reported during postmarketing use in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate. Therefore, coadministration of fluticasone propionate and Agenerase/ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).</p><p>Concomitant use of Agenerase and St. John's wort (hypericum perforatum) or products containing St. John’s wort is not recommended. Coadministration of protease inhibitors, including Agenerase, with St. John's wort is expected to substantially decrease protease inhibitor concentrations and may result in suboptimal levels of amprenavir and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to Agenerase or to the class of protease inhibitors.</p><p>Concomitant use of Agenerase with lovastatin or simvastatin is not recommended. Caution should be exercised if HIV protease inhibitors, including Agenerase, are used concurrently with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are also metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway (e.g., atorvastatin). The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, may be increased when HIV protease inhibitors, including amprenavir, are used in combination with these drugs.</p><p>Particular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil in patients receiving amprenavir. Coadministration of Agenerase with sildenafil is expected to substantially increase sildenafil concentrations and may result in an increase in sildenafil-associated adverse events, including hypotension, visual changes, and priapism (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and Information for Patients, and the complete prescribing information for sildenafil).</p><p>Because of the potential toxicity from the large amount of the excipient, propylene glycol, contained in <span class="Bold">Agenerase Oral Solution</span>, that formulation is contraindicated in certain patient populations and should be used with caution in others. Consult the complete prescribing information for <span class="Bold">Agenerase Oral Solution</span> for full information.</p><p><span class="Bold">Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have occurred in patients treated with Agenerase (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).</span> Acute hemolytic anemia has been reported in a patient treated with Agenerase.</p><p>New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and causal relationships between protease inhibitor therapy and these events have not been established.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Agenerase Capsules and Agenerase Oral Solution are not interchangeable on a milligram-per-milligram basis</span><span class="Bold">(see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pediatric Patients).</span></p><p>Amprenavir is a sulfonamide. The potential for cross-sensitivity between drugs in the sulfonamide class and amprenavir is unknown. Agenerase should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy.</p><p>Agenerase is principally metabolized by the liver. Agenerase, when used alone and in combination with low-dose ritonavir, has been associated with elevations of SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) in some patients. Caution should be exercised when administering Agenerase to patients with hepatic impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with Agenerase and at periodic intervals during treatment.</p><p>Formulations of Agenerase provide high daily doses of vitamin E (see Information for Patients, DESCRIPTION, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). The effects of long-term, high-dose vitamin E administration in humans is not well characterized and has not been specifically studied in HIV-infected individuals. High vitamin E doses may exacerbate the blood coagulation defect of vitamin K deficiency caused by anticoagulant therapy or malabsorption.</p><h3>Patients with Hemophilia</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of spontaneous bleeding in patients with hemophilia A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients, additional factor VIII was required. In many of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or restarted. A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these episodes has not been established.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immune Reconstitution Syndrome:</span> Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including Agenerase. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium avium</span> infection, cytomegalovirus, <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span> pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.</p><h3>Fat Redistribution</h3><p class="First">Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and “cushingoid appearance,” have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.</p><h3>Lipid Elevations</h3><p class="First">Treatment with Agenerase alone or in combination with ritonavir has resulted in increases in the concentration of total cholesterol and triglycerides. Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior to initiation of therapy with Agenerase and at periodic intervals during treatment. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. See PRECAUTIONS Table 8: Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions for additional information on potential drug interactions with Agenerase and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.</p><h3>Resistance/Cross-Resistance</h3><p class="First">Because the potential for HIV cross-resistance among protease inhibitors has not been fully explored, it is unknown what effect amprenavir therapy will have on the activity of subsequently administered protease inhibitors. It is also unknown what effect previous treatment with other protease inhibitors will have on the activity of amprenavir (see MICROBIOLOGY).</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">A statement to patients and healthcare providers is included on the product’s bottle label: <span class="Bold">ALERT: Find out about medicines that should NOT be taken with Agenerase.</span> A Patient Package Insert (PPI) for Agenerase Capsules is available for patient information.</p><p>Patients treated with Agenerase Capsules should be cautioned against switching to <span class="Bold">Agenerase Oral Solution</span> because of the increased risk of adverse events from the large amount of propylene glycol in <span class="Bold">Agenerase Oral Solution</span>. Please see the complete prescribing information for <span class="Bold">Agenerase Oral Solution</span> for full information.</p><p>Patients should be informed that Agenerase is not a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications associated with HIV disease. The long-term effects of Agenerase (amprenavir) are unknown at this time. Patients should be told that there are currently no data demonstrating that therapy with Agenerase can reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact.</p><p>Patients should remain under the care of a physician while using Agenerase. Patients should be advised to take Agenerase every day as prescribed. Agenerase must always be used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Patients should not alter the dose or discontinue therapy without consulting their physician. If a dose is missed, patients should take the dose as soon as possible and then return to their normal schedule. However, if a dose is skipped, the patient should not double the next dose.</p><p>Patients should inform their doctor if they have a sulfa allergy.

Daily doses of 50, 275 to 300, and 500 to 600 mg/kg/day were administered to mice and doses of 50, 190, and 750 mg/kg/day were administered to rats. Results showed an increase in the incidence of benign hepatocellular adenomas and an increase in the combined incidence of hepatocellular adenomas plus carcinoma in males of both species at the highest doses tested. Female mice and rats were not affected. These observations were made at systemic exposures equivalent to approximately 2 times (mice) and 4 times (rats) the human exposure (based on AUC<span class="Sub">0-24 hr</span> measurement) at the recommended dose of 1,200 mg twice daily. Administration of amprenavir did not cause a statistically significant increase in the incidence of any other benign or malignant neoplasm in mice or rats. It is not known how predictive the results of rodent carcinogenicity studies may be for humans. However, amprenavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including bacterial reverse mutation (Ames), mouse lymphoma, rat micronucleus, and chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes.</p><h3>Fertility</h3><p class="First">: The effects of amprenavir on fertility and general reproductive performance were investigated in male rats (treated for 28 days before mating at doses producing up to twice the expected clinical exposure based on AUC comparisons) and female rats (treated for 15 days before mating through day 17 of gestation at doses producing up to 2 times the expected clinical exposure). Amprenavir did not impair mating or fertility of male or female rats and did not affect the development and maturation of sperm from treated rats. The reproductive performance of the F1 generation born to female rats given amprenavir was not different from control animals.</p><h3>Pregnancy and Reproduction</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C. Embryo/fetal development studies were conducted in rats (dosed from 15 days before pairing to day 17 of gestation) and rabbits (dosed from day 8 to day 20 of gestation). In pregnant rabbits, amprenavir administration was associated with abortions and an increased incidence of 3 minor skeletal variations resulting from deficient ossification of the femur, humerus trochlea, and humerus. Systemic exposure at the highest tested dose was approximately one twentieth of the exposure seen at the recommended human dose. In rat fetuses, thymic elongation and incomplete ossification of bones were attributed to amprenavir. Both findings were seen at systemic exposures that were one half of that associated with the recommended human dose.</p><p>Pre- and post-natal developmental studies were performed in rats dosed from day 7 of gestation to day 22 of lactation. Reduced body weights (10% to 20%) were observed in the offspring. The systemic exposure associated with this finding was approximately twice the exposure in humans following administration of the recommended human dose. The subsequent development of these offspring, including fertility and reproductive performance, was not affected by the maternal administration of amprenavir.</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Agenerase should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p><span class="Bold">Agenerase Oral Solution</span> is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the potential risk of toxicity to the fetus from the high propylene glycol content.</p><p class="First">To monitor maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to Agenerase, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 1-800-258-4263.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV.</span> Although it is not known if amprenavir is excreted in human milk, amprenavir is secreted into the milk of lactating rats. Because of both the potential for HIV transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, <span class="Bold">mothers should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving Agenerase.</span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Two hundred fifty-one patients aged 4 and above have received amprenavir as single or multiple doses in studies. An adverse event profile similar to that seen in adults was seen in pediatric patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Agenerase Capsules</span> have not been evaluated in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p><p><span class="Bold">Agenerase Oral Solution</span> is contraindicated in infants and children below the age of 4 years due to the potential risk of toxicity from the large amount of the excipient, propylene glycol. Please see the complete prescribing informationfor <span class="Bold">Agenerase Oral Solution</span> for full information.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Agenerase did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">In clinical studies, adverse events leading to amprenavir discontinuation occurred primarily during the first 12 weeks of therapy, and were mostly due to gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain/discomfort), which were mild to moderate in severity.</p><p>Skin rash occurred in 22% of patients treated with amprenavir in studies PROAB3001 and PROAB3006. Rashes were usually maculopapular and of mild or moderate intensity, some with pruritus. Rashes had a median onset of 11 days after amprenavir initiation and a median duration of 10 days. Skin rashes led to amprenavir discontinuation in approximately 3% of patients. In some patients with mild or moderate rash, amprenavir dosing was often continued without interruption; if interrupted, reintroduction of amprenavir generally did not result in rash recurrence.</p><p><span class="Bold">Severe or life-threatening rash (Grade 3 or 4), including cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, occurred in approximately 1% of recipients of Agenerase (see WARNINGS). Amprenavir therapy should be discontinued for severe or life-threatening rashes and for moderate rashes accompanied by systemic symptoms.</span></p><p class="First">Adverse Event</p><p class="First">PROAB3001</p><p>Therapy-Naive Patients</p><p class="First">PROAB3006</p><p>NRTI-Experienced Patients</p><p class="First">Agenerase/Lamivudine/</p><p>Zidovudine</p><p>(n = 113)</p><p class="First">Lamivudine/</p><p>Zidovudine</p><p>(n = 109)</p><p class="First">Agenerase/NRTI</p><p>(n = 245)</p><p class="First">Indinavir/</p><p>NRTI</p><p>(n = 241)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Digestive</span></p><p class="First">Nausea</p><p class="First">74%</p><p class="First">50%</p><p class="First">43%</p><p class="First">35%</p><p class="First">Vomiting</p><p class="First">34%</p><p class="First">17%</p><p class="First">24%</p><p class="First">20%</p><p class="First">Diarrhea or loose stools</p><p class="First">39%</p><p class="First">35%</p><p class="First">60%</p><p class="First">41%</p><p class="First">Taste disorders</p><p class="First">10%</p><p class="First">6%</p><p class="First">2%</p><p class="First">8%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Skin</span></p><p class="First">Rash</p><p class="First">27%</p><p class="First">6%</p><p class="First">20%</p><p class="First">15%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nervous</span></p><p class="First">Paresthesia, oral/perioral</p><p class="First">26%</p><p class="First">6%</p><p class="First">31%</p><p class="First">2%</p><p class="First">Paresthesia, peripheral</p><p class="First">10%</p><p class="First">4%</p><p class="First">14%</p><p class="First">10%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Psychiatric</span></p><p class="First">Depressive or mood disorders</p><p class="First">16%</p><p class="First">4%</p><p class="First">9%</p><p class="First">13%</p><p>Among amprenavir-treated patients in Phase 3 studies, 2 patients developed de novo diabetes mellitus, 1 patient developed a dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), and 9 patients developed fat redistribution.</p><p>In studies PROAB3001 and PROAB3006, no increased frequency of Grade 3 or 4 AST, ALT, amylase, or bilirubin elevations was seen compared to controls.</p><h3>Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">An adverse event profile similar to that seen in adults was seen in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Concomitant Therapy with Ritonavir</h3><p class="First">Tables 10 and 11 present adverse clinical events and laboratory abnormalities observed in subjects who received Agenerase plus ritonavir.

HIV is the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome.) Agenerase belongs to a class of anti-HIV medicines called protease inhibitors.</p><p>Agenerase is used only in combination with other anti-HIV medicines. When used in combination therapy, Agenerase may help lower the amount of HIV found in your blood, raise CD4 (T) cell counts, and keep your immune system as healthy as possible, so it can help fight infection. However, Agenerase does not have these effects in all patients.</p><p>Agenerase does not cure HIV infection or AIDS. We do not know if Agenerase will help you live longer or have fewer of the medical problems (opportunistic infections) that people get with HIV or AIDS.
