Appropriate management of therapy and complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available.</p><p>Bone marrow suppression, notably thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, which may contribute to overwhelming infections in an already compromised patient, is the most common and severe of the toxic effects of mitomycin.</p><p>Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a serious complication of chemotherapy, consisting primarily of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and irreversible renal failure has been reported in patients receiving systemic mitomycin. The syndrome may occur at any time during systemic therapy with mitomycin as a single agent or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs; however, most cases occur at doses greater than or equal to 60 mg of mitomycin. Blood product transfusion may exacerbate the symptoms associated with this syndrome. The incidence of the syndrome has not been defined.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Bladder fibrosis/contraction: Bladder fibrosis/contraction has been reported with intravesical administration (unlabeled administration route).</p><p>• Bone marrow suppression: <b> [US Boxed Warning]: Bone marrow suppression (thrombocytopenia and leukopenia) is common and may be severe and/or contribute to infections.</b> WBC and platelet nadir usually occurs at 4 weeks, although may occur at up to 8 weeks; recovery occurs within 10 weeks. Fatalities due to sepsis have been reported; monitor for infections. Myelosuppression is dose-limiting, delayed in onset, and cumulative; therefore, monitor blood counts closely during and for at least 8 weeks following treatment; treatment delay or dosage adjustment may be required for significant thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>) or leukopenia (WBC&lt;4,000/mm<sup>3</sup>) or a progressive decline in either value.</p><p>• Extravasation: Mitomycin is a potent vesicant; ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during infusion. Avoid extravasation. May cause necrosis and tissue sloughing; delayed erythema and/or ulceration have been reported.</p><p>• Heart failure: In a scientific statement from the American Heart Association, mitomycin has been determined to be an agent that may either cause reversible direct myocardial toxicity or exacerbate underlying myocardial dysfunction (magnitude: moderate) (AHA [Page 2016]).</p><p>• Hemolytic-uremic syndrome: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) has been reported (incidence not defined); condition usually involves microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (hematocrit ≤25%), thrombocytopenia (≤100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>), and irreversible renal failure (serum creatinine ≥1.6 mg/dL). HUS may occur at any time (either with single agent or combination therapy), is generally associated with single doses ≥60 mg, and HUS symptoms may be exacerbated by blood transfusion. </b>Other less common effects may include pulmonary edema, neurologic abnormalities, and hypertension. A high mortality from HUS has been reported.</p><p>• Pulmonary toxicity: Cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been reported in patients receiving mitomycin in combination with other chemotherapy who were maintained at FIO<sub>2</sub> concentrations &gt;50% perioperatively; use caution to provide only enough oxygen to maintain adequate arterial saturation and avoid overhydration. Pulmonary toxicity has also been reported as dyspnea with nonproductive cough and appearance of pulmonary infiltrates on radiograph; discontinue therapy if pulmonary toxicity occurs and other potential etiologies have been ruled out.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Renal impairment: Do not administer if serum creatinine is &gt;1.7 mg/dL; monitor for renal toxicity.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Vinca alkaloids: Shortness of breath and bronchospasm have been reported in patients receiving vinca alkaloids in combination with mitomycin or who received mitomycin previously; this acute respiratory distress has occurred within minutes to hours following the vinca alkaloid; may be managed with bronchodilators, steroids and/or oxygen.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Experienced physician: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Should be administered under the supervision of an experienced cancer chemotherapy physician.</b></p><p>• Product selection: Mitomycin is available as mitomycin for injection, mitomycin (ophthalmic), and mitomycin (ureteral gel); the products are different and are <b>NOT</b> interchangeable.
