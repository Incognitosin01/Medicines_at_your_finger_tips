</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOR IV USE AFTER DILUTION</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Rx Only</span></p><h2>Multitrace-5 Concentrate Description</h2><p class="First">MULTITRACE<span class="Sup">®</span>- 5 CONCENTRATE (TRACE ELEMENTS INJECTION 5, USP) is a sterile nonpyrogenic <span class="Bold">CONCENTRATED</span> solution containing five Trace Elements for use as an additive for Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN).</p><p>Each mL Contains: Zinc Sulfate Heptahydrate 22 mg (equivalent to 5 mg Zinc); Cupric Sulfate Pentahydrate 3.93 mg (equivalent to 1 mg Copper); Manganese Sulfate Monohydrate 1.54 mg (equivalent to 0.5 mg Manganese); Chromic Chloride Hexahydrate 51.3 mcg (equivalent to 10 mcg Chromium); Selenious Acid 98 mcg (equivalent to 60 mcg Selenium); and Water for Injection q.s. pH of the solution may have been adjusted with Sulfuric Acid. The 10 mL Multiple Dose Vial contains 0.9% Benzyl Alcohol as an antimicrobial preservative.</p><h2>Multitrace-5 Concentrate - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ZINC</span> has been identified as a cofactor for over 70 different enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase and both RNA and DNA polymerase. Zinc facilitates wound healing, helps maintain normal growth rates, normal skin hydration and senses of taste and smell.</p><p>Providing zinc during TPN prevents development of the following deficiency symptoms: Parakeratosis, hypogeusia, anorexia, dysosmia, geophagia, hypogonadism, growth retardation and hepatosplenomegaly. At plasma levels below 20 mcg zinc/100 mL, dermatitis followed by alopecia has been reported for TPN patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">COPPER</span> is essential as a cofactor for serum ceruloplasmin, an oxidase necessary for proper formation of the iron carrier protein, transferrin. Copper also helps maintain normal rates of red and white blood cell formation. Scorbutic type bone changes seen in infants fed exclusively with copper-poor cow's milk are believed due to decreased activity of ascorbate oxidase, a cuproenzyme.</p><p>Providing copper during TPN prevents development of the following deficiency symptoms: leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, depressed ceruloplasmin levels, impaired transferrin formation and secondary iron deficiency.</p><p><span class="Bold">MANGANESE</span> is an activator for enzymes such as polysaccharide polymerase, liver arginase, cholinesterase and pyruvate carboxylase.</p><p>Providing manganese during TPN prevents development of the following deficiency symptoms: nausea and vomiting, weight loss, dermatitis, and changes in growth and color of hair.</p><p><span class="Bold">CHROMIUM</span> (trivalent) is part of glucose tolerance factor, an activator of insulin-mediated reactions. Chromium helps to maintain normal glucose metabolism and peripheral nerve function.</p><p>Providing chromium during TPN prevents development of the following deficiency symptoms: impaired glucose tolerance, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and a confusional state similar to mild/moderate hepatic encephalopathy.</p><p><span class="Bold">SELENIUM</span> is part of glutathione peroxidase which protects cell components from oxidative damage due to peroxides produced in cellular metabolism.</p><p>Prolonged TPN support in humans has resulted in selenium deficiency symptoms which include muscle pain and tenderness. The symptoms have been reported to respond to supplementation of TPN solutions with selenium.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Multitrace-5 Concentrate</h2><p class="First">This formulation is indicated for use as a supplement to intravenous solutions given for TPN. Administration of the solution in TPN solutions helps to maintain plasma levels of zinc, copper, manganese, selenium and chromium and to prevent depletion of endogenous stores of these trace elements and subsequent deficiency symptoms.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">MULTITRACE<span class="Sup">®</span>- 5 <span class="Bold">CONCENTRATE</span> should not be given undiluted by direct injection into a peripheral vein because of the potential of infusion phlebitis.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Copper and Manganese are eliminated via the bile. In patients with severe liver dysfunction and/or biliary tract obstruction, decreasing or omitting copper and manganese supplements entirely may be necessary.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Before administering MULTITRACE<span class="Sup">®</span>- 5 <span class="Bold">CONCENTRATE</span> in TPN solutions, the physician must assess the metabolic requirements for trace elements and disease state of the patient. Frequent determinations of serum levels of the various trace elements are suggested as a guideline for adjusting the dosage or completely omitting the solution. <span class="Bold">ZINC</span> is eliminated via the intestine and kidneys. The possibility of retention should be considered in patients with malfunctioning excretory routes. <span class="Bold">COPPER</span> and <span class="Bold">MANGANESE</span> are eliminated via the bile, therefore the possibility of retention of these elements should be considered in patients with biliary obstruction. Ancillary routes of MANGANESE excretion, however, include pancreatic juice, or reabsorption into the lumen of duodenum, jejunum, or ileum.</p><p>In assessing the contribution of <span class="Bold">CHROMIUM</span> supplements to maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis, consideration should be given to the possibility that the patient may be diabetic, in which case oral or intravenous antidiabetic medication may be indicated.</p><p>As <span class="Bold">SELENIUM</span> is eliminated in urine and feces, <span class="Bold">SELENIUM</span> supplements may be adjusted, reduced or omitted in renal dysfunction and/or gastrointestinal malfunction. In patients receiving blood transfusions, contribution from such transfusions should also be considered. Frequent selenium plasma level determinations are suggested as a guideline.</p><p>In animals, <span class="Bold">SELENIUM</span> has been reported to enhance the action of Vitamin E and decrease the toxicity of mercury, cadmium, and arsenic.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C: <span class="Bold">SELENIUM</span> at high dose levels (15-30 mcg/egg) has been reported to have adverse embryological effects among chickens. There are however no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. MULTITRACE<span class="Sup">®</span>- 5 <span class="Bold">CONCENTRATE</span> should be used during pregnancy only if potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>Presence of <span class="Bold">SELENIUM</span> in placenta and umbilical cord blood has been reported in humans.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The amounts of <span class="Bold">ZINC, COPPER, MANGANESE, CHROMIUM</span> and <span class="Bold">SELENIUM</span> in the solution are very small and toxicity symptoms due to these trace elements at suggested dosage levels are considered unlikely to occur.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Symptoms of <span class="Bold">ZINC</span> overdosage resulting from oral ingestion of Zinc Sulfate in large amounts have resulted in death. Symptoms included nausea, vomiting, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, dizziness, abdominal pain, lethargy and incoordination. Single intravenous doses of 1 to 2 mg zinc/kg bodyweight have been given to adult leukemic patients without toxic manifestations. Normal plasma levels for Zinc vary from approximately 88 to 112 mcg/100 mL. Plasma levels sufficient to produce symptoms of toxic manifestations are not known. Calcium supplements may confer a protective effect against Zinc toxicity.</p><p>Symptoms of <span class="Bold">COPPER</span> toxicity reported in literature include prostration, behavior change, diarrhea, progressive marasmus, hypotonia, photophobia and peripheral edema. D-penicillamine has been reported effective as an antidote.</p><p><span class="Bold">MANGANESE</span> toxicity has not been reported in patients receiving TPN. Neither have reports of manganese toxicity from excessive intake in foods and/or beverages been published.</p><p>Symptoms of <span class="Bold">CHROMIUM</span> toxicity include nausea, vomiting, ulcers of gastrointestinal tract, renal and hepatic damage, and abnormalities of the central nervous system culminating in convulsions and coma. Trivalent Chromium administered intravenously to TPN patients has been shown to be nontoxic when given at dosage levels up to 250 mcg/day for two consecutive weeks.</p><p>Chronic toxicity in humans resulting from exposure to <span class="Bold">SELENIUM</span> in industrial environments, intake of foods grown in seleniferous soils, use of selenium contaminated water, and application of cosmetics containing selenium has been reported in literature. Toxicity symptoms include hair loss, weakened nails, dermatitis, dental defects, gastrointestinal disorders, nervousness, mental depression, metallic taste, vomiting, and garlic odor of breath and sweat. Acute poisoning due to ingestion of large amounts of selenium compounds has resulted in death with histopathological changes including fulminating peripheral vascular collapse, internal vascular congestion, diffusely hemorrhagic, congested and edematous lungs, brick-red color gastric mucosa. The death was preceded by coma. No effective antidote to selenium poisoning in humans is known. Animal studies have shown casein and linseed oil in feeds, reduced glutathione, arsenic, magnesium sulfate, and bromobenzene to afford limited protection.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">Each mL of the solution provides Zinc 5 mg, Copper 1 mg, Manganese 0.5 mg, Chromium 10 mcg, and Selenium 60 mcg. The suggested dosage ranges for the five trace elements are:</p><p><span class="Bold">ZINC</span><span class="Bold">:</span> For the metabolically stable adult receiving TPN, the suggested intravenous dosage level is 2.5 to 4 mg zinc/day. An additional 2 mg zinc/day is suggested for acute catabolic states. For the stable adult with fluid loss from the small bowel, an additional 12.2 mg zinc/liter of small bowel fluid lost, or an additional 17.1 mg zinc/kg of stool or ileostomy output is recommended. Frequent monitoring of zinc blood levels is suggested for patients receiving more than the usual maintenance dosage level of zinc. Normal plasma levels for zinc vary from approximately 88 to 112 mcg/100 mL.</p><p>For full term infants and children up to 5 years of age, 100 mcg zinc/kg/day is recommended. For premature infants (birth weight less than 1500 g) up to 3 kg in body weight, 300 mcg zinc/kg/day is suggested.</p><p><span class="Bold">COPPER</span><span class="Bold">:</span> For the metabolically stable adult receiving TPN, the suggested additive dosage level is 0.5 to 1.5 mg copper/day. For pediatric patients, the suggested additive dosage level is 20 mcg copper/kg/day. The normal plasma range for copper is approximately 80 to 160 mcg/100 mL.</p><p><span class="Bold">MANGANESE</span><span class="Bold">:</span> For the metabolically stable adult receiving TPN, the suggested additive dosage level for manganese is 0.15 mg to 0.8 mg/day. For pediatric patients, a dosage level of 2 to 10 mcg manganese/kg/day is recommended.</p><p><span class="Bold">CHROMIUM</span><span class="Bold">:</span> For the metabolically stable adult receiving TPN, the suggested additive dosage level is 10 to 15 mcg chromium/day. The metabolically stable adult with intestinal fluid loss may require 20 mcg chromium/day, with frequent monitoring of blood levels as a guideline for subsequent administration. For pediatric patients, the suggested additive dosage level is 0.14 to 0.20 mcg/kg/day.</p><p><span class="Bold">SELENIUM</span><span class="Bold">:</span> For metabolically stable adults receiving TPN, the suggested additive dosage level is 20 to 40 mcg selenium/day. For pediatric patients, the suggested additive dosage level is 3 mcg/kg/day.</p><p>In adults, selenium deficiency states resulting from long term TPN support, selenium as selenomethionine or selenious acid, administered intravenously at 100 mcg/day for a period of 24 and 31 days, respectively, has been reported to reverse deficiency symptoms without toxicity. The normal whole blood range for selenium is approximately 10 to 37 mcg/100 mL.</p><p>Periodic monitoring of plasma levels of Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Chromium and Selenium is suggested as a guideline for administration.<br/></p><p>Aseptic addition of <span class="Bold">MULTITRACE<span class="Sup">®</span> - 5 CONCENTRATE</span> to parenteral nutrition solutions under laminar flow hood is recommended. The trace elements present in <span class="Bold">MULTITRACE<span class="Sup">®</span> - 5 CONCENTRATE</span> are physically compatible with the electrolytes and vitamins usually present in parenteral nutrition formulations.</p><p>Do not directly mix ascorbic acid injection with copper or selenium containing parenteral products in the same syringe or vial, as this admixture may cause the formation of an insoluble precipitate.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p><p>Store at 20°-25°C (68°-77°F); excursions permitted to 15°-30°C (59°-86°F) (See USP Controlled Room Temperature).</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED</h2><p class="First">MULTITRACE<span class="Sup">®</span>- 5 <span class="Bold">CONCENTRATE</span> (TRACE ELEMENTS INJECTION 5, USP)</p><p>Each mL provides: Zinc 5 mg, Copper 1 mg, Manganese 0.5 mg, Chromium 10 mcg, Selenium 60 mcg.</p><p>NDC 0517-8201-25                        1 mL Single Dose Vial                       Packaged in boxes of 25</p><p>NDC 0517-8210-25                        10 mL Multiple Dose Vial*                Packaged in boxes of 25</p><p>*The 10 mL multiple dose vial contains 0.9% benzyl alcohol as an antimicrobial preservative.</p><p><span class="Bold">AMERICAN<br/></span> <span class="Bold">REGENT, INC.<br/></span> <span class="Bold">SHIRLEY, NY 11967</span></p><p>IN8201<br/>
