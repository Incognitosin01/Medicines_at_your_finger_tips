Both eye conditions are caused by high pressure in your eye and can lead to pain from pressure in your eye and then can eventually harm your vision. This medicine can help you keep your sight by reducing the pressure in your eye and stopping eye pain.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Azopt 1%</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of brinzolamide eye drops in the elderly.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.

Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Azopt 1%</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain brinzolamide.  It may not be specific to Azopt 1%. Please read with care.</b></p><p>Your eye doctor will tell you how much of this medicine to use and how often. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.</p><p>If you normally wear soft contact lenses, remove them before you use brinzolamide eye drops. Wait at least 15 minutes before putting the contact lenses back in.</p><p>To use the eye drops:</p><ul>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water.</li>
<li>Shake the eye drops well just before each use.</li>
<li>Lie down or tilt your head back. With your index finger, pull down the lower lid of your eye to form a pocket.</li>
<li>Hold the dropper close to your eye with the other hand. Drop the correct number of drops into the pocket made between your lower lid and eyeball.</li>
<li>Gently close your eyes. Place your index finger over the inner corner of your eye for 1 minute.</li>
<li>If you think you did not get the drop of medicine into your eye properly, repeat the process with another drop.</li>
<li>Do not rinse or wipe the dropper or allow it to touch anything, including your eye.</li>
<li>Put the cap on the bottle right away.</li>
<li>Wash your hands after using the eye drops to remove any medicine.</li>
<li>Never touch the applicator tip to any surface, including the eye, and keep the container tightly closed. This will keep the medicine as germ-free as possible.</li>
</ul><p>If your doctor ordered two different eye drops to be used together, wait at least 10 minutes between the times you apply the medicines. This will help to keep the second medicine from “washing out” the first one.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine.
