Prevnar 13 contains 13 different types of pneumococcal bacteria.</p><p>Pneumococcal disease is a serious infection caused by a bacteria. Pneumococcal bacteria can infect the sinuses and inner ear. It can also infect the lungs, blood, and brain, and these conditions can be fatal.</p><p>Prevnar 13 works by exposing you to a small amount of the bacteria or a protein from the bacteria, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. Prevnar 13 will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>Prevnar 13 is for use in children from 6 weeks to 5 years old, and in adults who are 50 and older.</p><p>Update: Pfizer Receives FDA Approval for Prevnar 13 in Adults Age 18 Through 49 July 12, 2016</p><p>Becoming infected with pneumococcal disease (such as pneumonia or meningitis) is much more dangerous to your health than receiving Prevnar 13.

Adults usually receive only one dose of the vaccine.</p><p>In a child older than 6 months who has not yet received Prevnar 13, the first dose can be given any time from the age of 7 months through 5 years (before the 6th birthday).</p><p>If the child is less than 1 year old at the time of the first Prevnar 13 shot, he or she will need 2 booster doses. If the child is 12 to 23 months old at the time of the first shot, he or she will need 1 booster dose.
