Lybrel also causes changes in your cervical mucus and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus.</p><p>Lybrel is used as contraception to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>Lybrel may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Do not use Lybrel if you are pregnant or if you have recently had a baby.

Do not Lybrel use if you are breast feeding a baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take Lybrel?</h2><p>Take Lybrel exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label. Your pill pack contains 28 pills with active medication.</p><p>You will take your first Lybrel pill on the first day of your period. If your doctor directs you to start this medication on any other day, use an additional form of non-hormonal birth control (such as condoms, spermicide) for the first 7 days to prevent pregnancy until this medication has enough time to work. If you start on the first day of your period, you do not need to use back-up birth control the first week. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Take one pill every day, no more than 24 hours apart. When the pills run out, start a new pack the following day. There is no break between packs, and there are no reminder tablets. You may get pregnant if you do not take one pill daily. Get your prescription refilled before you run out of pills completely.</p><p>You may have breakthrough bleeding, especially during the first 3 months. Tell your doctor if this bleeding continues or is very heavy.</p><p>Use a back-up birth control if you are sick with severe vomiting or diarrhea.</p><p>If you need surgery or medical tests or if you will be on bed rest, you may need to stop using Lybrel for a short time. Any doctor or surgeon who treats you should know that you are using Lybrel.</p><p>While taking Lybrel, you will need to visit your doctor regularly.</p><p>Store Lybrel at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Follow the patient instructions provided in your Lybrel packet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions. Missing a pill increases your risk of becoming pregnant.</p><p><b>If you miss one Lybrel pill:</b></p><ul>
