It works by reversibly blocking the action of a chemical substance known as monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) in the nervous system.</p><p>Although moclobemide is very effective for certain patients, it may also cause some unwanted reactions if taken the wrong way. It is very important to avoid certain beverages and medicines while you are using moclobemide. Your doctor may provide a list as a reminder of which products you should avoid.</p><p>Moclobemide is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using moclobemide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For moclobemide, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to moclobemide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Studies on moclobemide have been done only in adult patients, and there is no specific information comparing use of moclobemide in children with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Older adults are especially sensitive to the effects of moclobemide. This may increase the chance of side effects during treatment. Dizziness or lightheadedness may be especially likely to occur in elderly patients, who are usually more sensitive than younger adults to these effects.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking moclobemide, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using moclobemide with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h3>Interactions with food and alcohol</h3><p>Unlike monoamine oxidase inhibitors, special dietary restrictions are not generally required while you are taking moclobemide. Some people taking moclobemide may be hypersensitive to tyramine and should avoid eating foods that are high in tyramine such as aged cheeses, cured meats, broad bean pods, yeast-extract spreads and soy products. Tyramine hypersensitivity reactions may be minimized by taking moclobemide immediately after meals.</p><p>Do not drink excessive amounts of alcohol while you are taking moclobemide.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of moclobemide. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Hypertension—May make this condition worse.</li>
<li>Liver disease—Effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of moclobemide</h2><ul>
<li>Ask your doctor about any changes you should make to your diet.</li>
<li>Do not drink excessive amounts of alcohol while you are taking moclobemide.</li>
</ul><p>Sometimes moclobemide must be taken for several weeks before you begin to feel better. Your doctor should check your progress at regular visits, especially during the first few months of treatment, to make sure that moclobemide is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Take moclobemide only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.</p><p>Moclobemide should be taken after a meal. However, if your doctor tells you to take the medicine a certain way, take it exactly as directed.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of moclobemide will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of moclobemide. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.

To avoid such reactions, follow these rules of caution:</p><ul>
<li>Do not drink excessive amounts of alcohol.</li>
<li>Do not take any other medicine unless approved or prescribed by your doctor. This especially includes nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine, such as medicine for colds (including nose drops or sprays), cough, hay fever, and appetite control; "stay awake" products; or products that make you sleepy.</li>
</ul><p>Check with your doctor immediately if you experience any combination of the following symptoms: severe, throbbing headache that starts at the back of the head and radiates forward; stiff neck; fast or racing heartbeat; pounding, irregular, or slow heartbeat. These may be symptoms of a serious side effect that should have a doctor's attention.</p><p>Do not stop taking moclobemide without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely.</p><p>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position suddenly. Getting up slowly may help. When you get up from lying down, sit on the edge of the bed with your feet dangling for 1 or 2 minutes, then stand up slowly. If the problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.</p><p>Moclobemide may cause blurred vision or make some people drowsy or less alert than they are normally. Make sure you know how you react to moclobemide before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are unable to see well or are not alert.</p><p>Before having any kind of surgery, dental treatment, or emergency treatment, tell the medical doctor or dentist in charge that you are using moclobemide or have used it within the past 2 weeks. Taking moclobemide together with medicines that are used during surgery, dental, or emergency treatments may increase the risk of serious side effects.</p><p>After you stop using moclobemide, you must continue to exercise caution for at least 2 weeks with your foods, drinks, and other medicines, since these items may continue to react with moclobemide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Moclobemide side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
