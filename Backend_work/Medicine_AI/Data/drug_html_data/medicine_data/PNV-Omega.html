Each softgel is green in color, opaque and imprinted with “332” on one side.</p><p></p><h3>OTHER INGREDIENTS</h3><p class="First">Gelatin capsule (bovine gelatin, glycerin, purified water, titanium dioxide, FD&amp;C Yellow #5, FD&amp;C Blue #1, and FD&amp;C Yellow #6), soy lecithin, vegetable shortening, and yellow beeswax. Contains soy.
