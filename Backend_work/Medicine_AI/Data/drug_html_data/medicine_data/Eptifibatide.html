An unwanted blood clot can occur with certain heart or blood vessel conditions.</p><p>Eptifibatide is used to prevent blood clots or heart attack in people with severe chest pain or other conditions, and in those who are undergoing a procedure called angioplasty (to open blocked arteries).</p><p>Eptifibatide may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive eptifibatide if you are also being treated with similar medications such as abciximab (ReoPro) or tirofiban (Aggrastat).</p><p>You should not receive eptifibatide if: you have severe or uncontrolled high blood pressure; you are on dialysis due to kidney failure; you have a bleeding or blood-clotting disorder; you had a stroke or any type of bleeding within the past 30 days; or you had any type of surgery, injury, or medical emergency within the past 6 weeks.</p><p><b>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment with eptifibatide and aspirin.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use eptifibatide if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p><ul>

However, <b>aspirin is sometimes given with eptifibatide, and aspirin can cause bleeding when it is taken during the last 3 months of pregnancy. Aspirin can also cause side effects in a newborn baby.</b> Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment.</p><p>It is not known whether eptifibatide passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is eptifibatide given?</h2><p>Eptifibatide is injected into a vein through an IV. A healthcare provider will give you  eptifibatide. Eptifibatide is sometimes given around the clock for up to 4 days in a row.</p><p>If you are receiving this injection during an angioplasty procedure, the medicine will be given throughout the entire procedure and for up to 24 hours after the procedure.</p><p>Eptifibatide is sometimes given together with aspirin. Follow your doctor's instructions about how much aspirin to take and for how long.</p><p>To be sure this medicine is helping your condition and is not causing harmful effects, your blood will need to be tested often.</p><p>Because eptifibatide keeps your blood from coagulating (clotting), this medicine can also make it easier for you to bleed, even from a minor injury. Contact your doctor or seek emergency medical attention if you have any bleeding that will not stop.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since eptifibatide is given by a healthcare professional, you are not likely to miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while receiving eptifibatide?</h2><p>Avoid activities that may increase your risk of bleeding or injury.
