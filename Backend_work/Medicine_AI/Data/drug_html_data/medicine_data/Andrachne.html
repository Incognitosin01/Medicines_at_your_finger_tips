A. cordifolia was shown to be phytotoxic in a study in Pakistan.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Euphorbiaceae (spurges)</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>Nomenclature used in literature lacks clarity, and the terms Andrachne and Leptopus are used inconsistently. Geographically, the plants are distinct, with Andrachne found in the Western Hemisphere, Africa, parts of the Arabian Peninsula, the Mediterranean region, and the Asia Minor peninsula, and Leptopus found in Australia, the biogeographical region of Malesia, and China. However, both genera are found in the Caucasus region, Pakistan, and India. The traditional classification of Andrachne has been reconsidered based on recent DNA sequence data.Vorontsova 2007</p><p>There are 8 morphologically distinct generic groups, including Andrachne <i>sensu stricto</i>, the Andrachne section Phyllanthopsis (eg, Leptopus phyllanthoides, Andrachne arida), the Andrachne section Pseudophyllanthus (eg, Andrachne ovalis), and Leptopus <i>s.s.</i>USDA 2014, Vorontsova 2007 Synonyms include Leptopus cordifolius, and L. phyllanthoides.</p><p>Andrachne species are shrubs and undershrubs that grow in tropical and warm regions. The plants possess many ascending leafy branches with leaves that are oval or obovate, while the flowers are monoecious, pedicellate, and usually solitary in the axils. The fruit is dry, splitting into three 2-valved carpels.Fernald 1950</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>There is limited information on the chemical constituents of Andrachne. Two bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, cocsuline and pendulin, have been isolated from the roots of A. cordifolia.Khan 1983 Whole plant extract of A. cordifolia taken from the Himalayas revealed the presence of pentacyclic triterpenes.Mukherjee 1986</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Antimicrobial effects</h3><p>A. cordifolia was shown to possess phytotoxic properties in an in vitro study in Pakistan.Gilani 2010</p><p>A. aspera roots are used for treating eye inflammation in Yemen, where pieces of crushed root are placed on the eyelids. Activity against human pathogens has been evaluated in vitro, with low activity demonstrated by methanolic fractions. A chloroform fraction was active against Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Some activity against fungi was demonstrated; however, clinical studies are lacking.Ahmad 2007, Ghazanfur 1994</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>There is no clinical evidence to support Andrachne dosage.</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use.
