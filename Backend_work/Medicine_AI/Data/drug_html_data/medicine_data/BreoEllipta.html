Fluticasone is a steroid that prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation. Vilanterol is a bronchodilator that works by relaxing muscles in the airways to improve breathing.</p><p>Breo Ellipta is a once-daily combination medicine used in adults with asthma or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), to improve symptoms and prevent bronchospasm or asthma attacks.</p><p>In people with COPD, Breo Ellipta is for long-term treatment. In people with asthma, this medicine is for short-term treatment until symptoms are well-controlled with with other medicines.</p><p>Vilanterol when used alone may increase the risk of death in people with asthma. However, this risk is not increased when fluticasone and vilanterol are used together as a combination product.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Breo Ellipta is not a rescue medicine. It will not work fast enough to treat an asthma or bronchospasm attack.</p><p>Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Breo Ellipta may interact with other medicines and this may cause serious side effects. Tell your healthcare provider if you take antifungal or anti-HIV medicines.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Breo Ellipta if you are allergic to fluticasone, vilanterol, or milk proteins.</p><p>Fluticasone can weaken your immune system, making it easier for you to get an infection or worsening an infection you already have or have recently had. Tell your doctor about any illness or infection you have had within the past several weeks.</p><p>To make sure Breo Ellipta is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
