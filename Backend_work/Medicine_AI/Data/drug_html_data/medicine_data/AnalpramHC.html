</ul><h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2><p class="First">Analpram HC<span class="Sup">®</span> Lotion 2.5% is a topical preparation containing hydrocortisone acetate 2.5% w/w and pramoxine hydrochloride 1% w/w in a hydroliphic lotion base containing stearic acid, cetyl alcohol, FORLAN-L (Contains: petrolatum, lanolin, hydrogenated coconut oil, sorbitan sesquioleate, stearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol), glycerin, trolamine, polyoxyl 40 stearate, di-isopropyl adipate, povidone, dimethicone, potassium sorbate, sorbic acid, and purified water.</p><p>Topical corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic agents.  The structural formula, the chemical name, molecular formula and molecular weight for active ingredients are presented as follows:</p><p></p><p>hydrocortisone acetate<br/>

Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man.</p><p>Pramoxine hydrochloride is a topical anesthetic agent which provides temporary relief from itching and pain. It acts by stabilizing the neuronal membrane of nerve endings with which it comes into contact.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics:</h3><p class="First">The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings.</p><p>Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. (See DOSAGE ANDADMINISTRATION.)</p><p>Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.</p><p>Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First">Topical corticosteroids are indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the preparation.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><h3>General:</h3><p class="First">Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestation of Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.</p><p>Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area and under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.</p><p>Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amount of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity. (See PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric Use.)</p><p>If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><p>In the presence of dermatological infection, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroids should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.</p><h3>Information for the Patient:</h3><p class="First">Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:</p><h3>Laboratory Tests:</h3><p class="First">The following tests may be helpful in evaluating the HPA axis suppression:</p><p>Urinary free cortisol test</p><p>ACTH stimulation test</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility:</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids. Studies to determine mutagenicity with prednisolone and hydrocortisone have revealed negative results.</p><h3>Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C:</h3><p class="First">Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers:</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to product detectable amounts in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities NOT likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids re administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use:</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid induced HPA axis suppression and Cushing’s syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight ratio.</span></p><p>Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing’s syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema.</p><p>Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroids therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">The following local adverse reactions are reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids, but may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressing. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First">Topically applied corticosteroids can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to product systemic effects. (See PRECAUTIONS)</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First">Topical corticosteroids are generally applied to the affected area as a thin film three to four times daily depending on the severity of the condition.  Lotion should be shaken well before use. Occlusive dressings may be used for the management of psoriasis or recalcitrant conditions. If an infection develops, the use of occlusive dressings should be discontinued and appropriate antimicrobial therapy instituted.</p><p>For cleansing the anogenital area, apply with a tissue or cotton ball.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED:</h2><p class="First">Analpram HC® Lotion 2.5% 2 fl oz (NDC 0496-0829-04)</p><p>R<span class="Sub">x</span> Only.</p><p>Manufactured for Ferndale Healthcare Inc.</p><p>By Ferndale Laboratories, Inc.
