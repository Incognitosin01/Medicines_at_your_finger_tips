</ul><h2>Norethindrone Acetate Description</h2><p class="First">Norethindrone Acetate tablets, USP - 5 mg oral tablets.</p><p>Norethindrone Acetate, USP (17-hydroxy-19-nor-17α-pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one acetate), a synthetic, orally active progestin, is the acetic acid ester of norethindrone. It is a white to yellowish-white, crystalline powder.</p><p></p><p>Norethindrone Acetate tablets, USP contain the following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose.</p><p>Meets USP dissolution Test 2.</p><h2>Norethindrone Acetate - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Norethindrone Acetate induces secretory changes in an estrogen-primed endometrium. On a weight basis, it is twice as potent as norethindrone.</p><h3>PHARMACOKINETICS</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption:</span></p><p>Norethindrone Acetate is completely and rapidly deacetylated to norethindrone (NET) after oral administration, and the disposition of Norethindrone Acetate is indistinguishable from that of orally administered norethindrone. Norethindrone Acetate is rapidly absorbed from Norethindrone Acetate tablets, with maximum plasma concentration of norethindrone generally occurring at about 2 hours post-dose. The pharmacokinetic parameters of norethindrone following single oral administration of Norethindrone Acetate tablets in 29 healthy female volunteers are summarized in Table 1.</p><p>Figure 1. Mean Plasma Concentration Profile after a Single Dose of 5 mg Administered to 29 Healthy Female Volunteers under Fasting Conditions</p><p><span class="Italics"></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Food:</span></p><p>The effect of food administration on the pharmacokinetics of Norethindrone Acetate tablets has not been studied.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution:</span></p><p>Norethindrone is 36% bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and 61% bound to albumin. Volume of distribution of norethindrone is about 4 L/kg.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism:</span></p><p>Norethindrone undergoes extensive biotransformation, primarily via reduction, followed by sulfate and glucuronide conjugation. The majority of metabolites in the circulation are sulfates, with glucuronides accounting for most of the urinary metabolites.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion:</span></p><p>Plasma clearance value for norethindrone is approximately 0.4 L/hr/kg. Norethindrone is excreted in both urine and feces, primarily as metabolites. The mean terminal elimination half-life of norethindrone following a single dose  administration of Norethindrone Acetate tablets is approximately 9 hours.</p><h3>SPECIAL POPULATIONS</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Geriatrics</span></p><p>The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone after Norethindrone Acetate tablets administration has not been evaluated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Race</span></p><p>The effect of race on the disposition of norethindrone after Norethindrone Acetate tablets administration has not been evaluated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Insufficiency</span></p><p>The effect of renal disease on the disposition of norethindrone after Norethindrone Acetate tablets administration has not been evaluated. In premenopausal women with chronic renal failure undergoing peritoneal dialysis who received multiple doses of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, plasma norethindrone concentration was unchanged compared to concentrations in premenopausal women with normal renal function.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatic Insufficiency</span></p><p>The effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of norethindrone after Norethindrone Acetate tablets administration has not been evaluated. However, Norethindrone Acetate tablets are contraindicated in markedly impaired liver function or liver disease.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies investigating any drug-drug interactions with Norethindrone Acetate tablets have been conducted.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">Norethindrone Acetate tablets are indicated for the treatment of secondary amenorrhea, endometriosis, and  abnormal uterine bleeding due to hormonal imbalance in the absence of organic pathology, such as submucous fibroids or uterine cancer. <span class="Bold">Norethindrone Acetate tablets are not intended, recommended or approved to be used with concomitant estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women for endometrial protection.</span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><ul>
<li>Known or suspected pregnancy. There is no indication for Norethindrone Acetate tablets in pregnancy. (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>.)</li>
<li>Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding</li>
<li>Known, suspected or history of cancer of the breast</li>
<li>Active deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or history of these conditions</li>
<li>Active or recent (e.g., within the past year) arterial thromboembolic disease (e.g., stroke, myocardial  infarction)</li>
<li>Impaired liver function or liver disease</li>
<li>As a diagnostic test for pregnancy</li>
<li>Hypersensitivity to any of the drug components</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">1   Cardiovascular disorders</span><br/>
     Patients with risk factors for arterial vascular disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use,    hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (e.g., personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately.</p><p><span class="Bold">2    Visual abnormalities</span><br/>
      Discontinue medication pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, medication should be discontinued.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>1 General Precautions</h3><ul>
<li>Because this drug may cause some degree of fluid retention, conditions which might be influenced by this factor, such as epilepsy, migraine, cardiac or renal dysfunctions, require careful observation</li>
<li>In cases of breakthrough bleeding, and in all cases of irregular bleeding per vagina, nonfunctional causes should be borne in mind. In cases of undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated</li>
<li>Patients who have a history of clinical depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if the depression recurs to a serious degree</li>
<li>Data suggest that progestin therapy may have adverse effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. The choice of progestin, its dose, and its regimen may be important in minimizing these adverse effects, but these issues will require further study before they are clarified. Women with hyperlipidemias and/or   diabetes should be monitored closely during progestin therapy</li>
<li>The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted</li>
</ul><h3>2 Information for the Patient</h3><p class="First">Healthcare providers are advised to discuss the PATIENT INFORMATION leaflet with patients for whom they prescribe Norethindrone Acetate tablets.</p><h3>3 Drug/Laboratory Tests Interactions</h3><p class="First">The following laboratory test results may be altered by the use of estrogen/progestin combination drugs:</p><h3>4 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Some beagle dogs treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate developed mammary nodules. Although nodules occasionally appeared in control animals, they were intermittent in nature, whereas nodules in treated animals were larger and more numerous, and persisted. There is no general agreement as to whether the nodules are benign or malignant. Their significance with respect to humans has not been established.</p><h3>5 Pregnancy Category X</h3><p class="First">Norethindrone Acetate is contraindicated during pregnancy as it may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Several reports suggest an association between intrauterine exposure to progestational drugs in the first trimester of pregnancy and congenital abnormalities in male and female fetuses. Some progestational drugs induce mild virilization of the external genitalia of female fetuses.</p><h3>6 Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Detectable amounts of progestins have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving them. Caution should be exercised when progestins are administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>7 Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Norethindrone Acetate tablets are not indicated in children.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span></p><p>The following adverse reactions have been observed in women taking progestins:</p><ul>
<li>Breakthrough bleeding</li>
<li>Spotting</li>

<li><span class="Bold">Risk to the Fetus:</span></li>
</ul><p>Norethindrone Acetate tablets should not be used if you are pregnant. Norethindrone Acetate tablets are contraindicated during pregnancy as it may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There is an increased risk of minor birth defects in children whose mothers take this drug during the first 4 months of pregnancy. Several reports suggest an association between mothers who take these drugs in the first trimester of pregnancy and congenital abnormalities in male and female babies. Although it is not clear that these events were drug related, you should check with your healthcare provider about the risks to your unborn child of any medication taken during pregnancy.</p><p>You should avoid using Norethindrone Acetate tablets during pregnancy. If you take Norethindrone Acetate tablets and later find you were pregnant when you took it, be sure to discuss this with your healthcare provider as soon as possible.</p><ul>
<li><span class="Bold">Abnormal Blood Clotting:</span></li>
</ul><p>Use of progestational drugs, such as Norethindrone Acetate tablets, has been associated with changes in the blood-clotting system. These changes allow the blood to clot more easily, possibly allowing clots to form in the bloodstream. If blood clots do form in your bloodstream, they can cut off the blood supply to vital organs, causing serious problems. These problems may include a stroke (by cutting off blood to part of the brain), a heart attack (by cutting off blood to part of the heart), a pulmonary embolus (by cutting off blood to part of the lungs), visual loss or blindness (by cutting off blood vessels in the eye), or other problems. Any of these conditions may cause death or serious long-term disability. Call your healthcare provider right away if you suspect you have any of these conditions. He or she may advise you to stop using the drug.</p><ul>
<li><span class="Bold">Eye Abnormalities:</span></li>
