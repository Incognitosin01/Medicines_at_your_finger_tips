Other signs of a severe reaction include fever, swelling in your face or tongue, mouth sores, trouble breathing, swelling in your legs, yellowing of your skin or eyes, and skin rash or blistering sores.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use this medicine if you are allergic to armodafinil or modafinil (Provigil).</p><p>To make sure armodafinil is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

</ul><p>liver or kidney disease;</p><p>a heart muscle or valve disorder such as mitral valve prolapse;</p><p>high blood pressure, heart disease, or prior heart attack;</p><p>mental illness or psychosis; or</p><p>drug or alcohol addiction.</p><p>It is not known whether armodafinil will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p>Use a barrier form of birth control (condom or diaphragm with spermicide). Hormonal contraception (birth control pills, injections, implants, skin patches, and vaginal rings) may not be effective enough to prevent pregnancy during your treatment.</p><p>It is not known whether armodafinil passes into breast milk or if it could affect the nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding.</p><p>Armodafinil is not approved for use by anyone younger than 17 years old.</p><h2>How should I take armodafinil?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not take  armodafinil in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Armodafinil may be habit-forming. <b>Never share armodafinil with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction.</b> Selling or giving away armodafinil is against the law.</p><p>Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>Armodafinil is usually taken each morning to prevent daytime sleepiness, or 1 hour before the start of a work shift to treat work-time sleep disorders.</p><p>You may take armodafinil with or without food.</p><p>Armodafinil is usually given for up to 12 weeks. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>If you are taking armodafinil to treat sleepiness caused by obstructive sleep apnea, you may also be treated with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. This machine is an air pump connected to mask that gently blows pressurized air into your nose while you sleep. The pump does not breathe for you, but the gentle force of air helps keep your airway open to prevent obstruction.</p><p>Do not stop using your CPAP machine during sleep unless your doctor tells you to. The combination of treatment with CPAP and armodafinil may be necessary to best treat your condition.</p><p>Taking this medication does not take the place of getting enough sleep. Talk with your doctor if you continue to have excessive sleepiness even while taking armodafinil. Armodafinil will not cure obstructive sleep apnea or treat its underlying causes. Follow your doctor's instructions about all your other treatments for this disorder.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>Keep track of your medicine. Armodafinil is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, but avoid taking the medication if you do not plan to be awake for several hours. If it is close to your normal bedtime hour, you may need to skip the missed dose and wait until the next day to take the medicine again.</p><p>Talk with your doctor about what to do if you miss a dose of armodafinil. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>Overdose symptoms may include nausea, diarrhea, confusion, feeling restless or excited, fast or slow heart rate, chest pain, trouble sleeping, or hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking armodafinil?</h2><p>Armodafinil may impair your thinking or reactions.
