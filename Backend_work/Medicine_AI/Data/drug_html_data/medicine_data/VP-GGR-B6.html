Prescription Folate</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION:</span> VP-GGR-B6 is an orally administered PRENATAL prescription folate specifically formulated for the dietary management of patients with unique nutritional needs requiring increased folate levels.</p><p>VP-GGR-B6 should be administered under the supervision of a licensed medical practitioner.</p><p>Each round, pink tablet contains the following dietary ingredients:</p><p class="First">Vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span> (pyridoxine HCl)</p><p class="First">40 mg</p><p class="First">Folic Acid</p><p class="First">1.2 mg</p><p class="First">Calcium (as dicalcium phosphate and tricalcium phosphate)</p><p class="First">124.1 mg</p><p class="First">100 mg*</p><p>Other Ingredients: Acacia, Citric Acid, Magnesium Stearate, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Pink Coating (FD&amp;C Red#40 Lake, Hydroxypropylmethyl Cellulose, Polyethylene Glycol, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Talc, Titanium Dioxide), Polyvinylpyrrolidone, Silicified Microcrystalline Cellulose, Stearic Acid, and TriPotassium Citrate</p><p>Since colors, flavors of natural origin vary from batch to batch in consistency - it may be necessary to substitute excipients as needed to ensure the highest therapeutic target, safety and quality.</p><p>Daily Values not established for patients with unique nutritional needs who are in need of supplementation as directed by a licensed medical practitioner.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOLATE REGULATION:</span> The term "folate" are B vitamins that include folic acid and any forms of active pteroylglutamates regardless of the reduction state of the molecule. Folates, or vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span>, are primarily hydrolyzed in the intestinal jejunum and the liver to the active circulating form of folate, l-methylfolate, with an intermediate stable form, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate.</p><p>Individuals with genetic polymorphisms for the genes coding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) may not be capable of utilizing or metabolizing folic acid adequately for the vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> dependent methylation cycle.</p><p>Folic acid, including reduced forms1 such as folinic acid, may obscure pernicious anemia above 0.1 mg doses, and must be administered under the supervision of a licensed medical practitioner.</p><p>The 1971, 1972, 1973, 1980, 1984, 2000, and 2010 Federal Register Notices addressed this concern while establishing that increased folate was proper therapy in megaloblastic anemias - specifically where homocysteine levels were elevated or risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) was at issue. The Federal Register Notice of August 2, 1973 (38 FR 20750) specifically states that:</p><p>Folic acid - including reduced forms, may be added to medical foods as defined in section 5(b)(3) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 USC 360ee(b)(3)), or to food (21 CFR 172.345).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</span> VP-GGR-B6 is indicated for the distinct nutritional requirements of patients in need of PRENATAL dietary supplementation as determined by a licensed medical practitioner.</p><p>VP-GGR-B6 should be administered under the supervision of a licensed medical practitioner.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS:</span> This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span> VP-GGR-B6 contains ginger.

Please consult your healthcare practitioner or pharmacist for more information.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> General: Folate, when administered as a single agent in doses about 0.1 mg daily, may obscure the detection of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency (specifically, the administration of folic acid may reverse the hematological manifestations of B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency, including pernicious anemia, while not addressing the neurological manifestations). Folate therapy alone is inadequate for treatment of a vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PATIENT INFORMATION:</span> VP-GGR-B6 is a PRENATAL prescription folate to be used only under licensed medical supervision.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DRUG INTERACTIONS:</span> Drugs which may interact with folate<span class="Sup">**</span> include:</p><p><span class="Sup">**</span> Folate is a broad term that includes folic acid and all reduced forms including l-methylfolate and folinic acid.
