</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Mupirocin</h2><p class="First">Mupirocin Ointment USP, 2% is indicated for the topical treatment of impetigo due to susceptible isolates of <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)</span> and <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes)</span>.</p><h2>Mupirocin Dosage and Administration</h2><ul>
<li>For Topical Use Only.</li>
<li>Apply a small amount of Mupirocin ointment, with a cotton swab or gauze pad, to the affected area 3 times daily for up to 10 days.</li>
<li>Cover the treated area with gauze dressing if desired.</li>
<li>Re-evaluate patients not showing a clinical response within 3 to 5 days.</li>
<li>Mupirocin ointment is not for intranasal, ophthalmic, or other mucosal use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6)]</span> .</li>
<li>Do not apply Mupirocin ointment concurrently with any other lotions, creams, or ointments <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Each gram of Mupirocin ointment contains 20 mg Mupirocin in a water-miscible ointment base supplied in 15-gram, 22-gram and 30-gram tubes.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Mupirocin ointment is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Mupirocin or any of the excipients of Mupirocin ointment.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Severe Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, and generalized rash, have been reported in patients treated with formulations of Mupirocin, including Mupirocin ointment <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span> .</p><h3>Eye Irritation</h3><p class="First">Avoid contact with the eyes. In case of accidental contact, rinse well with water.</p><h3>Local Irritation</h3><p class="First">In the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation from Mupirocin ointment, usage should be discontinued, and appropriate alternative therapy for the infection instituted.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile-</span>associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Potential for Microbial Overgrowth</h3><p class="First">As with other antibacterial products, prolonged use of Mupirocin ointment may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms, including fungi <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span> .</p><h3>Risk Associated with Mucosal Use</h3><p class="First">Mupirocin ointment is not formulated for use on mucosal surfaces. Intranasal use has been associated with isolated reports of stinging and drying. A separate formulation, Mupirocin calcium nasal ointment, is available for intranasal use.</p><h3>Risk of Polyethylene Glycol Absorption</h3><p class="First">Polyethylene glycol can be absorbed from open wounds and damaged skin and is excreted by the kidneys. In common with other polyethylene glycol-based ointments, Mupirocin ointment should not be used in conditions where absorption of large quantities of polyethylene glycol is possible, especially if there is evidence of moderate or severe renal impairment.</p><h3>Risk Associated with Use at Intravenous Sites</h3><p class="First">Mupirocin ointment should not be used with intravenous cannulae or at central intravenous sites because of the potential to promote fungal infections and antimicrobial resistance.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</span></p><ul>
<li>Severe Allergic Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Eye Irritation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>Local Irritation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
<li>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] ​</li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The following local adverse reactions were reported by at least 1% of subjects in connection with the use of Mupirocin ointment in clinical trials: burning, stinging, or pain in 1.5% of subjects; itching in 1% of subjects. Rash, nausea, erythema, dry skin, tenderness, swelling, contact dermatitis, and increased exudate were reported in less than 1% of subjects.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Mupirocin ointment. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal relationship to Mupirocin ointment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Immune System Disorders</span></p><p>Systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, and generalized rash <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> .</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk with Mupirocin ointment in pregnant women. Systemic absorption of Mupirocin through intact human skin is minimal following topical administration of Mupirocin ointment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> . No developmental toxicity was observed in rats or rabbits treated with Mupirocin subcutaneously during organogenesis at doses of 160 mg per kg per day or 40 mg per kg per day, respectively (22 and 11 times the human topical dose based on calculations of dose divided by the entire body surface area).</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages for the indicated population is unknown. The estimated background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First">Animal Data: Developmental toxicity studies have been performed with Mupirocin administered subcutaneously to rats and rabbits at doses up to 160 mg per kg per day during organogenesis. This dose is 22 and 43 times, respectively, the human topical dose (approximately 60 mg Mupirocin per day) based on calculations of dose divided by the entire body surface area. Maternal toxicity was observed (body weight loss/decreased body weight gain and reduced feeding) in both species with no evidence of developmental toxicity in rats. In rabbits, excessive maternal toxicity at the high dose precluded the evaluation of fetal outcomes. There was no developmental toxicity in rabbits at 40 mg per kg per day, 11 times the human topical dose based on calculations of dose divided by the entire body surface area.</p><p>Mupirocin administered subcutaneously to rats in a pre- and postnatal development study (dosed during late gestation through lactation) was associated with reduced offspring viability in the early postnatal period at a dose of 106.7 mg per kg, in the presence of injection site irritation and/or subcutaneous hemorrhaging. This dose is 14 times the human topical dose based on calculations of dose divided by the entire body surface area. The no-observed adverse effect level in this study was 44.2 mg per kg per day, which is 6 times the human topical dose.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>It is not known whether Mupirocin is present in human milk, has effects on the breastfed child, or has effects on milk production. However, breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to the drug due to the minimal systemic absorption of Mupirocin in humans following topical administration of Mupirocin ointment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Mupirocin ointment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Mupirocin ointment or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>To minimize oral exposure of the drug to children, a breast and/or nipple being treated with Mupirocin ointment should be thoroughly washed prior to breastfeeding.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Mupirocin ointment have been established in the age range of 2 months to 16 years. Use of Mupirocin ointment in these age-groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials of Mupirocin ointment in impetigo in pediatric subjects studied as a part of the pivotal clinical trials in adults <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span> .</p><h2>Mupirocin Description</h2><p class="First">Mupirocin Ointment USP, 2% contains the RNA synthetase inhibitor antibacterial, Mupirocin. The chemical name is ( <span class="Italics">E</span>)-(2 <span class="Italics">S</span>,3 <span class="Italics">R</span>,4 <span class="Italics">R</span>,5 <span class="Italics">S</span>)-5-[(2 <span class="Italics">S</span>,3 <span class="Italics">S</span>,4 <span class="Italics">S</span>,5 <span class="Italics">S</span>)-2,3-epoxy-5-hydroxy-4-methylhexyl] tetrahydro-3,4-dihydroxy-ß-methyl-2 <span class="Italics">H</span>-pyran-2-crotonic acid, ester with 9-hydroxynonanoic acid. The molecular formula of Mupirocin is C <span class="Sub">26</span>H <span class="Sub">44</span>O <span class="Sub">9</span>, and the molecular weight is 500.6. The structural formula of Mupirocin is:</p><p>Each gram of Mupirocin ointment, 2% contains 20 mg Mupirocin in a water-miscible ointment base (polyethylene glycol ointment) consisting of polyethylene glycol 400 and polyethylene glycol 3350.</p><h2>Mupirocin - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Mupirocin is an RNA synthetase inhibitor antibacterial <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)]</span> .</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Application of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled Mupirocin ointment to the lower arm of normal male subjects followed by occlusion for 24 hours showed no measurable systemic absorption (less than 1.1 nanogram Mupirocin per milliliter of whole blood). Measurable radioactivity was present in the stratum corneum of these subjects 72 hours after application.</p><p>The effect of the concurrent application of Mupirocin ointment with other topical products has not been studied <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span> .</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>In a trial conducted in 7 healthy adult male subjects, the elimination half-life after intravenous administration of Mupirocin was 20 to 40 minutes for Mupirocin and 30 to 80 minutes for monic acid.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Metabolism:</span> Following intravenous or oral administration, Mupirocin is rapidly metabolized. The principal metabolite, monic acid, demonstrates no antibacterial activity.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Excretion:</span> Monic acid is predominantly eliminated by renal excretion.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">Mupirocin is an RNA synthetase inhibitor antibacterial produced by fermentation using the organism <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas fluorescens</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>Mupirocin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specifically binding to bacterial isoleucyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase.</p><p>Mupirocin is bactericidal at concentrations achieved by topical administration. Mupirocin is highly protein bound (greater than 97%) and the effect of wound secretions on the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Mupirocin has not been determined.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Resistance</span></p><p>When Mupirocin resistance occurs, it results from the production of a modified isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, or the acquisition of, by genetic transfer, a plasmid mediating a new isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. High-level plasmid-mediated resistance (MIC ≥512 mcg/mL) has been reported in increasing numbers of isolates of <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> and with higher frequency in coagulase-negative staphylococci. Mupirocin resistance occurs with greater frequency in methicillin-resistant than methicillin-susceptible staphylococci.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cross Resistance</span></p><p>Due to its mode of action, Mupirocin does not demonstrate cross resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antimicrobial Activity</span></p><p>Mupirocin has been shown to be active against susceptible isolates of <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> and <span class="Italics">S. pyogenes</span>, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1)]</span> . The following <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Mupirocin is active against most isolates of <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Susceptibility Test Methods</span></p><p>High-level Mupirocin resistance (≥512 mcg/mL) may be determined using standard disk diffusion or broth microdilution tests. <span class="Sup">1,2</span> Because of the occurrence of Mupirocin resistance in methicillin-resistant <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> (MRSA), it is appropriate to test MRSA populations for Mupirocin susceptibility prior to the use of Mupirocin using a standardized method. <span class="Sup">3,4,5</span></p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of Mupirocin have not been conducted.</p><p>Results of the following studies performed with Mupirocin calcium or Mupirocin sodium <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> did not indicate a potential for genotoxicity: rat primary hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis, sediment analysis for DNA strand breaks, <span class="Italics">Salmonella</span> reversion test (Ames), <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span> mutation assay, metaphase analysis of human lymphocytes, mouse lymphoma assay, and bone marrow micronuclei assay in mice.</p><p>In a fertility/reproductive performance study (with dosing through lactation), Mupirocin administered subcutaneously to male and female rats at doses up to 100 mg per kg per day which is 14 times the human topical dose (approximately 60 mg Mupirocin per day) based on calculations of dose divided by the entire body surface area, did not result in impaired fertility or impaired reproductive performance attributable to Mupirocin.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of topical Mupirocin ointment in impetigo was tested in 2 trials. In the first, subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either Mupirocin ointment or vehicle placebo 3 times daily for 8 to 12 days. Clinical efficacy rates at end of therapy in the evaluable populations (adults and pediatric subjects included) were 71% for Mupirocin ointment (n = 49) and 35% for vehicle placebo (n = 51). Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable populations were 94% for Mupirocin ointment and 62% for vehicle placebo.</p><p>In the second trial, subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either Mupirocin ointment 3 times daily or 30 mg per kg to 40 mg per kg oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate per day (this was an unblinded trial) for 8 days. There was a follow-up visit 1 week after treatment ended. Clinical efficacy rates at the follow-up visit in the evaluable populations (adults and pediatric subjects included) were 93% for Mupirocin ointment (n = 29) and 78.5% for erythromycin (n = 28). Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable populations were 100% for both test groups.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatrics</span></p><p>There were 91 pediatric subjects aged 2 months to 15 years in the first trial described above. Clinical efficacy rates at end of therapy in the evaluable populations were 78% for Mupirocin ointment (n = 42) and 36% for vehicle placebo (n = 49). In the second trial described above, all subjects were pediatric except 2 adults in the group receiving Mupirocin ointment. The age range of the pediatric subjects was 7 months to 13 years. The clinical efficacy rate for Mupirocin ointment (n = 27) was 96%, and for erythromycin it was unchanged (78.5%).</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Each gram of Mupirocin ointment contains 20 mg Mupirocin in a water-miscible ointment base.</p><p>Mupirocin Ointment USP, 2% is supplied as follows:</p><p>NDC 50268-568-15 (50 individual one gram tubes)</p><p>Dispensed in Unit Dose Packaging.
