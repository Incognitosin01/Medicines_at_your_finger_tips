A second vaccine dose is not necessary for postexposure prophylaxis but should be considered in 6 months following initial dose to complete the hepatitis A vaccine series to ensure long-term immunity (CDC/ACIP [Nelson 2018]).</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>For IM administration. The deltoid muscle is the preferred site for injection. Do not administer to the gluteal region; may decrease efficacy. Do not administer intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously. Shake well prior to use; discard if the suspension is discolored or does not appear homogenous after shaking, or if there are cracks in the vial or syringe. Do not dilute. Do not mix with other vaccines or injections; separate needles and syringes should be used for each injection (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). To prevent syncope related injuries, patients should be vaccinated while seated or lying down (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). US law requires that the date of administration, the vaccine manufacturer, lot number of vaccine, Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) edition date and date it was provided, and the administering person's name, title, and address be recorded.</p><p>For patients at risk of hemorrhage following intramuscular injection, the vaccine should be administered intramuscularly if, in the opinion of the physician familiar with the patient's bleeding risk, the vaccine can be administered by this route with reasonable safety. If the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, intramuscular vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered. A fine needle (23 gauge or smaller) can be used for the vaccination and firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. The patient should be instructed concerning the risk of hematoma from the injection. Patients on anticoagulant therapy should be considered to have the same bleeding risks and treated as those with clotting factor disorders (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store refrigerated between 2°C and 8°C (36°F and 46°F). Do not freeze; discard if the product has been frozen. Extended storage information at room temperature may be available; contact product manufacturer to obtain current recommendations.</p><p>VAQTA: Canadian labeling suggests that the vaccine may be used if cumulative exposure to temperatures of 0°C to 2°C (32°F to 36°F) or 8°C to 25°C (46°F to 77°F) is ≤72 hours.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Fingolimod: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated).

Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever); vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia); bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; if the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM injection can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). Canadian product labeling suggests that subcutaneous administration may be considered in exceptional circumstances (eg, patients with thrombocytopenia or at risk for hemorrhage); however, this may convey a higher risk for local reactions (eg, injection site nodule). In healthy adults, seroconversion following an initial subcutaneous dose of VAQTA was slower than that historically observed following intramuscular administration (Linglöf 2001).</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Recommended for patients with chronic liver disease; however, these patients may have decreased antibody response.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Consider deferring immunization during periods of severe immunosuppression (eg, patients receiving chemo/radiation therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy [including high-dose corticosteroids]); may have a reduced response to vaccination. An exception when administration should not be delayed may include use of the hepatitis A vaccine for preexposure prophylaxis prior to international travel to certain areas (CDC/ACIP [Nelson 2018]). In general, household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive all age-appropriate vaccines. Inactivated vaccines should be administered ≥2 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression when feasible; inactivated vaccines administered during chemotherapy should be readministered after immune competence is regained (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Anticoagulant therapy: Use with caution in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy; bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; ideally vaccinations should be administered prior to initiation of anticoagulation therapy if possible (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist. The use of combination vaccines is generally preferred over separate injections, taking into consideration provider assessment, patient preference, and adverse events. When using combination vaccines, the minimum age for administration is the oldest minimum age for any individual component; the minimum interval between dosing is the greatest minimum interval between any individual components. The ACIP prefers each dose of a specific vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer when possible (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Latex: Packaging may contain natural latex rubber.</p><p>• Neomycin: Some products may contain neomycin.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Antipyretics: Antipyretics have not been shown to prevent febrile seizures; antipyretics may be used to treat fever or discomfort following vaccination (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). One study reported that routine prophylactic administration of acetaminophen prior to vaccination to prevent fever decreased the immune response of some vaccines; the clinical significance of this reduction in immune response has not been established (Prymula 2009).</p><p>• Appropriate use: Use of this vaccine for specific medical and/or other indications (eg, immunocompromising conditions, hepatic or kidney disease, diabetes) is also addressed in the annual ACIP Recommended Immunization Schedules (refer to CDC schedule for detailed information). Specific recommendations for vaccination in immunocompromised patients with asplenia, cancer, HIV infection, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, cochlear implants, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (prior to or after), sickle cell disease, solid organ transplant (prior to or after), or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for chronic conditions as well as contacts of immunocompromised patients are available from the IDSA (Rubin 2014).</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and is improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). Due to the long incubation period for hepatitis A (15 to 50 days), unrecognized hepatitis A infection may be present; immunization may not prevent infection in these patients.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor for anaphylaxis and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>In general, maternal use of inactivated vaccines are not associated with increased risks to the fetus (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). In addition, an increased risk of most adverse maternal or fetal events, including miscarriage or major birth defects, has not been observed following maternal use of the hepatitis A vaccine (Groom 2019; Nasser 2019).</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends immunization for pregnant patients at risk for hepatitis A infection or patients who are at risk for severe outcomes from infection during pregnancy (ACIP [Freedman 2020]). Refer to current immunization schedule for vaccinating pregnant females.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to prevent hepatitis A infection.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
