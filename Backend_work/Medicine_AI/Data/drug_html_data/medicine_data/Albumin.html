Dose depends on condition of patient:</p><p><b>Ascites with hypoalbuminemia:</b> Limited data available: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: 25% albumin: IV: 1 g/kg/dose over 2 to 3 hours; may repeat up to 3 times per day until albumin is &gt;2.5 g/dL; maximum dose: 25 g/dose (Giefer 2011, Sabri 2003)</p><p><b>Hypovolemia, plasma volume expansion, including hypovolemic shock</b> (SCCM [Dellinger 2013]): Infants, Children, and Adolescents: 5% albumin: IV: 0.5 to 1 g/kg/dose (10 to 20 <b>mL</b>/kg/dose) over 5 to 10 minutes.

Do not use sterile water to dilute albumin solutions, as this has been associated with hypotonic-associated hemolysis. If 5% human albumin is unavailable, it may be prepared by diluting 25% human albumin with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose in water.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>For IV administration only. Infusion rate depends on indication and clinical situation. In emergencies, may administer as rapidly as necessary to improve clinical condition. After initial volume replacement: </p><p>5%: Do not exceed 2 to 4 mL/minute in patients with normal plasma volume; 5 to 10 mL/minute in patients with hypoproteinemia </p><p>25%: Do not exceed 1 mL/minute in patients with normal plasma volume; 2 to 3 mL/minute in patients with hypoproteinemia </p><p>Rapid infusion may cause vascular overload. Albumin 25% may be given undiluted or diluted in normal saline. May give in combination or through the same administration set as saline or carbohydrates. Warm to room temperature before use if large volumes are administered. Use within 4 hours after entering package; discard unused portion. Some products may require a filter; refer to product labeling. Do not use with ethanol or protein hydrolysates (precipitation may form).</p><h2>Dietary Considerations</h2><p>Some products may contain potassium and/or sodium.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at ≤30°C (86°F); do not freeze.

Frequency not defined.</p><p>Cardiovascular: Cardiac failure (precipitation), edema, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia</p><p>Central nervous system: Chills, headache</p><p>Dermatologic: Pruritus, skin rash, urticaria</p><p>Endocrine &amp; metabolic: Hypervolemia</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting</p><p>Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis</p><p>Respiratory: Bronchospasm, pulmonary edema</p><p>Miscellaneous: Fever</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Severe allergic or anaphylactic reaction may occur. Discontinue immediately and manage appropriately if allergic or anaphylactic reactions are suspected.</p><p>• Coagulation abnormality: Large replacement volumes may result in coagulation abnormality. Monitor and replete with blood constituents if indicated.</p><p>• Electrolyte imbalance: Large replacement volumes may result in electrolyte imbalance. Monitor electrolytes and replace or maintain as indicated.</p><p>• Hemodynamic effects: Cardiac or respiratory failure, renal failure, or increasing intracranial pressure can occur; closely monitor hemodynamic parameters in all patients.</p><p>• Hypervolemia/hemodilution: Use with caution in conditions where hypervolemia and its consequences or hemodilution may increase the risk of adverse effects (eg, heart failure, pulmonary edema, hypertension, hemorrhagic diathesis, esophageal varices). Adjust rate of administration per hemodynamic status and solution concentration; monitor closely with rapid infusions. Avoid rapid infusions in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (may cause circulatory overload and pulmonary edema). Discontinue at the first signs of cardiovascular overload (eg, headache, dyspnea, jugular venous distention, rales, abnormal elevations in systemic or central venous blood pressure). All patients should be observed for signs of hypervolemia, such as pulmonary edema. Monitor blood pressure.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Critical illness: In patients with increased microvascular permeability (eg, sepsis, trauma, burn), the translocation of fluid from the interstitial compartment to the intravascular compartment may decrease due to increased albumin in the interstitial space. Furthermore, in extreme microvascular permeability states, administration of albumin (or other colloids) may increase the net flux of fluid into the interstitial space reducing intravascular volume and precipitating edematous states (eg, pulmonary edema) (Roberts, 1998).</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; protein load may exacerbate or precipitate encephalopathy.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; protein load may precipitate azotemia. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency receiving albumin solution may be at risk for accumulation of aluminum and potential toxicities (eg, hypercalcemia, vitamin D refractory osteodystrophy, anemia, severe progressive encephalopathy).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Sodium restricted patients: Use with caution in those patients for whom sodium restriction is necessary. Albumin 5% and 25% solutions contain 130 to 160 mEq/L sodium and are considered isotonic with plasma.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Aluminum: The parenteral product may contain aluminum (Kelly, 1989); toxic aluminum concentrations may be seen with high doses, prolonged use, or renal dysfunction. Premature neonates are at higher risk due to immature renal function and aluminum intake from other parenteral sources. Parenteral aluminum exposure of &gt;4 to 5 mcg/kg/day is associated with CNS and bone toxicity; tissue loading may occur at lower doses (Federal Register 2002). See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p>• Dilution: Do not dilute 5% albumin with sterile water for injection (may result in hemolysis and/or renal failure).</p><p>• Human plasma: Product of human plasma; may potentially contain infectious agents which could transmit disease. Screening of donors, as well as testing and/or inactivation or removal of certain viruses, reduces the risk. Infections thought to be transmitted by this product should be reported to the manufacturer.</p><p>• Latex: Packaging may contain natural latex rubber.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor electrolytes, hemoglobin/hematocrit, and urine output regularly; monitor hemodynamic parameters, blood pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Albumin is an endogenous substance; products are prepared from pooled human plasma. Available data are insufficient to recommend use of albumin to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (Practice Committee 2016). Use for other indications may be considered in pregnant women when contraindications to nonprotein colloids exist (Liumbruno 2009).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat or prevent low blood volume, to treat low blood pressure, to replace albumin in people with low blood albumin levels. It may be given for other reasons. Talk with doctor.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug. Tell your doctor or get medical help right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms that may be related to a very bad side effect:</b></p><p>• Fluid and electrolyte problems like mood changes, confusion, muscle pain or weakness, abnormal heartbeat, severe dizziness or passing out, fast heartbeat, increased thirst, seizures, loss of strength and energy, lack of appetite, unable to pass urine or change in amount of urine passed, dry mouth, dry eyes, or nausea or vomiting</p><p>• Dizziness</p><p>• Passing out</p><p>• Vision changes</p><p>• Headache</p><p>• Shortness of breath</p><p>• Excessive weight gain</p><p>• Swelling of arms or legs</p><p>• Signs of an allergic reaction, like rash; hives; itching; red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin with or without fever; wheezing; tightness in the chest or throat; trouble breathing, swallowing, or talking; unusual hoarseness; or swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p><b>Note:</b> This is not a comprehensive list of all side effects.
