•  Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.<br/>
•  Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required.<br/>
•  Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</span></p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">Clobazam Oral Suspension is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age or older.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><h3>Dosing Information</h3><p class="First">A daily dose of Clobazam Oral Suspension greater than 5 mg should be administered in divided doses twice daily; a 5 mg daily dose can be administered as a single dose. Dose patients according to body weight. Individualize dosing within each body weight group, based on clinical efficacy and tolerability. Each dose in Table 1 (e.g., 5 mg to 20 mg in ≤30 kg weight group) has been shown to be effective, although effectiveness increases with increasing dose <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span> Do not proceed with dose escalation more rapidly than weekly, because serum concentrations of clobazam and its active metabolite require 5 and 9 days, respectively, to reach steady-state.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Table 1. Recommended Total Daily Dosing by Weight Group<br/></span></p><h3>Gradual Withdrawal</h3><p class="First">As with all antiepileptic drugs and benzodiazepines, withdraw Clobazam Oral Suspension gradually. Taper by decreasing the total daily dose by 5 mg to 10 mg/day on a weekly basis until discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].<br/></span></p><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Instruct patients to read the “Instructions for Use” carefully for complete directions on how to properly dose and administer Clobazam Oral Suspension.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Clobazam Oral Suspension Oral Administration</span><br/>
Clobazam Oral Suspension can be taken with or without food <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span><br/>
Shake Clobazam Oral Suspension well before every administration. When administering the oral suspension, use only the oral dosing syringe provided with the product.  Each carton includes two syringes, but only one syringe should be used for dosing.  The second oral syringe is reserved as a replacement in case the first syringe is damaged or lost. Insert the provided adapter firmly into the neck of the bottle before first use and keep the adapter in place for the duration of the usage of the bottle. To withdraw the dose, insert the dosing syringe into the adapter and invert the bottle then slowly pull back the plunger to prescribed dose. After removing the syringe from the bottle adapter, slowly squirt Clobazam Oral Suspension into the corner of the patient’s mouth. Replace the cap after each use. The cap fits over the adapter when the adapter is properly placed. See Clobazam Oral Suspension “Instructions for Use” for complete instruction on how to properly dose and administer the Clobazam Oral Suspension.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustments in Geriatric Patients</h3><p class="First">Plasma concentrations at any given dose are generally higher in the elderly: proceed slowly with dose escalation. The starting dose should be 5 mg/day for all elderly patients. Then titrate elderly patients according to weight, but to half the dose presented in Table 1, as tolerated. If necessary and based upon clinical response, an additional titration to the maximum dose (20 mg/day or 40 mg/day, depending on weight) may be started on day 21 <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].<br/></span></p><h3>Dosage Adjustments in CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizers</h3><p class="First">In CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, levels of N-desmethylclobazam, clobazam’s active metabolite, will be increased. Therefore, in patients known to be CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, the starting dose should be 5 mg/day and dose titration should proceed slowly according to weight, but to half the dose presented in Table 1, as tolerated. If necessary and based upon clinical response, an additional titration to the maximum dose (20 mg/day or 40 mg/day, depending on the weight group) may be started on day 21 <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].<br/></span></p><h3>Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. There is no experience with Clobazam Oral Suspension in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (ESRD). It is not known if clobazam or its active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, is dialyzable <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<br/></span></p><h3>Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Clobazam Oral Suspension is hepatically metabolized; however, there are limited data to characterize the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Clobazam Oral Suspension. For this reason, proceed slowly with dosing escalations. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 9), the starting dose should be 5 mg/day in both weight groups. Then titrate patients according to weight, but to half the dose presented in Table 1, as tolerated. If necessary and based upon clinical response, start an additional titration on day 21 to the maximum dose (20 mg/day or 40 mg/day, depending on the weight group). There is inadequate information about metabolism of Clobazam Oral Suspension in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore no dosing recommendation in those patients can be given <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.8), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<br/></span></p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First">Oral Suspension: 2.5 mg/mL for oral administration. Each bottle contains 120 mL of an off-white suspension.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Clobazam Oral Suspension is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients. Hypersensitivity reactions have included serious dermatological reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].<br/></span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including Clobazam Oral Suspension, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.<br/>
<br/>
Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe Clobazam Oral Suspension concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Clobazam Oral Suspension is used with opioids <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><h3>Potentiation of Sedation from Concomitant Use with Central Nervous System Depressants</h3><p class="First">Since clobazam has a central nervous system (CNS) depressant effect, patients or their caregivers should be cautioned against simultaneous use with other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol, and cautioned that the effects of other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol may be potentiated <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)].<br/></span></p><h3>Somnolence or Sedation</h3><p class="First">Clobazam causes somnolence and sedation. In clinical trials, somnolence or sedation was reported at all effective doses and was dose-related.<br/>
<br/>
In general, somnolence and sedation begin within the first month of treatment and may diminish with continued treatment. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation, particularly with concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants. Prescribers should caution patients against engaging in hazardous activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating dangerous machinery or motor vehicles, until the effect of clobazam is known.</p><h3>Withdrawal Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Abrupt discontinuation of Clobazam Oral Suspension should be avoided. Clobazam Oral Suspension should be tapered by decreasing the dose every week by 5 mg to 10 mg/day until discontinuation <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].<br/></span><br/>
Withdrawal symptoms occurred following abrupt discontinuation of Clobazam Oral Suspension; the risk of withdrawal symptoms is greater with higher doses.<br/>
<br/>
As with all antiepileptic drugs, Clobazam Oral Suspension should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the risk of precipitating seizures, seizure exacerbation, or status epilepticus.<br/>
<br/>
Withdrawal symptoms (e.g., convulsions, psychosis, hallucinations, behavioral disorder, tremor, and anxiety) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines. The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to patients who received excessive doses over an extended period of time, followed by an abrupt discontinuation. Generally milder withdrawal symptoms (e.g., dysphoria, anxiety, and insomnia) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic doses for several months.</p><h3>Serious Dermatological Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported with clobazam in both children and adults during the postmarketing period. Patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of SJS/TEN, especially during the first 8 weeks of treatment initiation or when re-introducing therapy. Clobazam Oral Suspension should be discontinued at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Physical and Psychological Dependence</h3><p class="First">Patients with a history of substance abuse should be under careful surveillance when receiving Clobazam Oral Suspension or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition of such patients to habituation and dependence <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].</span></p><h3>Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</h3><p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Clobazam Oral Suspension, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.<br/>
Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted relative risk 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.<br/>
The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.<br/>
The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Table 2. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis</span></p><p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.<br/>
Anyone considering prescribing Clobazam Oral Suspension or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.<br/>
Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Clinically significant adverse reactions that appear in other sections of the labeling include the following:<br/>

<br/>
During its development for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with LGS, clobazam was administered to 333 healthy volunteers and 300 patients with a current or prior diagnosis of LGS, including 197 patients treated for 12 months or more. The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly and included single- and multiple-dose clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers and two double-blind studies in patients with LGS (Study 1 and 2) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span> Only Study 1 included a placebo group, allowing comparison of adverse reaction rates on clobazam at several doses to placebo.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in an LGS Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial (Study 1)</span><br/>
The adverse reactions associated with clobazam treatment discontinuation in ≥1% of patients in decreasing order of frequency included lethargy, somnolence, ataxia, aggression, fatigue, and insomnia.  <br/>
<span class="Bold">Most Common Adverse Reactions in an LGS Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial (Study 1)</span><br/>
Table 3 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in  ≥5% of clobazam-treated patients (at any dose), and at a rate greater than placebo-treated patients, in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical study of adjunctive AED therapy for 15 weeks (Study 1).<br/>

<span class="Italics">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:</span> Rash, urticaria, angioedema, and facial and lip edema</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Opioids</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites, and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].<br/></span></p><h3>CNS Depressants and Alcohol</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of clobazam with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and somnolence <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span><br/>
<br/>
Alcohol, as a CNS depressant, will interact with clobazam in a similar way and also increases clobazam’s maximum plasma exposure by approximately 50%. Therefore, caution patients or their caregivers against simultaneous use with other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol, and caution that the effects of other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol may be potentiated <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].<br/></span></p><h3>Effect of Clobazam on Other Drugs</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hormonal Contraceptives</span><br/>
Clobazam is a weak CYP3A4 inducer. As some hormonal contraceptives are metabolized by CYP3A4, their effectiveness may be diminished when given with clobazam. Additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended when using clobazam <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span> <br/>
<span class="Bold">Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6</span><br/>
Clobazam inhibits CYP2D6. Dose adjustment of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 may be necessary <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Effect of Other Drugs on Clobazam</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19</span><br/>
Strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19 may result in increased exposure to N-desmethylclobazam, the active metabolite of clobazam. This may increase the risk of dose-related adverse reactions. Dosage adjustment of clobazam may be necessary when co-administered with strong CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole, fluvoxamine, ticlopidine) or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Registry</span><br/>
There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, such as clobazam, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking clobazam enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll-free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of clobazam in pregnant women. Available data suggest that the class of benzodiazepines is not associated with marked increases in risk for congenital anomalies. Although some early epidemiological studies suggested a relationship between benzodiazepine drug use in pregnancy and congenital anomalies such as cleft lip and or palate, these studies had considerable limitations. More recently completed studies of benzodiazepine use in pregnancy have not consistently documented elevated risks for specific congenital anomalies. There is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of benzodiazepine pregnancy exposure on neurodevelopment.<br/>
<br/>
There are clinical considerations regarding exposure to benzodiazepines during the second and third trimester of pregnancy or immediately prior to or during childbirth. These risks include decreased fetal movement and/or fetal heart rate variability, "floppy infant syndrome," dependence, and withdrawal <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Considerations and Human Data].<br/></span><br/>
Administration of clobazam to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis or to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in developmental toxicity, including increased incidences of fetal malformations and mortality, at plasma exposures for clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, below those expected at therapeutic doses in patients <span class="Italics">[see Animal Data].</span> Data for other benzodiazepines suggest the possibility of long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines at clinically relevant doses. Clobazam should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Advise a pregnant woman and women of childbearing age of the potential risk to a fetus.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</span><br/>
Infants born to mothers who have taken benzodiazepines during the later stages of pregnancy can develop dependence, and subsequently withdrawal, during the postnatal period. Clinical manifestations of withdrawal or neonatal abstinence syndrome may include hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hypoventilation, irritability, tremors, diarrhea, and vomiting. These complications can appear shortly after delivery to 3 weeks after birth and persist from hours to several months depending on the degree of dependence and the pharmacokinetic profile of the benzodiazepine. Symptoms may be mild and transient or severe. Standard management for neonatal withdrawal syndrome has not yet been defined. Observe newborns who are exposed to clobazam <span class="Italics">in utero</span> during the later stages of pregnancy for symptoms of withdrawal and manage accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Labor and Delivery</span><br/>
Administration of benzodiazepines immediately prior to or during childbirth can result in a floppy infant syndrome, which is characterized by lethargy, hypothermia, hypotonia, respiratory depression, and difficulty feeding. Floppy infant syndrome occurs mainly within the first hours after birth and may last up to 14 days. Observe exposed newborns for these symptoms and manage accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Data</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Human Data</span><br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Congenital Anomalies</span></span><br/>
Although there are no adequate and well controlled studies of clobazam in pregnant women, there is information about benzodiazepines as a class. Dolovich et al. published a meta-analysis of 23 studies that examined the effects of benzodiazepine exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. Eleven of the 23 studies included in the meta-analysis considered the use of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam and not other benzodiazepines. The authors considered case-control and cohort studies separately. The data from the cohort studies did not suggest an increased risk for major malformations (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.35) or for oral cleft (OR 1.19; 95% CI 0.34 to 4.15). The data from the case-control studies suggested an association between benzodiazepines and major malformations (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.32 to 6.84) and oral cleft (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.82). The limitations of this meta-analysis included the small number of reports included in the analysis, and that most cases for analyses of both oral cleft and major malformations came from only three studies. A follow up to that meta-analysis included 3 new cohort studies that examined risk for major malformations and one study that considered cardiac malformations. The authors found no new studies with an outcome of oral clefts. After the addition of the new studies, the odds ratio for major malformations with first trimester exposure to benzodiazepines was 1.07 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.25).<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Neonatal Withdrawal and Floppy Infant Syndrome</span></span><br/>
Neonatal withdrawal syndrome and symptoms suggestive of floppy infant syndrome associated with administration of clobazam during the later stages of pregnancy and peripartum period have been reported in the postmarketing experience. Findings in published scientific literature suggest that the major neonatal side effects of benzodiazepines include sedation and dependence with withdrawal signs. Data from observational studies suggest that fetal exposure to benzodiazepines is associated with the neonatal adverse events of hypotonia, respiratory problems, hypoventilation, low Apgar score, and neonatal withdrawal syndrome.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Animal Data</span><br/>
In a study in which clobazam (0, 150, 450, or 750 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to pregnant rats throughout the period of organogenesis, embryofetal mortality and incidences of fetal skeletal variations were increased at all doses. The low-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (150 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) for clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, lower than those in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg/day.<br/>
Oral administration of clobazam (0, 10, 30, or 75 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weights, and increased incidences of fetal malformations (visceral and skeletal) at the mid and high doses, and an increase in embryofetal mortality at the high dose. Incidences of fetal variations were increased at all doses. The highest dose tested was associated with maternal toxicity (ataxia and decreased activity). The low-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbits (10 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma exposures for clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam lower than those in humans at the MRHD.<br/>
Oral administration of clobazam (0, 50, 350, or 750 mg/kg/day) to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in increased embryofetal mortality at the high dose, decreased pup survival at the mid and high doses and alterations in offspring behavior (locomotor activity) at all doses. The low-effect dose for adverse effects on pre- and postnatal development in rats (50 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma exposures for clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam lower than those in humans at the MRHD.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
Clobazam is excreted in human milk. Postmarketing experience suggests that breastfed infants of mothers taking benzodiazepines, such as clobazam, may have effects of lethargy, somnolence and poor sucking. The effect of clobazam on milk production is unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for clobazam and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from clobazam or from the underlying maternal condition. If exposing a breastfed infant to clobazam, observe for any potential adverse effects.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Monitoring for Adverse Reactions</span><br/>
Adverse reactions such as somnolence and difficulty feeding have been reported in infants during breastfeeding in postmarketing experience with clobazam. Monitor breastfed infants for possible sedation and poor sucking.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Data</span><br/>
Scientific literature on clobazam use during lactation is limited. After short-term administration, clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam are transferred into breast milk.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Administration of clobazam to rats prior to and during mating and early gestation resulted in adverse effects on fertility and early embryonic development at plasma exposures for clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, below those in humans at the MRHD <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].<br/></span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in patients less than 2 years of age have not been established.<br/>
In a study in which clobazam (0, 4, 36, or 120 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to rats during the juvenile period of development (postnatal days 14 to 48), adverse effects on growth (decreased bone density and bone length) and behavior (altered motor activity and auditory startle response; learning deficit) were observed at the high dose. The effect on bone density, but not on behavior, was reversible when drug was discontinued. The no-effect level for juvenile toxicity (36 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) to clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, less than those expected at therapeutic doses in pediatric patients.<br/>
<br/>
</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of clobazam did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, elderly subjects appear to eliminate clobazam more slowly than younger subjects based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. For these reasons, the initial dose in elderly patients should be 5 mg/day. Patients should be titrated initially to 10 mg to 20 mg/day. Patients may be titrated further to a maximum daily dose of 40 mg if tolerated <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizers</h3><p class="First">Concentrations of clobazam’s active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, are higher in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers. For this reason, dosage modification is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<br/></span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of clobazam were evaluated in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. There were no significant differences in systemic exposure (AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) between patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. There is essentially no experience with clobazam in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD. It is not known if clobazam or its active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, is dialyzable <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<br/></span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Clobazam is hepatically metabolized; however, there are limited data to characterize the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clobazam. For this reason, dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 9). There is inadequate information about metabolism of clobazam in patients with severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<br/></span></p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Clobazam Oral Suspension contains clobazam which is a Schedule IV controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Clobazam can be abused in a similar manner as other benzodiazepines, such as diazepam.<br/>
<br/>
The pharmacological profile of clobazam is similar to that of other benzodiazepines listed in Schedule IV of the Controlled Substance Act, particularly in its potentiation of GABAergic transmission through its action on GABAA receptors, which leads to sedation and somnolence.<br/>
<br/>
The World Health Organization epidemiology database contains reports of drug abuse, misuse, and overdoses associated with clobazam.<br/>
<br/>
Drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, repeatedly or even sporadically, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dependence</span><br/>
Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood levels of the drug, and/or administration of an antagonist. In clinical trials, cases of dependency were reported following abrupt discontinuation of Clobazam Oral Suspension.<br/>
<br/>
The risk of dependence is present even with use of Clobazam Oral Suspension at the recommended dose range over periods of only a few weeks. The risk of dependence increases with increasing dose and duration of treatment. The risk of dependence is increased in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Withdrawal</span><br/>
Abrupt discontinuation of Clobazam Oral Suspension causes withdrawal symptoms. As with other benzodiazepines, clobazam should be withdrawn gradually <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span><br/>
<br/>
In clobazam clinical pharmacology trials in healthy volunteers, the most common withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation were headache, tremor, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, drug withdrawal syndrome, palpitations, and diarrhea <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span><br/>
<br/>
Other withdrawal reactions to clobazam reported in the literature include restlessness, panic attacks, profuse sweating, difficulty in concentrating, nausea and dry retching, weight loss, blurred vision, photophobia, and muscle pain and stiffness. In general, benzodiazepine withdrawal may cause seizures, psychosis, and hallucinations <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].<br/></span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Signs and Symptoms of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">Overdose and intoxication with benzodiazepines, including clobazam, may lead to CNS depression, associated with drowsiness, confusion and lethargy, possibly progressing to ataxia, respiratory depression, hypotension, and, rarely, coma or death. The risk of a fatal outcome is increased in cases of combined poisoning with other CNS depressants, including opioids and alcohol.</p><h3>Management of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">The management of clobazam overdose may include gastric lavage and/or administration of activated charcoal, intravenous fluid replenishment, early control of airway and general supportive measures, in addition to monitoring level of consciousness and vital signs. Hypotension can be treated by replenishment with plasma substitutes and, if necessary, with sympathomimetic agents.<br/>
<br/>
The efficacy of supplementary administration of physostigmine (a cholinergic agent) or of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) in clobazam overdose has not been assessed. The administration of flumazenil in cases of benzodiazepine overdose can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions. Its use in patients with epilepsy is typically not recommended.</p><h2>Clobazam Oral Suspension Description</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Table 4. Description<br/></span></p><p>Clobazam is a white or almost white crystalline powder; is freely soluble in dichloromethane. The melting range of clobazam is from 182ºC to 185ºC. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">16</span>H<span class="Sub">13</span>ClN<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span> and the molecular weight is 300.74.<br/>
<br/>
Clobazam is available for oral administration as an off white suspension containing clobazam at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. Inactive ingredients include citric acid monohydrate, dibasic sodium phosphate anhydrous, magnesium aluminum silicate, maltitol solution, methylparaben, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, propyl paraben, purified water, simethicone emulsion, strawberry flavor, sucralose and xanthan gum.</p><h2>Clobazam Oral Suspension - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The exact mechanism of action for clobazam, a 1,5-benzodiazepine, is not fully understood but is thought to involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission resulting from binding at the benzodiazepine site of the GABA<span class="Sub">A </span>receptor.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on Electrocardiogram</span><br/>
The effect of clobazam 20 mg and 80 mg administered twice daily on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, evaluator-blinded, placebo-, and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) parallel thorough QT study in 280 healthy subjects. In a study with demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on the Fridericia correction method was below 10 ms, the threshold for regulatory concern. Thus, at a dose two times the maximum recommended dose, clobazam did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The peak plasma levels (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and the area under the curve (AUC) of clobazam are dose-proportional over the dose range of 10 mg to 80 mg following single- or multiple-dose administration of clobazam. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the pharmacokinetics of clobazam are linear from 5 mg to 160 mg/day. Clobazam is converted to N-desmethylclobazam which has about 1/5 the activity of clobazam. The estimated mean elimination half-lives (t<span class="Sub">½</span>) of clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam were 36 to 42 hours and 71 to 82 hours, respectively.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Absorption</span><br/>
Clobazam is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration. The time to peak concentrations (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) of clobazam tablets under fasted conditions ranged from 0.5 to 4 hours after single- or multiple-dose administrations. The relative bioavailability of clobazam tablets compared to an oral solution is approximately 100%. After single dose administration of the oral suspension under fasted conditions, the T<span class="Sub">max</span> ranged from 0.5 to 2 hours. Based on exposure (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC) of clobazam, clobazam tablets and suspension were shown to have similar bioavailability under fasted conditions. The administration of clobazam tablets with food or when crushed in applesauce does not affect absorption. Although not studied, the oral bioavailability of the oral suspension is unlikely to be affected under fed conditions.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Distribution</span><br/>
Clobazam is lipophilic and distributes rapidly throughout the body. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state was approximately 100 L. The <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> plasma protein binding of clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam is approximately 80 to 90% and 70%, respectively.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Metabolism and Excretion</span><br/>
Clobazam is extensively metabolized in the liver, with approximately 2% of the dose recovered in urine and 1% in feces as unchanged drug. The major metabolic pathway of clobazam involves N-demethylation, primarily by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and CYP2B6. N-desmethylclobazam, an active metabolite, is the major circulating metabolite in humans, and at therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations are 3 to 5 times higher than those of the parent compound. Based on animal and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> receptor binding data, estimates of the relative potency of N-desmethylclobazam compared to parent compound range from 1/5 to equal potency. N-desmethylclobazam is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP2C19. N-desmethylclobazam and its metabolites comprise ~94% of the total drug-related components in urine. Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled drug, approximately 11% of the dose was excreted in the feces and approximately 82% was excreted in the urine.<br/>
The polymorphic CYP2C19 is the major contributor to the metabolism of the pharmacologically active N-desmethylclobazam <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]</span>. In CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, levels of N-desmethylclobazam were 5-fold higher in plasma and 2- to 3-fold higher in the urine than in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Age</span><br/>
Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the clearance of clobazam is lower in elderly subjects compared to other age groups (ages 2 to 64). Dosing should be adjusted in the elderly <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Sex</span><br/>
Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed no difference in the clearance of clobazam between women and men.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Race</span><br/>
Population pharmacokinetic analyses including Caucasian (75%), African American (15%), and Asian (9%) subjects showed that there is no evidence of clinically significant effect of race on the clearance of clobazam.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span><br/>
The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clobazam was evaluated in patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CL<span class="Sub">CR</span>] &gt;50 to 80 mL/min; N=6) and moderate (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span>=30 to 50 mL/min; N=6) renal dysfunction, with matching healthy controls (N=6), following administration of multiple doses of clobazam 20 mg/day. There were insignificant changes in Cmax (3 to 24%) and AUC (≤13%) for clobazam or N-desmethylclobazam in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. Patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD were not included in this study.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span><br/>
There are limited data to characterize the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clobazam. In a small study, the pharmacokinetics of a 20 mg single oral dose of clobazam in 9 patients with liver impairment were compared to healthy controls (N=6). The C<span class="Sub">max</span> and the mean plasma clearance of clobazam, as well as the C<span class="Sub">max</span> of N-desmethylclobazam, showed no significant change compared to the healthy controls. The AUC values of N-desmethylclobazam in these patients were not available. Adjust dosage in patients with hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].<br/></span> <br/>
<span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span><br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">In vitro studies:</span></span><br/>
Clobazam did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, or UGT2B4 <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. N-desmethylclobazam showed weak inhibition of CYP2C9, UGT1A4, UGT1A6 and UGT2B4.<br/>
Clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam did not significantly increase CYP1A2 or CYP2C19 activities, but did induce CYP3A4 activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam also increased UGT1A1 mRNA but at concentrations much higher than therapeutic levels. The potential for clobazam or N-desmethylclobazam to induce CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 has not been evaluated.<br/>
Clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam do not inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but are P-gp substrates.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">In vivo studies:</span></span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Potential for Clobazam to Affect Other Drugs</span><br/>
The effect of repeated 40 mg once-daily doses of clobazam on the pharmacokinetic profiles of single-dose dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), and tolbutamide (CYP2C9 substrate), was studied when these probe substrates were given as a drug cocktail (N=18).<br/>
Clobazam increased AUC and Cmax of dextromethorphan by 90% and 59%, respectively, reflecting its inhibition of CYP2D6 <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>. Drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 may require dose adjustment when used with clobazam. <br/>
Clobazam decreased the AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of midazolam by 27% and 24%, respectively, and increased the AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of the metabolite 1-hydroxymidazolam by 4-fold and 2-fold, respectively. This level of induction does not call for dosage adjustment of drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 when used concomitantly with clobazam. Some hormonal contraceptives are metabolized by CYP3A4 and their effectiveness may be diminished when given with clobazam <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>. Repeated clobazam doses had no effect on caffeine and tolbutamide.  <br/>
A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated clobazam did not affect the exposure of valproic acid (a CYP2C9/2C19 substrate) or lamotrigine (a UGT substrate).<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clobazam</span><br/>
Co-administration of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) 400 mg once-daily for 5 days increased clobazam AUC by 54%, with an insignificant effect on clobazam C<span class="Sub">max</span>. There was no significant change in AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of N-desmethylclobazam (N=18).<br/>
Strong (e.g., fluconazole, fluvoxamine, ticlopidine) and moderate (e.g., omeprazole) inhibitors of CYP2C19 may result in up to a 5-fold increase in exposure to N-desmethylclobazam, the active metabolite of clobazam, based on extrapolation from pharmacogenomic data <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].</span> Dosage adjustment of clobazam may be necessary when co-administered with strong or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.4)].</span><br/>
The effects of concomitant antiepileptic drugs that are CYP3A4 inducers (phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine), CYP2C19 inducers (valproic acid, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine), and CYP2C19 inhibitors (felbamate and oxcarbazepine) were evaluated using data from clinical trials. Results of population pharmacokinetic analysis show that these concomitant antiepileptic drugs did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of clobazam or     N-desmethylclobazam at steady-state.<br/>
Alcohol has been reported to increase the maximum plasma exposure of clobazam by approximately 50%. Alcohol may have additive CNS depressant effects when taken with clobazam <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.2)].</span></p><h3>Pharmacogenomics</h3><p class="First">The polymorphic CYP2C19 is the main enzyme that metabolizes the pharmacologically active N-desmethylclobazam. Compared to CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers, N-desmethylclobazam AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> are approximately 3 to 5 times higher in poor metabolizers (e.g., subjects with *2/*2 genotype) and 2 times higher in intermediate metabolizers (e.g., subjects with *1/*2 genotype). The prevalence of CYP2C19 poor metabolism differs depending on racial/ethnic background. Dosage in patients who are known CYP2C19 poor metabolizers may need to be adjusted <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].<br/></span> <br/>
The systemic exposure of clobazam is similar for both CYP2C19 poor and extensive metabolizers.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span><br/>
In mice, oral administration of clobazam (0, 6, 12, or 24 mg/kg/day) for 2 years did not result in an increase in tumors. The highest dose tested was approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg/day, based on body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).<br/>
In rats, oral administration of clobazam for 2 years resulted in increases in tumors of the thyroid gland (follicular cell adenoma and carcinoma) and liver (hepatocellular adenoma) at the mid and high doses. The low dose, not associated with an increase in tumors, was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) for clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, less than that in humans at the MRHD.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span><br/>
Clobazam and the major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, were negative for genotoxicity, based on data from a battery of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> (bacteria reverse mutation, mammalian clastogenicity) and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> (mouse micronucleus) assays.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span><br/>
In a fertility study in which clobazam (50, 350, or 750 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 12, 84 and 181 times the oral Maximum Recommended Human Dose, MRHD, of 40 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface) was orally administered to male and female rats prior to and during mating and continuing in females to gestation day 6, increases in abnormal sperm and pre-implantation loss were observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect level for fertility and early embryonic development in rats was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) for clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, less than those in humans at the maximum recommended human dose of 40 mg/day.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The effectiveness of clobazam for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was established in two multicenter controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2). Both studies were similar in terms of disease characteristics and concomitant AED treatments. The most common concomitant AED treatments at baseline included: valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and topiramate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Study 1</span><br/>
Study 1 (N=238) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study consisting of a 4-week baseline period followed by a 3-week titration period and 12-week maintenance period. Patients age 2 to 54 years with a current or prior diagnosis of LGS were stratified into 2 weight groups (12.5 kg to ≤30 kg or &gt;30 kg) and then randomized to placebo or one of three target maintenance doses of clobazam according to Table 5.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Table 5. Study 1 Total Daily Dose<br/></span></p><p>Doses above 5 mg/day were administered in two divided doses.<br/>
<br/>
The primary efficacy measure was the percent reduction in the weekly frequency of drop seizures (atonic, tonic, or myoclonic), also known as drop attacks, from the 4-week baseline period to 12-week maintenance period.<br/>
The pre-dosing baseline mean weekly drop seizure frequency was 98, 100, 61, and 105 for the placebo, low-, medium-, and high-dose groups, respectively. Figure 1 presents the mean percent reduction in weekly drop seizures from this baseline. All dose groups of clobazam were statistically superior (p≤0.05) to the placebo group.
