Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Diagnostic agent for pancreatic function</b>: Limited data available: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 0.2 mcg/kg as single dose over 1 minute (Horvath 2016)</p><p><b>Diagnostic agent for gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison):</b> Limited data available: Adolescents ≥15 years: IV: 0.4 mcg/kg as single dose over 1 minute (Berna 2006). Dosing based on experience with the porcine product; a conversion of 1 unit = 0.2 mcg of human synthetic product has been suggested by the manufacturer.</p><p><b>Facilitation of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography visualization</b>: Limited data available: Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: 0.2 mcg/kg as a single dose over 1 minute; maximum dose: 16 mcg/dose (Delaney 2008; Trout 2013)</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Add 8 mL NS to the 16 mcg vial to yield concentration of 2 mcg/mL; add 10 mL NS to the 40 mcg vial to yield a concentration of 4 mcg/mL; shake vigorously to ensure dissolution and use immediately. Discard any unused product. </p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IV: Administer by IV injection slowly over 1 minute.</p><h2>Dietary Considerations</h2><p>Patients should fast 12 to 15 hours prior to beginning the test.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Prior to reconstitution, store at -20°C (-4°F). Protect from light.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Anticholinergic Agents: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Secretin. Management: Avoid concomitant use of anticholinergic agents and secretin. Discontinue anticholinergic agents at least 5 half-lives prior to administration of secretin.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Histamine H2 Receptor Antagonists: May diminish the diagnostic effect of Secretin. Specifically, use of H2-Antagonists may cause a hyperresponse in gastrin secretion in response to secretin stimulation testing, falsely suggesting gastrinoma. Management: Avoid concomitant use of histamine H2-antagonists (H2RAs) and secretin. Discontinue H2RAs at least 2 days prior to secretin administration.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Proton Pump Inhibitors: May diminish the diagnostic effect of Secretin. Specifically, use of PPIs may cause a hyperresponse in gastrin secretion in response to secretin stimulation testing, falsely suggesting gastrinoma. Management: Avoid concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and secretin, and discontinue PPIs several weeks prior to secretin administration, with the duration of separation determined by the specific PPI. See full monograph for details.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>1% to 10%: Gastrointestinal: Nausea (2%)</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Abdominal distress, flushing, vomiting</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment (including ethanol-induced disease); may be hyperresponsive to secretin stimulation and mask the presence of coexisting pancreatic disease. Consider additional testing and clinical assessments to aid in diagnosis.</p><p>• Inflammatory bowel disease: Patients who have inflammatory bowel disease may be hyporesponsive to secretin stimulation falsely suggesting pancreatic disease; consider additional testing and clinical assessments for aid in diagnosis.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Vagotomy: Patients who have undergone vagotomy may be hyporesponsive to secretin stimulation falsely suggesting pancreatic disease; consider additional testing and clinical assessments for aid in diagnosis.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Peak bicarbonate concentration of duodenal fluid aspirate (chronic pancreatitis); serum gastrin (gastrinoma). Refer to protocols for collection of pancreatic secretion and/or serum gastrin.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to see if the pancreas is working the right way.</p><p>• It is used to see if there is a tumor in the pancreas or bowel.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects. However, many people have no side effects or only have minor side effects. Call your doctor or get medical help if any of these side effects or any other side effects bother you or do not go away:</b></p><p>• Abdominal pain</p><p>• Flushing</p><p>• Vomiting</p><p>• Nausea</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
