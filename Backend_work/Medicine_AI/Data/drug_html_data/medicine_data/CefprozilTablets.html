</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Rx Only</span></p><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefprozil Tablets and other antibacterial drugs, Cefprozil Tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.</p><h2>Cefprozil Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Cefprozil is a semi-synthetic broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic. Cefprozil is a cis and trans isomeric mixture (≥90% cis). The chemical name for the monohydrate is (<span class="Italics">6R</span>, <span class="Italics">7R</span>)-7-[(<span class="Italics">R</span>)-2-Amino-2-(<span class="Italics">p</span>-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-8- oxo-3-propenyl-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid monohydrate, and the structural formula is:</p><p>Cefprozil is a white to yellowish powder with a molecular formula for the monohydrate of C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">19</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">5</span>S•H<span class="Sub">2</span>O and a molecular weight of 407.45.</p><p>Cefprozil Tablets are intended for oral administration.</p><p>Cefprozil Tablets contain cefprozil equivalent to 250 mg or 500 mg of anhydrous cefprozil. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, methylcellulose, sodium starch glycolate, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, hypromellose, and titanium dioxide.</p><h2>Cefprozil Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The pharmacokinetic data were derived from the capsule formulation; however, bioequivalence has been demonstrated for the oral solution, capsule, tablet, and suspension formulations under fasting conditions.</p><p>Following oral administration of cefprozil to fasting subjects, approximately 95% of the dose was absorbed. The average plasma half-life in normal subjects was 1.3 hours, while the steady-state volume of distribution was estimated to be 0.23 L/kg. The total body clearance and renal clearance rates were approximately 3 mL/min/kg and 2.3 mL/min/kg, respectively.</p><p>Average peak plasma concentrations after administration of 250 mg, 500 mg, or 1 g doses of cefprozil to fasting subjects were approximately 6.1, 10.5, and 18.3 mcg/mL, respectively, and were obtained within 1.5 hours after dosing. Urinary recovery accounted for approximately 60% of the administered dose. (See Table.)</p><p class="First Footnote">*Data represent mean values of 12 healthy volunteers.</p><p>During the first 4-hour period after drug administration, the average urine concentrations following 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1 g doses were approximately 700 mcg/mL, 1000 mcg/mL, and 2900 mcg/mL, respectively.</p><p>Administration of Cefprozil tablet formulation with food did not affect the extent of absorption (AUC) or the peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of cefprozil. However, there was an increase of 0.25 to 0.75 hours in the time to maximum plasma concentration of cefprozil (T<span class="Sub">max</span>).</p><p>The bioavailability of the capsule formulation of cefprozil was not affected when administered 5 minutes following an antacid.</p><p>Plasma protein binding is approximately 36% and is independent of concentration in the range of 2 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL.</p><p>There was no evidence of accumulation of cefprozil in the plasma in individuals with normal renal function following multiple oral doses of up to 1000 mg every 8 hours for 10 days.</p><p>In patients with reduced renal function, the plasma half-life may be prolonged up to 5.2 hours depending on the degree of the renal dysfunction. In patients with complete absence of renal function, the plasma half-life of cefprozil has been shown to be as long as 5.9 hours. The half-life is shortened during hemodialysis. Excretion pathways in patients with markedly impaired renal function have not been determined. (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>.)</p><p>In patients with impaired hepatic function, the half-life increases to approximately 2 hours. The magnitude of the changes does not warrant a dosage adjustment for patients with impaired hepatic function.</p><p>Healthy geriatric volunteers (≥65 years old) who received a single 1-g dose of cefprozil had 35% to 60% higher AUC and 40% lower renal clearance values compared with healthy adult volunteers 20 to 40 years of age. The average AUC in young and elderly female subjects was approximately 15 to 20% higher than in young and elderly male subjects. The magnitude of these age- and gender-related changes in the pharmacokinetics of cefprozil is not sufficient to necessitate dosage adjustments.</p><p>Adequate data on CSF levels of cefprozil are not available.</p><p>Comparable pharmacokinetic parameters of cefprozil are observed between pediatric patients (6 months to 12 years) and adults following oral administration of selected matched doses. The maximum concentrations are achieved at 1 to 2 hours after dosing. The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 1.5 hours. In general, the observed plasma concentrations of cefprozil in pediatric patients at the 7.5, 15, and 30 mg/kg doses are similar to those observed within the same time frame in normal adult subjects at the 250, 500, and 1000 mg doses, respectively. The comparative plasma concentrations of cefprozil in pediatric patients and adult subjects at the equivalent dose level are presented in the table below.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span>n=11; <span class="Sup">b</span>n=5; <span class="Sup">c</span>n=9; <span class="Sup">d</span>n=11</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">Cefprozil has <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> activity against a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The bactericidal action of cefprozil results from inhibition of cell-wall synthesis. Cefprozil has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections as described in the <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span> section.</p><p>The following <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> data are available; however, their clinical significance is unknown. Cefprozil exhibits <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 8 mcg/mL or less against most (≥90%) strains of the following microorganisms; however, the safety and effectiveness of cefprozil in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold">            NOTE:</span> Cefprozil is inactive against <span class="Italics">Enterococcus faecium</span> .</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold">            NOTE:</span> Cefprozil is inactive against most strains of <span class="Italics">Acinetobacter, Enterobacter,   Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia, Pseudomonas,</span> and <span class="Italics">Serratia.</span></p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold">            NOTE:</span> Most strains of the <span class="Italics">Bacteroides fragilis</span> group are resistant to cefprozil.</p><p><span class="Italics">Susceptibility Tests</span></p><p>For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Cefprozil Tablets</h2><p class="First">Cefprozil Tablets are indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below:</p><h3>UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharyngitis/tonsillitis</span> caused by <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span>.</p><p>NOTE: The usual drug of choice in the treatment and prevention of streptococcal infections, including the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever, is penicillin given by the intramuscular route. Cefprozil is generally effective in the eradication of <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span> from the nasopharynx; however, substantial data establishing the efficacy of cefprozil in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available at present.</p><p><span class="Bold">Otitis Media</span> caused by <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae,</span> <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span> (including β-lactamase-producing strains), and <span class="Italics">Moraxella  (Branhamella) catarrhalis</span> (including β-lactamase-producing strains). (See <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES</span>.)</p><p>NOTE: In the treatment of otitis media due to β-lactamase producing organisms, cefprozil had bacteriologic eradication rates somewhat lower than those  observed with a product containing a specific β-lactamase inhibitor. In considering the use of cefprozil, lower overall eradication rates should be balanced against the susceptibility patterns of the common microbes in a given geographic area and the increased potential for toxicity with products containing β-lactamase inhibitors.</p><p><span class="Bold">Acute Sinusitis</span> caused by <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae</span> (including β-lactamase-producing strains), and <span class="Italics">Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis</span> (including β-lactamase-producing strains).</p><h3>LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis</span> caused by <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae</span> (including β-lactamase-producing strains), and <span class="Italics">Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis</span> (including β-lactamase-producing strains).</p><h3>SKIN AND SKIN STRUCTURE</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Uncomplicated Skin and Skin-Structure Infections</span> caused by <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (including penicillinase-producing strains) and <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span>. Abscesses usually require surgical drainage.</p><p>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefprozil Tablets and other antibacterial drugs, Cefprozil Tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Cefprozil is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to the cephalosporin class of antibiotics.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">BEFORE THERAPY WITH CEFPROZIL IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEFPROZIL, CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. IF THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS-SENSITIVITY AMONG β-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFPROZIL OCCURS, DISCONTINUE THE DRUG. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, INTRAVENOUS ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefprozil, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C.</span> <span class="Italics">difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C.</span> <span class="Italics">difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Prescribing cefprozil in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><p>In patients with known or suspected renal impairment (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>), careful clinical observation and appropriate laboratory studies should be done prior to and during therapy. The total daily dose of cefprozil should be reduced in these patients because high and/or prolonged plasma antibiotic concentrations can occur in such individuals from usual doses. Cephalosporins, including cefprozil, should be given with caution to patients receiving concurrent treatment with potent diuretics since these agents are suspected of adversely affecting renal function.</p><p>Prolonged use of cefprozil may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.</p><p>Cefprozil should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease particularly colitis.</p><p>Positive direct Coombs' tests have been reported during treatment with cephalosporin antibiotics.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including cefprozil should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (eg, the common cold). When cefprozil is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cefprozil or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporin antibiotics. Concomitant administration of probenecid doubled the AUC for cefprozil.</p><p>The bioavailability of the capsule formulation of cefprozil was not affected when administered 5 minutes following an antacid.</p><h3>Drug/laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">Cephalosporin antibiotics may produce a false positive reaction for glucose in the urine with copper reduction tests (Benedict's or Fehling's solution or with Clinitest<span class="Sup">®</span> tablets<span class="Sup">1</span>), but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria (e.g., Clinistix<span class="Sup">®</span>). A false negative reaction may occur in the ferricyanide test for blood glucose. The presence of cefprozil in the blood does not interfere with the assay of plasma or urine creatinine by the alkaline picrate method.</p><p>___________________________________</p><p><span class="Sup">1</span> Clinitest<span class="Sup">®</span> and Clinistix<span class="Sup">®</span> are registered trademarks of Bayer Healthcare LLC.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long term <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of cefprozil.</p><p>Cefprozil was not found to be mutagenic in either the Ames <span class="Italics">Salmonella</span> or <span class="Italics">E. coli</span> WP2 urvA reversion assays or the Chinese hamster ovary cell HGPRT forward gene mutation assay and it did not induce chromosomal abnormalities in Chinese hamster ovary cells or unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes <span class="Italics">in  vitro</span>. Chromosomal aberrations were not observed in bone marrow cells from rats dosed orally with over 30 times the highest recommended human dose based upon mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.</p><p>Impairment of fertility was not observed in male or female rats given oral doses of cefprozil up to 18.5 times the highest recommended human dose based upon mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category B</span></p><p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits, mice, and rats using oral doses of cefprozil of 0.8, 8.5, and 18.5 times the maximum daily human dose (1000 mg) based upon mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, and have revealed no harm to the fetus. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">Cefprozil has not been studied for use during labor and delivery. Treatment should only be given if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Small amounts of cefprozil (&lt;0.3% of dose) have been detected in human milk following administration of a single 1 gram dose to lactating women. The average levels over 24 hours ranged from 0.25 to 3.3 mcg/mL. Caution should be exercised when cefprozil is administered to a nursing woman, since the effect of cefprozil on nursing infants is unknown.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">(See <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.</span>)</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of cefprozil in the treatment of otitis media have been established in the age groups 6 months to 12 years. Use of cefprozil for the treatment of otitis media is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of cefprozil in pediatric patients. (See <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES</span>.)</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of cefprozil in the treatment of pharyngitis/tonsillitis or uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections have been established in the age groups 2 to 12 years. Use of cefprozil for the treatment of these infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of cefprozil in pediatric patients.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of cefprozil in the treatment of acute sinusitis have been established in the age groups 6 months to 12 years. Use of cefprozil in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of cefprozil in adults.</p><p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established for the treatment of otitis media or acute sinusitis, or below the age of 2 years for the treatment of pharyngitis/tonsillitis or uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections. However, accumulation of other cephalosporin antibiotics in newborn infants (resulting from prolonged drug half-life in this age group) has been reported.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the more than 4500 adults treated with cefprozil in clinical studies, 14% were 65 years and older, while 5% were 75 years and older. When geriatric patients received the usual recommended adult doses, their clinical efficacy and safety were comparable to clinical efficacy and safety in nongeriatric adult patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to the effects of cefprozil cannot be excluded (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>).</p><p>Cefprozil is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function. See <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span> for dosing recommendations for patients with impaired renal function.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The adverse reactions to cefprozil are similar to those observed with other orally administered cephalosporins. Cefprozil was usually well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. Approximately 2% of patients discontinued cefprozil therapy due to adverse events.</p><p>The most common adverse effects observed in patients treated with cefprozil are:</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal:</span> Diarrhea (2.9%), nausea (3.5%), vomiting (1%), and abdominal pain (1%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatobiliary:</span> Elevations of AST (SGOT) (2%), ALT (SGPT) (2%), alkaline phosphatase (0.2%), and bilirubin values (&lt;0.1%). As with some penicillins and some other cephalosporin antibiotics, cholestatic jaundice has been reported rarely.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hypersensitivity:</span> Rash (0.9%), urticaria (0.1%). Such reactions have been reported more frequently in children than in adults. Signs and symptoms usually occur a few days after initiation of therapy and subside within a few days after cessation of therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">CNS:</span> Dizziness (1%), hyperactivity, headache, nervousness, insomnia, confusion, and somnolence have been reported rarely (&lt;1%). All were reversible.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hematopoietic:</span> Decreased leukocyte count (0.2%), eosinophilia (2.3%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal:</span> Elevated BUN (0.1%), serum creatinine (0.1%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Other:</span> Diaper rash and superinfection (1.5%), genital pruritus and vaginitis (1.6%).</p><p>The following adverse events, regardless of established causal relationship to cefprozil, have been rarely reported during postmarketing surveillance: anaphylaxis, angioedema, colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis), erythema multiforme, fever, serumsickness like reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and thrombocytopenia.</p><h3>Cephalosporin class paragraph</h3><p class="First">In addition to the adverse reactions listed above which have been observed in patients treated with cefprozil, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics:</p><p>Aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, renal dysfunction, toxic epidermal necrolysis, toxic nephropathy, prolonged prothrombin time, positive Coomb's test, elevated LDH, pancytopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis.</p><p>Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment, when the dosage was not reduced. (See <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span> and <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span>.) If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Single 5000 mg/kg oral doses of cefprozil caused no mortality or signs of toxicity in adult, weanling, or neonatal rats, or adult mice. A single oral dose of 3000 mg/kg caused diarrhea and loss of appetite in cynomolgus monkeys, but no mortality.</p><p>Cefprozil is eliminated primarily by the kidneys. In case of severe overdosage, especially in patients with compromised renal function, hemodialysis will aid in the removal of cefprozil from the body.</p><h2>Cefprozil Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Cefprozil Tablets are administered orally.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> In the treatment of infections due to <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span> , Cefprozil Tablets should be administered for at least 10 days.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">b</span> Not to exceed recommended adult doses.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Cefprozil may be administered to patients with impaired renal function. The following dosage schedule should be used.</p><p class="First Footnote">*Cefprozil is in part removed by hemodialysis; therefore, cefprozil should be administered after the completion of hemodialysis.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with impaired hepatic function.</p><h2>How is Cefprozil Tablets Supplied</h2><p class="First">Cefprozil Tablets USP</p><p>Each white film-coated, capsule shaped tablet, debossed with "W712" on one side and plain on other side, contains the equivalent of 250 mg anhydrous cefprozil.</p><p>Bottles of 50 Tablets                                 <span class="Bold">NDC</span> 64679-712-01</p><p>Bottles of 1000 Tablets                      <span class="Bold">NDC</span> 64679-712-02</p><p>Bottles of 100 Tablets                                 <span class="Bold">NDC</span> 64679-712-03</p><p>Bottles of 500 Tablets                                 <span class="Bold">NDC</span> 64679-712-04</p><p>Each white film-coated, capsule shaped tablet, debossed with "W713" on one side and plain on other side, contains the equivalent of 500 mg anhydrous cefprozil.</p><p>Bottles of 50 Tablets                                 <span class="Bold">NDC</span> 64679-713-01</p><p>Bottles of 500 Tablets                                 <span class="Bold">NDC</span> 64679-713-02</p><p>Bottles of 100 Tablets                                 <span class="Bold">NDC</span> 64679-713-03</p><p>Store between 20° and 25°C (68° and 77°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Study One:</h3><p class="First">In a controlled clinical study of <span class="Bold">acute otitis media</span> performed in the United States where significant rates of β-lactamase-producing organisms were found, cefprozil was compared to an oral antimicrobial agent that contained a specific β-lactamase inhibitor.
