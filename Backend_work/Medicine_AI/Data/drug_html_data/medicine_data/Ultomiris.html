Monoclonal antibodies are man-made antibodies that fight antigens (harmful substances) in the body.</p><p>Ultomiris injection is used to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) in adults.</p><p>PNH is a rare genetic disorder in which defective red blood cells break down prematurely and leak hemoglobin into your blood. Hemoglobin is the iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. When hemoglobin passes into your urine, it can appear dark or tea-colored (especially in the morning or after sleep, when the urine is most concentrated).</p><p>Ultomiris is also used to treat a rare chronic blood disease called hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) in adults and children who are at least 1 month old. This medicine is <b>not for use</b> in treating HUS that is related to Shiga toxin E. coli.</p><p>Ultomiris is available only under a special program. You must be registered in the program and understand the risks and benefits of this medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Ultomiris affects your immune system. <b>You may get infections more easily, even serious or fatal infections.</b> Call your doctor if you have a fever, flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, headache, confusion, neck or back stiffness, vomiting, rash, or your eyes are more sensitive to light.</p><p>You will need to receive certain vaccinations before you start using Ultomiris.</p><p>Ultomiris comes with a Patient Safety Card listing symptoms of meningococcal infection. Keep this card with you at all times while using Ultomiris and for at least 8 months after your last dose. Your infection risk could last for several months after you stop using Ultomiris.</p><p>Some people may have an increased risk of gonorrhea (a sexually transmitted disease) while using this medicine. Talk with your doctor about safe ways to keep from getting an infection during sex.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with Ultomiris if you are allergic to ravulizumab, or if you have a meningococcal infection (such as meningitis or sepsis) or if you are not currently vaccinated against meningitis (unless the risks of delaying treatment outweigh the risks of developing meningitis).</p><p>You will need to receive a vaccine to protect against meningococcal infections at least 2 weeks before you start using Ultomiris. If your child is treated with Ultomiris, make sure he or she is vaccinated against pneumonia and influenza type B (Hib).</p><p>If you need to start receiving this medicine before you are vaccinated, you may be given antibiotic medicine to take during the first 2 weeks of Ultomiris treatment.</p><p>To make sure Ultomiris is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>never received a meningococcal vaccine; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recently had any symptoms of infection (fever, chills, or flu-like symptoms).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>never received a meningococcal vaccine; or</p><p>recently had any symptoms of infection (fever, chills, or flu-like symptoms).</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant. It is not known whether ravulizumab will harm an unborn baby. However, having PNH during pregnancy may cause complications in the baby or the mother, including blood clots, infections, bleeding, miscarriage, premature delivery, or death. The benefit of treating PNH may outweigh any risks to the baby or the mother.</p><p><b>Do not breastfeed while using this medicine,</b> and for at least 8 months after your last dose.</p><p>Ultomiris should not be given to a child younger than 18 years old with PNH.</p><p>Ultomiris is not approved for use by anyone younger than 1 month old with aHUS.</p><h2>How is Ultomiris given?</h2><p>Ultomiris injection is given as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give you this injection. The first two infusions are usually given 2 weeks apart, followed by an infusion once every 8 weeks.</p><p>If you have been using another drug called eculizumab (Soliris), you will need to wait 2 weeks after your last dose of eculizumab before starting treatment with Ultomiris.</p><p>After each infusion, you will be watched closely for at least 1 hour to make sure you do not have an allergic reaction.</p><p>Ravulizumab doses are based on weight. Your dose needs may change if you gain or lose weight.</p><p>Ultomiris affects your immune system. You may get infections more easily, even serious or fatal infections. Your doctor will need to examine you on a regular basis.</p><p>Some people may have an increased risk of gonorrhea (a sexually transmitted disease). Talk with your doctor about safe ways to keep from getting an infection during sex.</p><p>Ravulizumab can have long lasting effects on your body, even after you stop using this medicine. <b>If you have PNH and you stop using Ultomiris,</b> your doctor may need to check your progress for at least 16 weeks after your last dose. <b>If you have aHUS and you stop using Ultomiris,</b> your doctor may need to check you for at least 12 months after your last dose.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have signs of red blood cell breakdown: stomach pain, trouble swallowing, blood in your urine, feeling tired or short of breath, or (in men) trouble having an erection.</p><p><b>If you have aHUS</b>, tell your doctor if you have the following symptoms: confusion or loss of consciousness, seizures, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or stroke.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria:</b></p><p><strong>40 kg to less than 60 kg:</strong><br/>
