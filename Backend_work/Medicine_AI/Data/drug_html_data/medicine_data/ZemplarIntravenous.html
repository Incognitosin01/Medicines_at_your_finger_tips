Hyperparathyroidism is a condition that is caused when the parathyroid glands located in the neck make too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). This hormone controls the concentrations of calcium and phosphorus in your blood. Paricalcitol helps lower the amount of PTH which lowers the calcium and phosphorus concentrations.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Zemplar</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
