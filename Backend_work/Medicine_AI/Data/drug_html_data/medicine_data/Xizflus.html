</ul><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">Xizflus is an orally-administered nutritional product dispensed by prescription for the clinical dietary management of suboptimal hydrogen sulfide levels related to metabolic imbalances in endogenous hydrogen sulfide biochemistry. Use under medical supervision.</p><p><br/>
INGREDIENTS<br/>
Each Xizflus serving contains:<br/>
     Sodium polysulthionate‡     400 mg<br/>
    5-methyltetrahydrofolate     500 mcg</p><p><br/>
<span class="Sup"> ‡ Proprietary matrix of alpha sulfur, sodium sulfate, sodium thiosulfate obtained by reacting sodium hydrosulfide with sodium metabisulfite in an </span><span class="Sup">acidic medium</span></p><h2>INDICATION</h2><p class="First">Xizflus is indicated for the distinct nutritional requirements of certain individuals with suboptimal endogenous hydrogen sulfide levels that cannot be corrected through diet alone, with a particular emphasis in persons who have inborn errors of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), cystathione gamma-lyase (CSE), and/or 3-mercaptopyruvatesulfurtransferase (3-MST). Clinical dietary management in patients who, as a result of a condition or disease, have limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients associated with endogenous hydrogen sulfide biochemistry. Use under medical supervision.<span class="Sup">1-6</span></p><p>In patients with suboptimal hydrogen sulfide levels, and as determined by your licensed medical practitioner, Xizflus may be administered as rescue or adjunctive nutritional therapy to address the risk of suboptimal hydrogen sulfide which can lead to oxidative stress, inflammatory, and/or vascular complications.<span class="Sup">1-4</span> The adjunctive use of Xizflus enables medical practitioners to combine therapeutic modalities (dietary management and drug therapy).<span class="Sup">1</span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Xizflus is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components contained in this product.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><p class="First">GENERAL<br/>
Sulfur, by itself, is not toxic to our bodies. However, some people are allergic to relatives of sulfur such as sulfites and sulfa drugs. Certain sulfites can trigger asthma and other allergic reactions in people who are sensitive. Sulfa drugs can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), skin rashes, high fever, headache, fatigue, and gastric problems for people with alpha drug allergies. Tell your health care provider if you think you may be allergic to sulfur-containing substances.</p><p>Folic acid, when administered in daily doses above 0.1mg, may obscure the detection of B12 deficiency (specifically, the administration of folic acid may reverse the hematological manifestations of B12 deficiency, including pernicious anemia, while not addressing the neurological manifestations). 5-methyltetrahydrofolate may be less likely than folic acid to mask vitamin B12 deficiency.<span class="Sup">9-10</span> Folate therapy alone is inadequate for the treatment of a B12 deficiency.</p><p>Interaction with Drugs:<br/>
Before using this product, tell your doctor or pharmacist of all the products you use. Keep a list of all your medications with you, and share the list with your doctor and pharmacist. No decrease in effectiveness of drugs has been reported with the use of Xizflus.</p><p>Hydrogen sulfide may induce cytochrome P450 2B6<span class="Sup">7</span> and 2E1<span class="Sup">8</span>, therefore it may decrease the half-life of medications metabolized by these enzymes. Careful monitoring of concomitant medications metabolized by these enzymes is recommended.</p><p>ADVERSE REACTIONS<br/>
Mild gastrointestinal (GI) issues such as flatulence and nausea were observed in sodium polysulthionate patients.<span class="Sup">1</span> All GI incidences were categorized as “mild” and no patients discontinued due to adverse events1. Allergic reactions have not been reported following the use of oral sodium polysulthionate.</p><p>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS<br/>
Pregnancy: Xizflus has not been studied in pregnant women. The choice to administer Xizflus during pregnancy is at the clinical discretion of the prescribing physician.</p><p>Labor and Delivery/NursingMothers: Xizflus has not been studied in labor and delivery. The choice to administer Xizflus during labor and delivery is at the clinical discretion of the prescribing physician.</p><p>Pediatric Use: Xizflus has not been studied in a pediatric population. The choice to administer Xizflus in pediatric populations is at the clinical discretion of the prescribing physician.</p><p>Geriatric Use: Clinical studies with Xizflus have not included sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects.</p><p>OVERDOSAGE: No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Xizflus.</p><p>Xizflus has been self-affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). The highest level of sodium polysulthionate consumption has been 1,600MG per day in clinical studies although anecdotal reports of 3,000mg per day have used without adverse events..</p><h2>DOSAGE</h2><p class="First">The adult dose of Xizflus is 1-2 servings twice a day, or 400–800mg sodium polysulthionate and 0.5-1mg 5-methyltetrahydrofolate twice per day (BID). For people who are sensitive to medications, a starting dose of 1 serving twice daily is recommended for the first week prior to titrating to a higher dose of 800mg twice daily if warranted. One to two (1-2) servings can be administered twice daily with or without food or as directed under medical supervision.</p><h2>Xizflus - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Sodium polysulthionate: consists of a biologically active sulfur based nutrients in a proprietary matrix of alpha sulfur, sodium sulfate, and sodium thiosulfate derived from food sources. In a study of health controls and heart failure patients, oral sodium polysulthionate increased hydrogens sulfide and nitric oxide levels (p&lt;0.05).<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p><br/>
Folate: folate is essential for the production of certain coenzymes in many metabolic systems such as purine and pyrimidine synthesis. Through one-carbon metabolism 5-methyltetrahydrofolate plays an essential role in homocysteine metabolism. Homocysteine metabolizes in the body to produce hydrogen sulfied, which is a strong antioxidant and vasorelaxation factor. At an elevated level, homocysteine inactivates proteins by homocysteinylation including its endogenous metabolizing enzyme, cystathionine gamma-lyase. Thus, there is a reduced production of endogenous hydrogen sulfide during hyperhomocysteinemia.<span class="Sup">12</span> 5-methyltetrahydrofolate along with methylcobolamin is an essential co-factor in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine.<span class="Sup">13</span></p><h2>INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE</h2><ul>
