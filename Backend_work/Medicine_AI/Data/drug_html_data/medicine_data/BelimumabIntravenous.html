</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of belimumab</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you belimumab in a medical facility. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins or as a shot under your skin, usually in the stomach or thighs. You or your caregiver may be trained to prepare and inject belimumab at home. Be sure that you understand how to use the medicine.</p><p>If belimumab is <i>given through a vein</i> in your arm, it must be injected by your doctor slowly and your IV tube will need to stay in place for 1 hour.</p><p>If you use belimumab at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections. Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, red, bruised, or hard.</p><p>Belimumab comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Belimumab is available in three forms: a vial (glass container), a prefilled syringe, or an autoinjector. The <i>prefilled syringe</i> and <i>autoinjector</i> are the dosage forms you can use at home.</p><p>Check the liquid in the prefilled syringe or autoinjector. It should be colorless or slightly yellow. Do not use the medicine if the liquid is cloudy, discolored, or has particles in it. Do not shake.</p><p>Allow the medicine to warm to room temperature for 30 minutes before you use it. Do not warm it in any other way.</p><p>Do not remove the needle cap from the prefilled syringe or the ring cap from the autoinjector until you are ready to use it.</p><p>You might not use all of the medicine in each prefilled syringe or autoinjector. Use each prefilled syringe and autoinjector only one time. Do not save an open syringe or autoinjector.</p><p>You may also receive other medicines to help prevent allergic reactions from the injection.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of belimumab will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of belimumab. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.

Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>You should not receive belimumab if you are also using other biologic treatments or cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®). <i>Using these medicines together may increase your chance for more serious side effects</i>.</p><p>Using belimumab while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control during treatment and for at least 4 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while using belimumab, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Belimumab may cause serious infections (eg, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, cellulitis, and bronchitis). Check with your doctor right away if you have bladder pain, bloody or cloudy urine, chest pain, cough, cough producing mucus, difficult, burning, or painful urination, fever or chills, frequent urge to urinate, itching, pain, redness, swelling, tenderness, or warmth of the skin, lower back or side pain, sneezing, sore throat, trouble breathing, or tightness in the chest.</p><p>Belimumab may increase your risk of developing infections, including a serious brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Avoid being near people who are sick and wash your hands often. Check with your doctor right away if you have a fever, chills, a cough that won't go away, flu-like symptoms, a headache, night sweats, or weight loss. Tell your doctor if you have balance problems, confusion, difficulty talking or walking, dizziness, memory loss, or vision changes.</p><p>Using belimumab may increase your risk of getting cancer. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.</p><p>Belimumab may cause infusion reactions, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you start to have a fever, chills or shaking, dizziness, trouble breathing, itching or rash, lightheadedness or fainting, after receiving belimumab.</p><p>Belimumab may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after using belimumab.</p><p>Belimumab may cause some people to be agitated, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors. It may also cause some people to have suicidal thoughts and tendencies or to become depressed. Also tell your doctor if you have sudden or strong feelings, such as feeling nervous, angry, restless, violent, or scared. If you or your caregiver notice any of these unwanted effects, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>While you are being treated with belimumab, and 30 days before starting treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Belimumab may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who are receiving live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are African-American or have African ancestry. Belimumab may not work the same way and may require caution in African-American patients receiving belimumab. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Belimumab side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
