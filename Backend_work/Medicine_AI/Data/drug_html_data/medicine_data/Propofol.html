It is used in adults as well as children 2 months and older.</p><p>Propofol is also used to sedate a patient who is under critical care and needs a mechanical ventilator (breathing machine).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before you receive propofol, tell your doctor about all your medical conditions and allergies.

These effects may be more likely when the anesthesia is used for 3 hours or longer, or used for repeated procedures. Effects on brain development could cause learning or behavior problems later in life.</p><p>Negative brain effects from anesthesia have been seen in animal studies. However, studies in human children receiving single short uses of anesthesia have not shown a likely effect on behavior or learning. More research is needed.</p><p>In some cases, your doctor may decide to postpone a surgery or procedure based on these risks. Treatment may not be delayed in the case of life-threatening conditions, medical emergencies, or surgery needed to correct certain birth defects.</p><p>Ask your doctor for information about all medicines that will be used during your surgery or procedure. Also ask how long the procedure will last.</p><p>Propofol can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. However, as propofol acts and leaves the body quickly, most women can resume breastfeeding as soon as they are recovered from anesthesia and fully awake.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is propofol given?</h2><p>Propofol is injected into a vein through an IV.
