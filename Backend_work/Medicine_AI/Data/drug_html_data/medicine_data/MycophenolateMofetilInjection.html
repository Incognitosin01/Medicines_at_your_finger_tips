</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Mycophenolate Mofetil Injection</h2><p class="First">Mycophenolate Mofetil for Injection is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection, in recipients of allogeneic kidney <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)],</span> heart <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span> or liver transplants <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>, in combination with other immunosuppressants.</p><h2>Mycophenolate Mofetil Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mycophenolate mofetil for injection should not be used without the supervision of a physician with experience in immunosuppressive therapy.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mycophenolate Mofetil for Injection</span></p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil for injection is recommended for patients unable to take oral mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate mofetil for injection should be administered within 24 hours following transplant. Mycophenolate mofetil for injection can be administered for up to 14 days; however, patients should be switched to oral mycophenolate mofetil as soon as they can tolerate oral medication.</p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil for injection must be reconstituted before use <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>. Mycophenolate mofetil for injection is incompatible with other intravenous infusion solutions and should not be mixed or administered concurrently via the same infusion catheter with other intravenous drugs or infusion admixtures.</p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil for injection must not be administered as a bolus. Following reconstitution, mycophenolate mofetil for injection must be administered by slow intravenous infusion over a period of no less than 2 hours by either peripheral or central vein, as rapid infusion increases the risk of local adverse reactions such as phlebitis and thrombosis <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosing for Kidney Transplant Patients: Adults and Pediatrics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The recommended dose for adult kidney transplant patients is 1 g orally or intravenously infused over no less than 2 hours, twice daily (daily dose of 2 g).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatrics (3 months and older)</span></p><p>Pediatric dosing is based on body surface area (BSA). The recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil oral suspension for pediatric kidney transplant patients 3 months and older is 600 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, administered twice daily (maximum daily dose of 2g or 10 mL of the oral suspension). Pediatric patients with BSA ≥ 1.25 m<span class="Sup">2</span> may be dosed with capsules or tablets as follows:</p><h3>Dosing for Heart Transplant Patients: Adults</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil for adult heart transplant patients is 1.5 g orally or intravenously infused over no less than 2 hours administered twice daily (daily dose of 3 g).</p><h3>Dosing for Liver Transplant Patients: Adults</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil for adult liver transplant patients is 1.5 g administered orally twice daily (daily dose of 3 g) or 1 g infused intravenously over no less than 2 hours, twice daily (daily dose of 2 g).</p><h3>Dosing Adjustments: Patients with Renal Impairment, Neutropenia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>No dose adjustments are needed in kidney transplant patients with delayed graft function postoperatively <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. In <span class="Bold">kidney transplant patients with severe chronic impairment of the graft</span> (GFR &lt;25 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>), do not administer doses of Mycophenolate mofetil for injection greater than 1 g twice a day. These patients should be carefully monitored <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Neutropenia</span></p><p>If neutropenia develops (ANC &lt;1.3 x 10<span class="Sup">3</span>/μL), dosing with mycophenolate mofetil for injection should be interrupted or reduced, appropriate diagnostic tests performed, and the patient managed appropriately <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1].</span></p><h3>Preparation Instructions of Intravenous for Pharmacists</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General Preparation Instructions Before Handling the Formulations</span></p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has demonstrated teratogenic effects in humans. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures<span class="Sup">1</span> <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)]</span>.</p><p>Care should be taken to avoid inhalation or direct contact with skin or mucous membranes of the dry powder or the constituted suspension because MMF has demonstrated teratogenic effects in humans. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended during reconstitution and when wiping the outer surface of the bottle/cap and the table surface after reconstitution. If such contact occurs, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water; rinse eyes with water.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mycophenolate Mofetil for Injection</span></p><p>Before proceeding with the preparation steps for mycophenolate mofetil for injection read the general preparation instructions <span class="Italics">[see General Preparation Instructions Before Handling the Formulations]</span> and note the following:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Mycophenolate mofetil for injection does not contain an antibacterial preservative; therefore, reconstitution and dilution of the product must be performed under aseptic conditions.</li>
<li>This product is sealed under vacuum and should retain a vacuum throughout its shelf life. If a lack of vacuum in the vial is noted while adding the diluent, the vial should not be used.</li>
</ul><p>Mycophenolate mofetil for injection must be reconstituted and further diluted. A detailed description of the preparation is given below.</p><p>The administration of the infusion should be initiated within 4 hours of reconstitution and dilution of the drug product. Keep solutions at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15° and 30°C (59° and 86°F). Discard unused portion of the reconstituted solutions.</p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil for injection should not be mixed or administered concurrently via the same infusion catheter with other intravenous drugs or infusion admixtures.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Mycophenolate Mofetil for Injection, USP is available in the following dosage form and strength:</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Allergic reactions to mycophenolate mofetil have been observed; therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mycophenolic acid (MPA) or any component of the drug product. Mycophenolate mofetil is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to Polysorbate 80 (TWEEN).</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Embryofetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Use of MMF during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney and nervous system. Females of reproductive potential must be made aware of these risks and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. Avoid use of MMF during pregnancy if safer treatment options are available <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].</span></p><h3>Lymphoma and Other Malignancies</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. For patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.</p><p>Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of kidney, heart and liver transplant patients <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> The majority of PTLD cases appear to be related to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides PTLD were observed in clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Serious Infections</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, fungal, protozoal and new or reactivated viral infections, including opportunistic infections. The risk increases with the total immunosuppressive load. These infections may lead to serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and death <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), (6.2)].</span></p><p>Serious viral infections reported include:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection</li>
<li>JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and</li>
<li>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections: CMV seronegative transplant patients who receive an organ from a CMV seropositive donor are at highest risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease.</li>
<li>Viral reactivation in patients infected with Hepatitis B and C</li>
</ul><p>Consider reducing immunosuppression in patients who develop new infections or reactivate viral infections, weighing the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft.</p><p>PVAN, especially due to BK virus infection, is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span> Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN.</p><p>PML, which is sometimes fatal, commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies, and ataxia <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms.</p><p>The risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease is highest among transplant recipients seronegative for CMV at time of transplant who receive a graft from a CMV seropositive donor. Therapeutic approaches to limiting CMV disease exist and should be routinely provided. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for CMV disease.</p><p>Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Monitoring infected patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV or HCV infection is recommended.</p><h3>Blood Dyscrasias: Neutropenia and Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA)</h3><p class="First">Severe neutropenia [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;0.5 x 10<span class="Sup">3</span>/μL] developed in transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil should be monitored for neutropenia. Neutropenia has been observed most frequently in the period from 31 to 180 days post-transplant in patients treated for prevention of kidney, heart and liver rejection. The development of neutropenia may be related to mycophenolate mofetil itself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or a combination of these causes. If neutropenia develops (ANC &lt;1.3 x 10<span class="Sup">3</span>/μL), dosing with mycophenolate mofetil should be interrupted or the dose reduced, appropriate diagnostic tests performed, and the patient managed appropriately <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].</span></p><p>Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, unexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow depression.</p><p>Consider monitoring with complete blood counts weekly for the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months, and monthly for the remainder of the first year.</p><p>Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. In some cases, PRCA was found to be reversible with dose reduction or cessation of mycophenolate mofetil therapy. In transplant patients, however, reduced immunosuppression may place the graft at risk.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Complications</h3><p class="First">Gastrointestinal bleeding requiring hospitalization, ulceration and perforations were observed in clinical trials. Physicians should be aware of these serious adverse effects particularly when administering mycophenolate mofetil to patients with a gastrointestinal disease.</p><h3>Patients with Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyl-Transferase Deficiency (HGPRT)</h3><p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor; therefore it should be avoided in patients with hereditary deficiencies of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndromes because it may cause an exacerbation of disease symptoms characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of uric acid leading to symptoms associated with gout such as acute arthritis, tophi, nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis and renal disease including renal failure.</p><h3>Immunizations</h3><p class="First">During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (e.g., intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines) and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective. Advise patients to discuss with the physician before seeking any immunizations.</p><h3>Local Reactions with Rapid Intravenous Administration</h3><p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil solution must not be administered by rapid or bolus intravenous injection as rapid infusion increases the risk of local adverse reactions such as phlebitis and thrombosis <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Blood Donation</h3><p class="First">Patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil because their blood or blood products might be administered to a female of reproductive potential or a pregnant woman.</p><h3>Semen Donation</h3><p class="First">Based on animal data, men should not donate semen during therapy and for 90 days following discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil <span class="Italics">[see Use In Specific Populations (8.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Effect of Concomitant Medications on Mycophenolic Acid Concentrations</h3><p class="First">A variety of drugs have potential to alter systemic MPA exposure when co-administered with mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, determination of MPA concentrations in plasma before and after making any changes to immunosuppressive therapy, or when adding or discontinuing concomitant medications, may be appropriate to ensure MPA concentrations remain stable.</p><h3>Potential Impairment of Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery</h3><p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil may impact the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should avoid driving or using machines if they experience somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor, or hypotension during treatment with mycophenolate mofetil <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>An estimated total of 1557 patients received mycophenolate mofetil during pivotal clinical trials in the prevention of acute organ rejection. Of these, 991 were included in the three renal studies, 277 were included in one hepatic study, and 289 were included in one cardiac study. Patients in all study arms also received cyclosporine and corticosteroids.</p><p>The data described below primarily derive from five randomized, active-controlled double-blind 12-month trials of mycophenolate mofetil in <span class="Italics">de novo</span> kidney (3) heart (1) and liver (1) transplant patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2 and 14.3)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral</span></p><p>The incidence of adverse reactions for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in five randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in the prevention of rejection in kidney, heart and liver transplant patients (two active- and one placebo-controlled trials, one active-controlled trial, and one active-controlled trial, respectively) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2 and 14.3)]</span>.</p><p>The three <span class="Italics">de novo</span> kidney studies with 12-month duration compared two dose levels of oral mycophenolate mofetil (1 g twice daily and 1.5 g twice daily) with azathioprine (2 studies) or placebo (1 study) when administered in combination with cyclosporine (Sandimmune<span class="Sup">®</span>) and corticosteroids to prevent acute rejection episodes. One study also included anti-thymocyte globulin (ATGAM<span class="Sup">®</span>) induction therapy.</p><p>In the <span class="Italics">de novo</span> heart transplantation study with 12-month duration, patients received mycophenolate mofetil 1.5 g twice daily (n=289) or azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day (n=289), in combination with cyclosporine (Sandimmune<span class="Sup">®</span> or Neoral<span class="Sup">®</span>) and corticosteroids as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p>In the <span class="Italics">de novo</span> liver transplantation study with 12-month duration, patients received mycophenolate mofetil 1 g twice daily intravenously for up to 14 days followed by mycophenolate mofetil 1.5 g twice daily orally or azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day intravenously followed by azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day orally, in combination with cyclosporine (Neoral<span class="Sup">®</span>) and corticosteroids as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. The total number of patients enrolled was 565.</p><p>Approximately 53% of the kidney transplant patients, 65% of the heart transplant patients, and 48% of the liver transplant patients were treated for more than 1 year. Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

Three-year safety data in kidney and heart transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, PTLD was observed in 1.35% (2/148) by 12 months post-transplant.</p><p>Cytopenias, including leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, are a known risk associated with mycophenolate and may lead or contribute to the occurrence of infections and hemorrhages <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>. Severe neutropenia (ANC &lt;0.5 x 10<span class="Sup">3</span>/μL) developed in up to 2% of kidney transplant patients, up to 2.8% of heart transplant patients and up to 3.6% of liver transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Dosage and Administration (2.5)].</span></p><p>The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil with other immunosuppressants were mucocutaneous candida, CMV viremia/syndrome, and herpes simplex. The proportion of patients with CMV viremia/syndrome was 13.5%. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of kidney, heart or liver rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of kidney and heart patients and in 5% of liver patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><p>The most serious gastrointestinal disorders reported were ulceration and hemorrhage, which are known risks associated with mycophenolate mofetil. Mouth, esophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal ulcers often complicated by hemorrhage, as well as hematemesis, melena, and hemorrhagic forms of gastritis and colitis were commonly reported during the pivotal clinical trials, while the most common gastrointestinal disorders were diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic investigation of patients with mycophenolate mofetil-related diarrhea revealed isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><p>The following adverse reactions were reported with 3% to &lt;20% incidence in kidney, heart, and liver transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Study</span></p><p>The type and frequency of adverse events in a clinical study for prevention of kidney allograft rejection in 100 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age dosed with mycophenolate mofetil oral suspension 600 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily (up to 1 g twice daily) were generally similar to those observed in adult patients dosed with mycophenolate mofetil capsules at a dose of 1 g twice daily with the exception of abdominal pain, fever, infection, pain, sepsis, diarrhea, vomiting, pharyngitis, respiratory tract infection, hypertension, leukopenia, and anemia, which were observed in a higher proportion in pediatric patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Geriatrics</span></p><p>Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mycophenolate Mofetil for Injection</span></p><p>The safety profile of mycophenolate mofetil for injection was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in kidney transplant patients in the immediate post-transplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil for injection was evaluated by comparing the adverse reactions attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil for injection with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in the placebo group received active medication by the oral route.</p><p>Adverse reactions attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil for injection.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mycophenolate mofetil.

MPA is a selective, uncompetitive, and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and therefore inhibits the <span class="Italics">de novo</span> pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA. Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on <span class="Italics">de novo</span> synthesis of purines, whereas other cell types can utilize salvage pathways, MPA has potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes. MPA inhibits proliferative responses of T- and B-lymphocytes to both mitogenic and allospecific stimulation. Addition of guanosine or deoxyguanosine reverses the cytostatic effects of MPA on lymphocytes. MPA also suppresses antibody formation by B-lymphocytes. MPA prevents the glycosylation of lymphocyte and monocyte glycoproteins that are involved in intercellular adhesion to endothelial cells and may inhibit recruitment of leukocytes into sites of inflammation and graft rejection. MMF did not inhibit early events in the activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, such as the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), but did block the coupling of these events to DNA synthesis and proliferation.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">There is a lack of information regarding the pharmacodynamic effects of MMF.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following oral and intravenous administration, MMF undergoes complete conversion to MPA, the active metabolite.

The area under the plasma-concentration time curve (AUC) for MPA appears to increase in a dose-proportional fashion in kidney transplant patients receiving multiple oral doses of MMF up to a daily dose of 3 g (1.5g twice daily) (see <span class="Bold">Table 8</span>).</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span>AUC(0-12h) values quoted are extrapolated from data from samples collected over 4 hours.</p><p>In the early post-transplant period (less than 40 days post-transplant), kidney, heart, and liver transplant patients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 20% to 41% lower and mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> approximately 32% to 44% lower compared to the late transplant period (i.e., 3 to 6 months post-transplant) (non-stationarity in MPA pharmacokinetics).</p><p>Mean MPA AUC values following administration of 1 g twice daily intravenous mycophenolate mofetil over 2 hours to kidney transplant patients for 5 days were about 24% higher than those observed after oral administration of a similar dose in the immediate post-transplant phase.</p><p>In liver transplant patients, administration of 1 g twice daily intravenous mycophenolate mofetil followed by 1.5 g twice daily oral mycophenolate mofetil resulted in mean MPA AUC estimates similar to those found in kidney transplant patients administered 1 g mycophenolate mofetil twice daily.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Effect of Food</span></p><p>Food (27 g fat, 650 calories) had no effect on the extent of absorption (MPA AUC) of MMF when administered at doses of 1.5 g twice daily to kidney transplant patients.

At clinically relevant concentrations, MPA is 97% bound to plasma albumin. The phenolic glucuronide metabolite of MPA (MPAG) is 82% bound to plasma albumin at MPAG concentration ranges that are normally seen in stable kidney transplant patients; however, at higher MPAG concentrations (observed in patients with kidney impairment or delayed kidney graft function), the binding of MPA may be reduced as a result of competition between MPAG and MPA for protein binding. Mean blood to plasma ratio of radioactivity concentrations was approximately 0.6 indicating that MPA and MPAG do not extensively distribute into the cellular fractions of blood.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies to evaluate the effect of other agents on the binding of MPA to human serum albumin (HSA) or plasma proteins showed that salicylate (at 25 mg/dL with human serum albumin) and MPAG (at ≥ 460 mcg/mL with plasma proteins) increased the free fraction of MPA. MPA at concentrations as high as 100 mcg/mL had little effect on the binding of warfarin, digoxin or propranolol, but decreased the binding of theophylline from 53% to 45% and phenytoin from 90% to 87%.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Mean (±SD) apparent half-life and plasma clearance of MPA are 17.9 (±6.5) hours and 193 (±48) mL/min following oral administration and 16.6 (±5.8) hours and 177 (±31) mL/min following intravenous administration, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>The parent drug, MMF, can be measured systemically during the intravenous infusion; however, approximately 5 minutes after the infusion is stopped or after oral administration, MMF concentrations are below the limit of quantitation (0.4 mcg/mL).</p><p>Metabolism to MPA occurs pre-systemically after oral dosing. MPA is metabolized principally by glucuronyl transferase to form MPAG, which is not pharmacologically active. <span class="Italics">In vivo</span>, MPAG is converted to MPA during enterohepatic recirculation. The following metabolites of the 2-hydroxyethyl-morpholino moiety are also recovered in the urine following oral administration of MMF to healthy subjects: N-(2-carboxymethyl)-morpholine, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine, and the N-oxide of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine.</p><p>Due to the enterohepatic recirculation of MPAG/MPA, secondary peaks in the plasma MPA concentration-time profile are usually observed 6 to 12 hours post-dose. Bile sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, reduce MPA AUC by interfering with this enterohepatic recirculation of the drug <span class="Italics">[see Overdose (10</span>) <span class="Italics">and Drug Interaction Studies below]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Negligible amount of drug is excreted as MPA (less than 1% of dose) in the urine.

In kidney transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC(0-12h)) was approximately 30-50% greater when MMF was administered without cyclosporine compared with when MMF was coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA.

The highest dose tested was 0.4 times the recommended clinical dose (2 g/day) in renal transplant patients and 0.3 times the recommended clinical dose (3 g/day) in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for differences in body surface area (BSA). In a 104-week oral carcinogenicity study in rats, MMF in daily doses up to 15 mg/kg was not tumorigenic. The highest dose was 0.07 times the recommended clinical dose in kidney transplant patients and 0.05 times the recommended clinical dose in heart transplant patients when corrected for BSA. While these animal doses were lower than those given to patients, they were maximal in those species and were considered adequate to evaluate the potential for human risk <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><p>The genotoxic potential of MMF was determined in five assays. MMF was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma/thymidine kinase assay and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay. MMF was not genotoxic in the bacterial mutation assay, the yeast mitotic gene conversion assay or the Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay.</p><p>MMF had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. This dose represents 0.1 times the recommended clinical dose in renal transplant patients and 0.06 times the recommended clinical dose in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for BSA. In a female fertility and reproduction study conducted in rats, oral doses of 4.5 mg/kg/day caused malformations (principally of the head and eyes) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. This dose was 0.02 times the recommended clinical dose in renal transplant patients and 0.01 times the recommended clinical dose in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for BSA. No effects on fertility or reproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Kidney Transplantation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The three <span class="Italics">de novo</span> kidney transplantation studies compared two dose levels of oral mycophenolate mofetil (1 g twice daily and 1.5 g twice daily) with azathioprine (2 studies) or placebo (1 study) to prevent acute rejection episodes.

<ul class="Circle">
<li><span class="Bold">white blood cells, especially neutrophils.</span> Neutrophils fight against bacterial infections. You have a higher chance of getting an infection when your white blood cell count is low. This is most common from 1 month to 6 months after your transplant.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">red blood cells.</span> Red blood cells carry oxygen to your body tissues. You have a higher chance of getting severe anemia when your red blood cell count is low.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">platelets</span>. Platelets help with blood clotting.
<p class="First">Your doctor will do blood tests before you start taking mycophenolate mofetil and during treatment with mycophenolate mofetil to check your blood cell counts. Tell your doctor right away if you have any signs of infection (See <span class="Bold">“What is the most important information I should know about mycophenolate mofetil?”</span>), including any unexpected bruising or bleeding. Also, tell your doctor if you have unusual tiredness, lack of energy, dizziness or fainting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Stomach problems.</span> Stomach problems including intestinal bleeding, a tear in your intestinal wall (perforation) or stomach ulcers can happen in people who take mycophenolate mofetil. Bleeding can be severe and you may have to be hospitalized for treatment. Call your doctor right away if you have sudden or severe stomach-area pain or stomach-area pain that does not go away, or if you have diarrhea.</li>
