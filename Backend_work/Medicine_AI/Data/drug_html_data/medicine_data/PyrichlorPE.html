In therapeutic doses, the drug has no significant stimulant effect on the beta (β) adrenergic receptors of the heart. Following oral administration, constriction of the blood vessels in the nasal mucosa may relieve nasal congestion. In therapeutic doses the drug causes little, if any, central nervous stimulation.</p><h3>Pyrilamine Maleate</h3><p class="First">Pyrilamine is an antihistamine belonging to the ethylenediamine class. Pyrilamine is a highly effective H<span class="Sub">1</span> blocker, which possesses local anesthetic activity. Pyrilamine antagonizes most of the smooth muscle stimulating actions of histamine on the H<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors of the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels and bronchial muscle. It also antagonizes the actions of histamines that result in increased capillary permeability and the formation of edema. Pyrilamine has a duration of action of 4 to 6 hours.</p><h3>Chlorpheniramine Maleate</h3><p class="First">Chlorpheniramine Maleate is an antihistamine belonging to the alkylamine class. It possesses anticholinergic and sedative effects. It is considered one of the most effective and least toxic of the histamine antagonists. Chlorpheniramine is an H<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor antagonist. It antagonizes many of the pharmacological actions of histamine. Chlorpheniramine has a duration of action of 4 to 6 hours.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Pyrichlor PE</h2><p class="First">For the temporary relief of nasal congestion due to the common cold, hay fever or other respiratory allergies.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to antihistamines, or sympathomimetic amines, and in patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy (or for 14 days after stopping MAOI therapy), (see <span class="Bold">DRUG INTERACTIONS</span>). Sympathomimetic amines are contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension or severe coronary artery disease.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Do not exceed recommended dosage.</span> If nervousness, dizziness, or sleeplessness occurs, discontinue use and consult a doctor. If symptoms do not improve within 7 days or are accompanied by a fever, consult a doctor. Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, bladder neck obstruction. Sympathomimetic amines should be used with caution in patients with hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, or prostatic hypertrophy. Sympathomimetics may produce central nervous system stimulation with convulsions or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension.</p><p>May cause drowsiness; alcohol, sedatives, and tranquilizers may increase the drowsiness effect. Avoid alcoholic beverages while taking this product. Do not take this product if you are taking sedatives or tranquilizers, without first consulting your doctor. Use caution when driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery.</p><p>Sedatives and tranquilizers may increase the drowsiness effect. Do not give this product to children who are taking sedatives or tranquilizers, without first consulting the child's doctor.</p><p><span class="Bold">May cause excitability especially in children.</span></p><p>Do not take this product, unless directed by a doctor, if you have a breathing problem such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, or if you have glaucoma or difficulty in urination due to enlargement of the prostate gland.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Antihistamines have an atropine-like action and therefore should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, hyperactivity to ephedrine.</p><p>Stimulants, such as phenylephrine, are banned and tested for by the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).</p><p><span class="Bold">If pregnant, or planning to become pregnant or are currently breast-feeding please contact your physician, or health-care provider before using or continuing use.</span></p><h3>Information To Patients</h3><p class="First">Antihistamines may impair mental and physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Patients should be warned accordingly.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is unknown whether this product can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or affect reproduction. This product should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Some sympathomimetics are excreted in breast milk. Use of this product by nursing mothers is not recommended because of the higher than usual risk for infants from sympathomimetic amines.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">This product is not indicated for use in children under 6 years old. Antihistamines may diminish mental alertness; in young children, they may produce paradoxical excitation.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The elderly (60 years and older) are more likely to experience adverse reactions to sympathomimetics.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No data are available on the long-term potential of the components of this product for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility in animals or humans.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Hyperactive individuals may display ephedrine-like reactions such as tachycardia, palpitations, headache, dizziness, or nausea. Sympathomimetics have been associated with certain untoward reactions including fear, anxiety, nervousness, restlessness, tremor, weakness, pallor, respiratory difficulty, dysuria, insomnia, hallucinations, convulsions, CNS depression, arrhythmias, and cardiovascular collapse with hypotension. Possible side effects of antihistamines are drowsiness, dry mouth, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache and nervousness, blurred vision, polyuria, heartburn, dysuria, and very rarely, dermatitis.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">MAO inhibitors (or for 14 days after stopping MAOI therapy), and tricyclic antidepressants may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Beta-adrenergic blockers and MAO inhibitors (or for 14 days after stopping MAOI therapy), may potentiate the pressor effect of sympathomimetics. Concurrent use of digitalis glycosides may increase the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias. Sympathomimetics may reduce the hypotensive effects of guanethidine, mecamylamine, methyldopa, reserpine and veratrum alkaloids. Concurrent use of tricyclic antidepressants may antagonize the effects of sympathomimetics. Concomitant use of antihistamines with alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates and other CNS depressants may have an additive effect.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Manifestations of antihistamine overdosage may vary from CNS depression (sedation, apnea, cardiovascular collapse) to stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremors, or convulsions). Other signs and symptoms may be dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision and hypertension. Stimulation is particularly likely in children, as are atropine-like signs and symptoms. Overdosage with sympathomimetics may manifest itself as excessive CNS stimulation resulting in excitement, tremor, restlessness and insomnia. Other effects may include tachycardia, hypertension, pallor, mydriasis, hypernea, hallucinations, but in some individuals there may be CNS depression with somnolence, stupor or respiratory depression. Arrhythmias (including ventricular fibrillation) may lead to a compartmental shift rather than a depletion of potassium.</p><h3>Treatment</h3><p class="First">In the event of overdosage, emergency treatment should be started immediately. Since the action of a sustained release product may continue for as long as 12 hours, treatment of overdosage should be directed toward reducing further absorption and supporting the patient for at least that length of time. Gastric emptying (syrup of Ipecac) and/or lavage is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion, even if patient has vomited spontaneously. Either isotonic or half-isotonic saline may be used for lavage. Administration of an activated charcoal slurry is beneficial after lavage and or emesis if less than 4 hours have passed since ingestion. Saline cathartics, such as Milk of Magnesia, are useful for hastening the evacuation of unreleased medication. In severe cases of overdose, it is essential to monitor both the heart (by electrocardiograph) and plasma electrolytes, and to give intravenous potassium as indicated. Vasopressors may be used to treat hypotension. Excessive CNS stimulation may be counteracted with parenteral diazepam. Stimulants should not be used. Hyperpyrexia, especially in children, may require treatment with tepid water sponge baths or hypothermic blanket. Apnea is treated with ventilatory support.</p><h2>Pyrichlor PE Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults:</span> 1-2 Teaspoonfuls every 4-6 hours, or as directed by your physician or health-care provider. <span class="Bold">Do not exceed 8 teaspoonfuls in a 24 hour period.
