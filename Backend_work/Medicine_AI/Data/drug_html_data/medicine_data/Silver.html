Once ionized, silver is bactericidal; it binds to bacterial cell membranes, disrupts the bacterial cell wall, and causes cell leakage (International Consensus, 2012).</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Little systemic absorption (International Consensus, 2012)</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Feces (primarily) and urine (International Consensus, 2012)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Wound management:</b> Topical anti-infective used in the management of first- or second-degree burns and wounds (including abrasions; device insertion wounds; lacerations, skin tears, and/or superficial wounds; donor, graft, and/or surgical incision sites; diabetic, pressure, and/or stasis ulcers).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to silver or any component of the formulation.</p><p>3M Tegaderm Ag Mesh: Hypersensitivity to cotton; application to third-degree burns; use as a surgical sponge; use with enzymatic debriding agents that are contraindicated with silver products</p><p>Acticoat, Acticoat Flex 3 and 7, Acticoat Surgical: Use during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or radiation therapy</p><p>Acticoat Moisture Control: Use during MRI</p><p>Acticoat Site: Hypersensitivity to polyurethane; use during MRI</p><p>Restore: Hypersensitivity to alginates; application to third-degree burns; surgical implantation; to control heavy bleeding; use on dry or lightly exuding wounds</p><p>Silverseal Hydrogel: Hypersensitivity to nylon; use with cardiac defibrillators</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Wound Management: Note:</b> General dosing considerations presented; consult full manufacturers labeling prior to use. Assess need for continued treatment after 2 weeks of therapy. Once the infection is under control and the wound is healing, consider a change to a nonantimicrobial dressing (International Consensus 2012).</p><p>Dressing: Topical:</p><p>3M Tegaderm Ag Mesh: Apply directly to wound; change as needed. Dressing remains effective for up to 7 days.</p><p>Acticoat, Acticoat 7: Apply directly to wound; Acticoat 7 may be left in place for up to 7 days.</p><p>Acticoat Flex: Apply directly to wound. Acticoat Flex 3 may be left in place for up to 3 days; Acticoat Flex 7 may be left in place for up to 7 days.</p><p>Acticoat Moisture Control, Acticoat Site, Acticoat Surgical: Apply directly to wound.

Refer to manufacturer labeling for recommendations on need for moistening dressing prior to application and selection of appropriate secondary dressings. Prior to removal, dressings that have adhered to the wound surface may first be saturated with sterile normal saline or sterile water; gently remove once dressing has softened.</p><p>Acticoat (all products): Prior to application, do not use with saline.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at room temperature.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>There are no known significant interactions.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Frequency not defined.</p><p>Dermatologic: Allergic skin reaction, erythema, skin cyanosis, local discoloration (temporary black discoloration at application site)</p><p>Local: Application site irritation</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Enzymatic debriding agents: Silver dressings should not be used on wounds undergoing enzymatic debridement (International Consensus 2012).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Pediatric: Use with caution (International Consensus 2012).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• 3M Tegaderm Ag Mesh: Remove prior to MRI. Effectiveness may be decreased with concomitant use of iodophor-containing products.</p><p>• Acticoat, Acticoat Flex 3 and 7: Remove prior to MRI or radiation therapy. Do not use with saline. Dressing is not compatible with oil-based products (eg, petrolatum). Do not use Acticoat if color is not uniform; Acticoat Flex 3 and 7 dressing color may vary and does not affect performance. Avoid contact with electrodes or conductive gels during electronic measurements such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG).</p><p>• Acticoat 7: Do not use with saline. Dressing is not compatible with oil-based products (eg, petrolatum). Do not use if product color is not uniform. Avoid contact with electrodes or conductive gels during electronic measurements such as EEG and ECG.</p><p>• Acticoat Moisture Control, Acticoat Site, Acticoat Surgical: Remove prior to MRI. Do not use with saline. Dressing is not compatible with oil-based products (eg petrolatum), topical antimicrobials, or oxidizing agents. Avoid contact with electrodes or conductive gels during electronic measurements such as EEG and ECG. Acticoat Site and Acticoat Surgical should be removed prior to radiation therapy. Acticoat Site should be removed prior to x-ray (may obscure imaging).</p><p>• Restore: Dressing performance may be impaired with excessive use of petrolatum ointments.</p><p>• Silverseal: Remove prior to cardiac defibrillation, MRI, or radiation therapy. Dressing is not compatible with oil-based products (eg, petrolatum).</p><p>• Solox: Do not use on wounds with high amounts of exudate.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For external use only. Silver dressings are used to reduce bacteria in acute or chronic wounds and to act as an antimicrobial barrier for acute or chronic wounds that have a high risk of infection or reinfection. The manufacturer's labeling should be consulted prior to use. Silver dressings should not be used on clean wounds or small acute wounds at low risk of infection, or chronic wounds that are healing. Use caution on very large wounds. Silver dressings are intended to be used on wounds requiring silver delivery over several days, reducing the need for frequent dressing changes (International Consensus 2012).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Although systemic absorption following topical application is considered to be low, use in pregnancy is not currently recommended (International Consensus, 2012)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat minor cuts, scrapes, or burns.</p><p>• It is used to treat skin irritation.</p><p>• It is used to promote healing of skin ulcers and wounds.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
