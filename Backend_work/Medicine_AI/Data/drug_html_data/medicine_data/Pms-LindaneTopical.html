Seizures and deaths have been reported following lindane shampoo use with repeat or prolonged application, but also in rare cases following a single application according to directions. Lindane shampoo should be used with caution in infants, children, the elderly, and individuals with other skin conditions, and those who weigh less than 110 pounds (50 kg) as they may be at risk of serious neurotoxicity. Lindane shampoo is contraindicated in premature infants and individuals with known uncontrolled seizure disorders. Instruct patients on the proper use of lindane shampoo, the amount to apply, how long to leave it on, and avoiding retreatment. Inform patients that itching occurs after the successful killing of lice and is not necessarily an indication for retreatment with lindane shampoo .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>
