HIV is the virus that can cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</p><p>Rilpivirine is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat HIV. Rilpivirine is for use in adults and children at least 12 years old who weigh at least 77 pounds (35 kilograms) and have never before taken an HIV medicine. Rilpivirine is not a cure for HIV or AIDS.</p><p>Rilpivirine is sometimes used with a medicine called cabotegravir as a daily "lead-in dose" to help determine that you can safely use a combination form of these medicines given as a monthly injection. Rilpivirine and cabotegravir may also be given short-term in place of the monthly injectable combination for up to 2 months. When used with cabotegravir for these purposes, rilpivirine is only for adults with HIV who have already used other antiviral medicines that have controlled their viral load.</p><p>Rilpivirine may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Tell your doctor about all your current medicines and any you start or stop using.

HIV can be passed to your baby if the virus is not controlled during pregnancy. Your name may be listed on a registry to track any effects of antiviral medicine on the baby.</p><p>Women with HIV or AIDS should not breastfeed a baby. Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk.</p><p>Rilpivirine is not approved for use by anyone younger than 12 years old or weighing less than 77 pounds (35 kilograms).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take rilpivirine?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Rilpivirine is usually taken once per day with a full meal (not just a protein drink). <b>Always take the medicine with food.</b></p><p>When given together, rilpivirine and cabotegravir are usually taken once per day starting at least 28 days before you switch to the monthly injectable combination. On the last day you take rilpivirine and cabotegravir, you will receive your first monthly injectable dose of these medicines.</p><p>If you take rilpivirine with cabotegravir to replace a missed dose of the injectable combination, take rilpivirine and cabotegravir tablets each day until your next monthly injection is due.</p><p>If you plan to miss a monthly injection by more than 7 days, start taking rilpivirine and cabotegravir tablets about 1 month after your last injection was given. Keep taking the tablets each day until your next monthly injection is due.</p><p>If needed, daily rilpivirine and cabotegravir tablets can replace the injectable combination for up to 2 months in a row.</p><p>You may need frequent medical tests while taking rilpivirine, and for several months after you stop.</p><p>Use all HIV medications as directed and read all medication guides you receive. Do not change your dose or stop using a medicine without your doctor's advice. Every person with HIV should remain under the care of a doctor.</p><p>Store rilpivirine in its original container at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine with food as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if you are more than 12 hours late for the dose. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><p>Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking rilpivirine?</h2><p>Using  rilpivirine will not prevent your disease from spreading.
