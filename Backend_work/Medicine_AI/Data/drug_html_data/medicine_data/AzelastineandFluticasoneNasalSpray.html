</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Azelastine and Fluticasone Nasal Spray</h2><h3>Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis</h3><p class="First">Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is indicated for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 6 years of age and older who require treatment with both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate for symptomatic relief.</p><h2>Azelastine and Fluticasone Nasal Spray Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosing Information</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is 1 spray in each nostril twice daily.</p><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Administer Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray by the intranasal route only.</p><p>Shake the bottle gently before each use.</p><p><span class="Bold">Priming:</span> Prime Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray before initial use by releasing 6 sprays or until a fine mist appears. When Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray has not been used for 14 or more days, reprime with 1 spray or until a fine mist appears.</p><p>Avoid spraying Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray into the eyes. If sprayed in the eyes, flush eyes with water for at least 10 minutes.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is a nasal spray suspension.<br/>
Each spray delivers a volume of 0.137 mL suspension containing 137 mcg of azelastine hydrochloride and 50 mcg of fluticasone propionate (137 mcg/50 mcg).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Somnolence</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients (6 of 853 adult and adolescent patients and 2 of 416 children) taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in placebo controlled trials [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>]. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after administration of Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray. Concurrent use of Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.1)</span>].</p><h3>Local Nasal Effects</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials of 2 to 52 weeks’ duration, epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray than those who received placebo [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6)</span>].</p><p>Instances of nasal ulceration and nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the intranasal application of corticosteroids. There were no instances of nasal ulceration or nasal septal perforation observed in clinical trials with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray.</p><p>Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should avoid use of Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray until healing has occurred.</p><p>In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate administered intranasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with <span class="Italics">Candida albicans</span> has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of treatment with Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray. Patients using Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of <span class="Italics">Candida</span> infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa.</p><h3>Glaucoma and Cataracts</h3><p class="First">Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.</p><p>Glaucoma and cataract formation were evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in a controlled 12-month study in 612 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older with perennial allergic or vasomotor rhinitis (VMR). Of the 612 patients enrolled in the study, 405 were randomized to receive azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray (1 spray per nostril twice daily) and 207 were randomized to receive fluticasone propionate nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril once daily). In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray group, one patient had increased intraocular pressure at month 6. In addition, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 6 and one at month 12 (end of treatment). In the fluticasone propionate group, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 12 (end of treatment).</p><h3>Immunosuppression</h3><p class="First">Persons who are using drugs, such as corticosteroids, that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</p><p>Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections.</p><h3>Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Effects</h3><p class="First">When intranasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The concomitant use of intranasal corticosteroids with other inhaled corticosteroids could increase the risk of signs or symptoms of hypercorticism and/or suppression of the HPA axis.</p><p>The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency, and in addition some patients may experience symptoms of withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, too rapid a decrease in systemic corticosteroids may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms.</p><h3>Use of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Ritonavir and other strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects.</p><p>Use caution with the coadministration of Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Effect on Growth</h3><p class="First">Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</span>].</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Systemic and local corticosteroid use may result in the following:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older</span></p><p>The safety data described below in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older reflect exposure to azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in 853 patients (12 years of age and older; 36% male and 64% female) with seasonal allergic rhinitis in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2-week duration.

The individual components of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have been marketed for decades.</p><p>While the data regarding the use of nasal preparations of fluticasone propionate in pregnancy are limited, data from clinical studies of inhaled fluticasone propionate do not indicate an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.</p><p>Animal reproduction studies with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray are not available; however, studies are available with its individual components, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm in animals at oral doses of azelastine hydrochloride approximately 10 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 530 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 0.548 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, fluticasone propionate administered via nose-only inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Teratogenicity, characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal variations, in rats, mice, and rabbits were observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the MRHDID of 200 mcg on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Experience with corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Azelastine hydrochloride:</span> In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 610 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight.

Fluticasone propionate is present in rat milk <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Other corticosteroids have been detected in human milk. However, fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after intranasal therapeutic doses are low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Monitoring for Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Breastfed infants of lactating women treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be monitored for possible signs of milk rejection related to the bitter taste of azelastine hydrochloride.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>Subcutaneous administration of 10 mcg/kg of tritiated fluticasone propionate to lactating rats resulted in measurable radioactivity in the milk.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Use of Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray for seasonal allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is supported by safety and efficacy data from clinical studies (416 patients 6 to 11 years of age with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in controlled clinical trials) and the established efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in this age group [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14)</span>].</p><p>Sixty-one patients ages 4-5 years of age were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in the pediatric studies described above. Safety findings in children 4-5 years of age were similar to those in children 6-11 years of age, but efficacy was not established.</p><p>Safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray has not been studied in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years.</p><p>Controlled clinical studies have shown that intranasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with intranasal corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for “catch-up” growth following discontinuation of treatment with intranasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving intranasal corticosteroids, including Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks/benefits of treatment alternatives.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray</span>: Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray.</p><p><span class="Bold">Azelastine hydrochloride</span>: There have been no reported overdosages with azelastine hydrochloride. Acute azelastine hydrochloride overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse events, other than increased somnolence, since one (1) 23 g bottle of Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray contains approximately 23 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. Clinical trials in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (up to 16 mg) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse events. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in children. Accordingly, Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray should be kept out of the reach of children.</p><p><span class="Bold">Fluticasone propionate</span>: Chronic fluticasone propionate overdosage may result in signs/symptoms of hypercorticism [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span>]. Intranasal administration of 2 mg (10 times the recommended dose) of fluticasone propionate twice daily for 7 days to healthy human volunteers was well tolerated. Single oral fluticasone propionate doses up to 16 mg have been studied in human volunteers with no acute toxic effects reported. Repeat oral doses up to 80 mg daily for 10 days in volunteers and repeat oral doses up to 10 mg daily for 14 days in patients were well tolerated. Adverse reactions were of mild or moderate severity, and incidences were similar in active and placebo treatment groups. Acute overdosage with this dosage form is unlikely since one (1) 23 g bottle of Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray contains approximately 8.5 mg of fluticasone propionate.</p><h2>Azelastine and Fluticasone Nasal Spray Description</h2><p class="First">Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is formulated as a white, uniform metered-spray suspension for intranasal administration. It is a fixed dose combination product containing an antihistamine (H<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor antagonist) and a corticosteroid as active ingredients.</p><p>Azelastine hydrochloride active ingredient occurs as a white, odorless, crystalline powder with a bitter taste.

These drugs represent two different classes of medications (histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptor antagonist and synthetic corticosteroid).</p><p><span class="Bold">Azelastine hydrochloride</span>: Azelastine hydrochloride, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride in Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, also possesses H<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptor antagonist activity.</p><p><span class="Bold">Fluticasone propionate</span>: Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> dose response studies on a cloned human glucocorticoid receptor system involving binding and gene expression afforded 50% responses at 1.25 and 0.17 nM concentrations, respectively. Fluticasone propionate was 3-fold to 5-fold more potent than dexamethasone in these assays. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man also support its potent glucocorticoid activity. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.</p><p>The precise mechanism through which fluticasone propionate affects allergic rhinitis symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Effects</span>:</p><p>In a placebo-controlled trial (95 patients with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively.</p><p>Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption:</span> After intranasal administration of two sprays per nostril (548 mcg of azelastine hydrochloride and 200 mcg of fluticasone) of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the mean (± standard deviation) peak plasma exposure (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 194.5 ± 74.4 pg/mL for azelastine and 10.3±3.9 pg/mL for fluticasone propionate and the mean total exposure (AUC) was 4217 ± 2618 pg/mL*hr for azelastine and 97.7 ± 43.1 pg/mL*hr for fluticasone. The median time to peak exposure (t<span class="Sub">max</span>) from a single dose was 0.5 hours for azelastine and 1.0 hours for fluticasone.</p><p>Systemic bioavailability of azelastine from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following intranasal administration was comparable with monotherapy azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray without sweetener (i.e., approximately 40%). Systemic bioavailability of fluticasone from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following intranasal administration was 44-61% higher than monotherapy fluticasone propionate (bioavailability for monotherapy fluticasone nasal spray was less than 2%). Due to the low intranasal bioavailability, pharmacokinetic data for fluticasone propionate were obtained via other routes of administration. Studies using oral dosing of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate showed negligible oral bioavailability and high extraction from plasma. The majority of the circulating radioactivity was due to an inactive metabolite.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution:</span> Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution of azelastine hydrochloride is 14.5 L/kg. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine hydrochloride and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively.</p><p>Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg.</p><p>The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91% with no obvious concentration relationship. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and freely equilibrates between erythrocytes and plasma. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism:</span> Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. The total clearance of azelastine is approximately 0.50 L/kg/hr.</p><p>For fluticasone propionate, the only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17β-carboxylic acid derivative, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This inactive metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. The average total clearance of fluticasone propionate is relatively high (approximately 66 L/hr).</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination:</span> Following intranasal administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the elimination half-life of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 25 hours. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine.</p><p>Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Populations:</span></p><p>Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not studied in any special populations, and no gender-specific pharmacokinetic data have been obtained.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span>: Following oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span>: Based on oral, single-dose studies of azelastine hydrochloride, renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min) resulted in a 70-75% higher C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC compared to healthy subjects.

Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (&lt;10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range, 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC(0-τ) averaged 8.43 pg•hr/mL (range, 4.2 to 18.8 pg•hr/mL). Fluticasone propionate C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC(0-τ) increased to 318 pg/mL (range, 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg•hr/mL (range, 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg•hr/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in plasma cortisol area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC).</p><p>Caution should be exercised when other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are coadministered with fluticasone propionate. In a drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in increased fluticasone propionate exposure and reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol.

The azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate comparators use the same device and vehicle as azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and are not commercially marketed. Assessment of efficacy was based on the reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS), in addition to the instantaneous total nasal symptom score (iTNSS) and other supportive secondary efficacy variables. TNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients’ scoring of the 4 individual nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, and nasal itching) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Patients were required to record symptom severity daily reflecting over the previous 12 hours (morning, AM, and evening, PM). For the primary efficacy endpoint, the combined AM+PM rTNSS (maximum score of 24) was assessed as a change from baseline for each day and then averaged over a 2 -week treatment period.

Onset of action was observed as early as 30 minutes following the initial dose of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray.</p><p>The subjective impact of seasonal allergic rhinitis on patient’s health-related quality of life was evaluated by the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) (28 items in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional) evaluated on a 7-point scale where 0=no impairment and 6=maximum impairment), which was administered to patients 18 years of age and older. An overall RQLQ score is calculated from the mean of all items in the instrument. A change from baseline of at least 0.5 points is considered a clinically meaningful improvement. In each of these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray demonstrated a statistically significant greater decrease from baseline in the overall RQLQ than placebo, which ranged from -0.55 (95% CI -0.72, -0.39) to -0.80 (95% CI -1.05, -0.55). In these trials, the treatment differences between azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and the monotherapies were less than the minimum important difference of 0.5 points.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients 6-11 Years of Age</span></p><p>The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was evaluated in one randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 304 children 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either one spray per nostril twice daily of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or placebo (vehicle control) for 14 days. The design of this trial was similar to that of the adult trials.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) over 2 weeks. Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not statistically significantly different than placebo, but the results were numerically supportive (Table 5).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Table 5: Mean Change from Baseline in Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Scores over 2 Weeks in Children age 6 to 11 years</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Baseline</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">LS Mean</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Change from baseline</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">LS Mean Difference (95% CI)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">P-value</span></p><p class="First">Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray</p><p>N=152</p><p class="First">18.4</p><p class="First">-3.7</p><p class="First">-0.8</p><p>(-1.8, 0.2)</p><p class="First">0.099</p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p>N-152</p><p class="First">18.0</p><p class="First">-2.9</p><p class="First">CI = confidence interval</p><p>LS Mean, 95% CI, and p-value are obtained from the repeated-measures analysis of covariance model using observed data</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray (NDC 45802-066-01) is supplied as an amber glass bottle fitted with a metered-dose spray pump unit.
