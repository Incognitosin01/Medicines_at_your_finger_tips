In type 2 diabetes, your body does not work properly to store excess sugar and the sugar remains in your blood. High blood sugar over a long time can lead to serious health problems.</p><p>Proper diet is the first step in managing type 2 diabetes, but often medicines are needed. Chlorpropamide belongs to a class of drugs called sulfonylureas. It increases the release of insulin from the pancreas, which helps your body store sugar. This also lowers the level of sugar in the blood and restores the way you use food to make energy.</p><p>Chlorpropamide is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using chlorpropamide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For chlorpropamide, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to chlorpropamide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of chlorpropamide in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of chlorpropamide have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of chlorpropamide in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver or kidney problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving chlorpropamide.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking chlorpropamide, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using chlorpropamide with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide whether you should continue to take it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>It is very important to carefully follow any instructions from your health care team about:</p><ul>
<li>Alcohol—Drinking alcohol may cause severe low blood sugar. Discuss this with your health care team.</li>
<li>Counseling—Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Also, patients with diabetes may need special counseling about diabetes medicine dosing changes that might occur because of lifestyle changes, such as changes in exercise and diet. Furthermore, counseling on contraception and pregnancy may be needed because of the problems that can occur in patients with diabetes during pregnancy.</li>
<li>Travel—Keep your recent prescription and your medical history with you. Be prepared for an emergency as you would normally. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times.</li>
<li>In case of an emergency—There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says you have diabetes and a list of all of your medicines.</li>
</ul><p>Check with your doctor right away if you start having chest pain or discomfort; nausea; pain or discomfort in arms, jaw, back, or neck; shortness of breath; sweating; or vomiting while you are using chlorpropamide. These may be symptoms of a serious heart problem, including a heart attack.</p><p>Chlorpropamide can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). However, this can also occur if you delay or miss a meal or snack, drink alcohol, exercise more than usual, cannot eat because of nausea or vomiting, take certain medicines, or take chlorpropamide with another type of diabetes medicine. <i>The symptoms of low blood sugar must be treated before they lead to unconsciousness (passing out)</i>. Different people feel different symptoms of low blood sugar. <i>It is important that you learn which symptoms of low blood sugar you usually have, so you can treat it quickly</i>.</p><p>Symptoms of low blood sugar include anxiety; behavior change similar to being drunk; blurred vision; cold sweats; confusion; cool, pale skin; difficulty with thinking; drowsiness; excessive hunger; fast heartbeat; headache (continuing); nausea; nervousness; nightmares; restless sleep; shakiness; slurred speech; or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>If symptoms of low blood sugar occur, eat glucose tablets or gel, corn syrup, honey, or sugar cubes; or drink fruit juice, non-diet soft drink, or sugar dissolved in water. Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Glucagon is used in emergency situations when severe symptoms such as seizures (convulsions) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe or needle, and know how to use it. Members of your household also should know how to use it.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Chlorpropamide side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
