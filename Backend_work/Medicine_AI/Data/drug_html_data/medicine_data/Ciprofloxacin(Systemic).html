Based on the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, the National Marrow Donor Program, the European Blood and Marrow Transplant Group, and multiple other organizations guidelines for preventing infectious complications among hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, oral ciprofloxacin may be used in adult HCT recipients to prevent bacterial infections in the first 100 days after transplant when the anticipated period of neutropenia is ≥7 days.</p><h3>Neutropenic fever, low-risk cancer patients (empiric therapy)</h3><p>Data from 3 randomized trials (blinding varied) support the use of oral ciprofloxacin (in combination with amoxicillin and clavulanate) for the outpatient empiric management of low-risk neutropenic fever <sup>[Freifeld 1999]</sup>, <sup>[Kern 1999]</sup>, <sup>[Kern 2013]</sup>. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and IDSA guidelines for outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in adults treated for malignancy and the IDSA guidelines for use of antimicrobial agents in neutropenic patients with cancer also support oral ciprofloxacin use (in combination with amoxicillin and clavulanate) in this patient population. Use should be avoided in patients who have received fluoroquinolone prophylaxis.</p><h3>Peritoneal dialysis catheter-related infection</h3><p>Based on the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis catheter-related infection recommendations, ciprofloxacin is an effective and recommended agent for the management of peritoneal dialysis catheter exit-site or tunnel infection.</p><h3>Peritonitis, spontaneous bacterial (prevention)</h3><p>Limited data from a meta-analysis and controlled trials suggest that ciprofloxacin may be an alternative to norfloxacin for primary long-term prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients with low ascitic fluid protein concentration or as secondary long-term prophylaxis in patients who have experienced a prior SBP episode <sup>[Loomba 2009]</sup>, <sup>[Rolachon 1995]</sup>, <sup>[Terg 2008]</sup>.</p><p>American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines on the management of adult patients with ascites due to cirrhosis and European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis mention studies evaluating ciprofloxacin use for prevention of SBP, but ciprofloxacin is not included in final guideline recommendations. Increasing bacterial resistance rates to antibiotics used in the treatment and prevention of SBP have been documented; therefore, local epidemiological patterns should be considered, and use of antibiotic prophylaxis should be restricted to patients at high risk of SBP <sup>[AASLD [Runyon 2012]]</sup>, <sup>[EASL 2018]</sup>. </p><h3>Prostatitis, acute bacterial</h3><p>Data from a limited number of patients studied suggest that ciprofloxacin may be beneficial for the treatment of acute bacterial prostatitis <sup>[Ulleryd 2003]</sup>.</p><p>Clinical experience also suggests the utility of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial prostatitis <sup>[Coker 2016]</sup>.</p><h3>Prosthetic joint infection</h3><p>Based on the IDSA guidelines for the management of prosthetic joint infection, ciprofloxacin is an effective and recommended agent for treatment of prosthetic joint infection with either <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Enterobacter</i> spp, or Enterobacteriaceae.

Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately and avoid the use of fluoroquinolones in patients who experience any of these serious adverse reactions. Because fluoroquinolones have been associated with serious adverse reactions, reserve ciprofloxacin for use in patients who have no alternative treatment options for the following indications: acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, acute sinusitis, and acute uncomplicated cystitis.</p><p>Fluoroquinolones may exacerbate muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. Avoid ciprofloxacin in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Altered cardiac conduction: Fluoroquinolones may prolong QT<sub>c</sub> interval; avoid use in patients with a history of or at risk for QT<sub>c</sub> prolongation, torsades de pointes, uncorrected electrolyte disorders (hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), cardiac disease (heart failure, myocardial infarction, bradycardia) or concurrent administration of other medications known to prolong the QT interval (including Class Ia and Class III antiarrhythmics, cisapride, erythromycin, antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants).</p><p>• Aortic aneurysm and dissection: Fluoroquinolones have been associated with aortic aneurysm ruptures or dissection within 2 months following use, particularly in elderly patients. Fluoroquinolones should not be used in patients with a known history of aortic aneurysm or those at increased risk, including patients with peripheral atherosclerotic vascular diseases, hypertension, genetic disorders involving blood vessel changes (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), and elderly patients, unless no other treatment options are available. Longer treatment duration (eg, &gt;14 days) may increase risk (Lee 2018).</p><p>• Crystalluria: Rarely, crystalluria has occurred; urine alkalinity may increase the risk. Ensure adequate hydration during therapy.</p><p>• Glucose regulation: Fluoroquinolones have been associated with disturbances in glucose regulation, including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. These events have occurred most often in patients receiving concomitant oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin. Severe cases of hypoglycemia, including coma and death, have been reported. Diabetic patients should be monitored closely for signs/symptoms of disordered glucose regulation. Discontinue if a hypoglycemic reaction occurs and immediately initiate appropriate therapy.</p><p>• Hepatotoxicity: Hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed liver injury has been reported, including hepatic necrosis, life-threatening hepatic events, and fatalities. Acute liver injury can be rapid onset (range: 1 to 39 days) and is often associated with hypersensitivity. The pattern of injury can be hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed. Most fatalities occurred in patients &gt;55 years of age. Discontinue immediately if signs/symptoms of hepatitis (abdominal tenderness, dark urine, jaundice, pruritus) occur. Additionally, temporary increases in transaminases or alkaline phosphatase, or cholestatic jaundice may occur (highest risk in patients with previous liver damage).</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred with fluoroquinolone therapy. The spectrum of these reactions can vary widely; reactions may present as typical allergic symptoms (eg, itching, urticaria, rash, edema) after a single dose, or may manifest as severe idiosyncratic dermatologic (eg, Stevens-Johnson, toxic epidermal necrolysis), vascular (eg, vasculitis), pulmonary (eg, pneumonitis), renal (eg, nephritis), hepatic (eg, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatic failure or necrosis), and/or hematologic (eg, anemia, cytopenias) events, usually after multiple doses. Prompt discontinuation of drug should occur if skin rash or other symptoms arise.</p><p>• Photosensitivity/phototoxicity: Avoid excessive sunlight and take precautions to limit exposure (eg, loose fitting clothing, sunscreen); may cause moderate-to-severe phototoxicity reactions which may appear as exaggerated sunburn reactions. Discontinue use if phototoxicity occurs.</p><p>• Serious adverse reactions: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Fluoroquinolones are associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions that may occur together, including tendinopathy and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and CNS effects. Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately and avoid use of fluoroquinolones in patients who experience any of these serious adverse reactions.</b> Patients of any age or without preexisting risk factors have experienced these reactions; may occur within hours to weeks after initiation.</p><p>- CNS effects: Fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of CNS effects, including seizures, increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri), dizziness, and tremors. Status epilepticus cases have been reported. Use with caution in patients with a history of seizures, with known or suspected CNS disorder (severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, previous history of convulsion, reduced cerebral blood flow, altered brain structure, or stroke), or with other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (eg, certain drug therapy, renal dysfunction). Discontinue if seizures occur and institute appropriate therapy.</p><p>- Peripheral neuropathy: Fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy; may occur soon after initiation of therapy and may be irreversible; discontinue immediately if symptoms of sensory or sensorimotor neuropathy occur. Avoid use in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy.</p><p>- Psychiatric reactions: Fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of psychiatric reactions, including toxic psychosis, hallucinations, or paranoia; may also cause nervousness, agitation, delirium, attention disturbances, insomnia, anxiety, nightmares, memory impairment, confusion, depression, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Use with caution in patients with a history of or risk factor for mental illness. Reactions may appear following the first dose; discontinue if reaction occurs and institute appropriate therapy.</p><p>- Tendinopathy/tendon rupture: Fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of tendinopathy and tendon rupture in all ages; risk may be increased with concurrent corticosteroids, solid organ transplant recipients, and in patients &gt;60 years of age, but has also occurred in patients without these risk factors. Rupture of the Achilles tendon has been reported most frequently; but other tendon sites (eg, rotator cuff, biceps, hand) have also been reported. Inflammation and rupture may occur bilaterally. Cases have been reported within hours or days of initiation, and up to several months after discontinuation of therapy. Strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders may be independent risk factor for tendon rupture. Discontinue at first sign of tendon pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture. Avoid use in patients with a history of tendon disorders or who have experienced tendinopathy or tendon rupture.</p><p>• Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including <i>C. difficile</i>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed &gt;2 months postantibiotic treatment.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Myasthenia gravis: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: May exacerbate muscle weakness related to myasthenia gravis; avoid use in patients with a known history of myasthenia gravis.</b> Cases of severe exacerbations, including the need for ventilatory support and deaths have been reported.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; dosage adjustment required. May increase risk of tendon rupture.</p><p>• Rheumatoid arthritis: Use with caution in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; may increase risk of tendon rupture.</p><p>• Syphilis: Since ciprofloxacin is ineffective in the treatment of syphilis and may mask symptoms, all patients should be tested for syphilis at the time of gonorrheal diagnosis and 3 months later.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Elderly: Adverse effects (eg, tendon rupture, QT changes) may be increased in elderly patients.</p><p>• G6PD deficiency: Hemolytic reactions may (rarely) occur with fluoroquinolone use in patients with G6PD deficiency (Luzzatto 2020).</p><p>• Pediatric: Adverse effects, including those related to joints and/or surrounding tissues, are increased in pediatric patients and therefore, ciprofloxacin should not be considered as drug of choice in children (exception is anthrax treatment).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Reserve use of ciprofloxacin for treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, or acute uncomplicated cystitis for patients who have no alternative treatment options because of the risk of disabling and potentially serious adverse reactions (eg, tendinopathy and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, CNS effects).</b></p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC, renal and hepatic function during prolonged therapy, altered mental status, signs and symptoms of tendinopathy; signs and symptoms of disordered glucose regulation</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Ciprofloxacin crosses the placenta and produces measurable concentrations in the amniotic fluid and cord serum (Ludlam 1997).</p><p>Based on available data, an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse fetal and maternal outcomes have not been observed following ciprofloxacin use during pregnancy.</p><p>Due to pregnancy-induced physiologic changes, some pharmacokinetic properties of ciprofloxacin may be altered.
