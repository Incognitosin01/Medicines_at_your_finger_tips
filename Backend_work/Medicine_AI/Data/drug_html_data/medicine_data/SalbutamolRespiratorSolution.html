It is also used to prevent bronchospasm caused by exercise.</p><p>Albuterol belongs to the family of medicines known as adrenergic bronchodilators. Adrenergic bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Salbutamol Respirator Solution</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>albuterol inhalation aerosol</i> (eg, ProAir® HFA, Proventil® HFA) in children 4 years of age and older, <i>albuterol inhalation powder</i> (eg, ProAir® Digihaler™, ProAir® Respiclick®) in children 4 years of age and older, and <i>albuterol inhalation solution</i> (eg, Accuneb®) in children 2 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established for the <i>albuterol inhalation aerosol and albuterol inhalation powder</i> in children younger than 4 years of age, and <i>albuterol inhalation solution</i> in children younger than 2 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Proventil® HFA</i> in the geriatric population. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related heart problems, which may require caution in the dose for patients receiving <i>Proventil® HFA</i>.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>ProAir® Digihaler™</i>, <i>ProAir® HFA</i>, and <i>ProAir® Respiclick®</i> in geriatric patients.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Salbutamol Respirator Solution</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain albuterol.  It may not be specific to Salbutamol Respirator Solution. Please read with care.</b></p><p><i>Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using this medicine or any asthma medicine without telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance for breathing problems.</p><p>The <i>albuterol inhalation solution</i> (eg, Accuneb®) should be used with a jet nebulizer that is connected to an air compressor with good air flow. The inhalation solution and nebulizer will come with patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>To use the <i>inhalation solution in the nebulizer</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Use one container of solution or mix the exact amount of solution using the dropper provided for each dose.</li>
<li>Place the inhalation solution in the medicine reservoir or nebulizer cup on the machine.</li>
<li>Connect the nebulizer to the face mask or mouthpiece.</li>
<li>Use the face mask or mouthpiece to breathe in the medicine.</li>
<li>Use the nebulizer for about 5 to 15 minutes, or until the medicine in the nebulizer cup is gone.</li>
<li>Clean all the parts of the nebulizer after each use.</li>
</ul><p>The <i>albuterol inhalation aerosol</i> (eg, ProAir® HFA, Proventil® HFA) and <i>albuterol inhalation powder</i> (eg, ProAir® Digihaler™, ProAir® Respiclick®) are used with a special inhaler that comes with patient instructions. Read the directions carefully before using this medicine. If you or your child do not understand the directions or are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your doctor to show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check regularly how you or your child use the inhaler to make sure you are using it properly.</p><p>To use the <i>inhalation aerosol</i>:</p><ul>
<li>The inhaler should be at room temperature before you use it.</li>
<li>Insert the metal canister firmly and fully into the actuator. This actuator should not be used with other inhaled medicines.</li>
<li>Remove the cap and look at the mouthpiece to make sure it is clean.</li>
<li>Point the inhaler away from your face. Shake the inhaler well and test spray it in the air 3 times for ProAir® HFA or 4 times for Proventil® HFA before using it for the first time or if the inhaler has not been used for more than 2 weeks.</li>
<li>To inhale this medicine, breathe out fully, trying to get as much air out of the lungs as possible. Put the mouthpiece just in front of your mouth with the canister upright.</li>
<li>Open your mouth and breathe in slowly and deeply (like yawning), and at the same time firmly press down once on the top of the canister.</li>
<li>Hold your breath for about 10 seconds, then breathe out slowly.</li>
<li>If you are supposed to use more than one puff, wait 1 minute before inhaling the second puff. Repeat these steps for the second puff, starting with shaking the inhaler.</li>
<li>When you have finished all of your doses, rinse your mouth with water and spit the water out.</li>
<li>Clean the inhaler mouthpiece at least once a week with warm running water for 30 seconds, and air dry it completely.</li>
<li>If you need to use the inhaler before it is completely dry, shake off the excess water, replace the canister, and spray it 2 times in the air away from the face. Use your regular dose.</li>
<li>After using the inhaler, wash the mouthpiece again and dry it completely.</li>
<li>If the mouthpiece becomes blocked, washing it will help.</li>
<li>The Proventil® HFA inhaler has a window that shows the number of doses remaining. This tells you when you are getting low on medicine. The counter will turn red when there are only 20 doses left, to remind you to refill your prescription.</li>
</ul><p>To use the <i>inhalation powder</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Take the inhaler from the foil pouch before you use it for the first time.</li>
<li>The inhaler provides about 200 inhalations. The dose counter will change to red when there are "20" doses left. Call your doctor or pharmacist for a refill of prescription or medicine.</li>
<li>Make sure the cap is closed before using this medicine. Do not open the cap unless you are going to use it.</li>
<li>Hold the inhaler upright as you open the cap fully until you hear a "click". Your inhaler is now ready to use.</li>
<li>To inhale this medicine, breathe out fully, trying to get as much air out of the lungs as possible. Put the mouthpiece fully into your mouth and close your lips around it.</li>
<li>Breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath.</li>
<li>Do not block the vent above the mouthpiece with your lips or fingers.</li>
<li>Hold your breath for about 10 seconds or as long as you comfortably can.</li>
<li>Remove the inhaler from your mouth and check the dose counter to make sure you received the medicine.</li>
<li>Close the cap firmly over the mouthpiece after using the inhaler. Always close the cap after each use.</li>
<li>If you are supposed to use more than one puff, repeat these steps for the second puff, starting with opening the cap fully.</li>
<li>Do not use a spacer or volume holding chamber together with the ProAir® Digihaler™.</li>
<li>Keep the inhaler clean and dry at all times. Do not wash or put any part of the inhaler in water. Replace the ProAir® Digihaler™ if it has been washed or placed in water.</li>
<li>If you need to clean the mouthpiece, wipe it gently with a dry cloth or tissue.</li>
