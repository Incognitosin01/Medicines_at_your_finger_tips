Severe neutropenia can lead to serious infection and death. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine, a</span><span class="Bold"> baseline ANC must be at least 1500/μL for the general population; and must be at least 1000/μL for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). During treatment, patients must have regular ANC monitoring. Advise patients to immediately report symptoms consistent with severe neutropenia or infection (e.g., fever, weakness, lethargy, or sore throat) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Because of the risk of severe neutropenia, clozapine is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Clozapine REMS Program <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, Syncope</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, with doses as low as 12.5 mg per day. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once or twice daily; titrate slowly; and use divided dosages. Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or conditions predisposing to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, use of antihypertensive medications) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3, and 2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Seizures</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Seizures have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is dose-related. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg, titrate gradually, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (CNS pathology, medications that lower the seizure threshold, alcohol abuse). Caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with clozapine treatment. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of these reactions. Generally, patients with clozapine-related myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy if chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death.

Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with their use, Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.5)].</span></p><p>The effectiveness of Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets and chlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)].</span></p><h3>Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder</h3><p class="First">Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets are indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death.</p><p>The effectiveness of Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was demonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePT™ trial <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablet Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Required Laboratory Testing Prior to Initiation and During Therapy</h3><p class="First">Prior to initiating treatment with Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets, a baseline ANC must be obtained. The baseline ANC must be at least 1500/μL for the general population, and at least 1000/μL for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). To continue treatment, the ANC must be monitored regularly <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets should be immediately placed in the mouth after removing the tablet from the blister pack or bottle. The tablet disintegrates rapidly after placement in the mouth. The tablets can be allowed to disintegrate, or they may be chewed. They may be swallowed with saliva. No water is necessary for administration.</p><p>The orally disintegrating tablets in a blister pack should be left in the unopened blister until the time of use. Just prior to use, peel the foil from the blister and gently remove the orally disintegrating tablet. Do not push the tablets through the foil, because this could damage the tablet.</p><h3>Dosing Information</h3><p class="First">The starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to achieve a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased once weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. To minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, it is necessary to use this low starting dose, gradual titration schedule, and divided dosages <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><p>Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets can be taken with or without food <span class="Italics">[see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Maintenance Treatment</h3><p class="First">Generally, patients responding to Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets should continue maintenance treatment on their effective dose beyond the acute episode.</p><h3>Discontinuation of Treatment</h3><p class="First">Method of treatment discontinuation will vary depending on the patient’s last ANC:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>See Tables 2 or 3 for appropriate ANC monitoring based on the level of neutropenia if abrupt treatment discontinuation is necessary because of moderate to severe neutropenia.</li>
<li>Reduce the dose gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks if termination of clozapine therapy is planned and there is no evidence of moderate to severe neutropenia.</li>
<li>For abrupt clozapine discontinuation for a reason unrelated to neutropenia, continuation of the existing ANC monitoring is recommended for general population patients until their ANC is ≥1500/μL and for BEN patients until their ANC is ≥1000/μL or above their baseline.</li>
<li>Additional ANC monitoring is required for any patient reporting onset of fever (temperature of 38.5°C or 101.3°F, or greater) during the 2 weeks after discontinuation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></li>
<li>Monitor all patients carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and symptoms related to cholinergic rebound such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.</li>
</ul><h3>Re-Initiation of Treatment</h3><p class="First">When restarting Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets in patients who have discontinued Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate with 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span> If that dose is well-tolerated, the dose may be increased to the previously therapeutic dose more quickly than recommended for initial treatment.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustments with Concomitant use of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 Inhibitors or CYP1A2, CYP3A4 Inducers</h3><p class="First">Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with concomitant use of: strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin); moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., oral contraceptives, or caffeine); CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline); CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John’s wort, and rifampin); or CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoking) (Table 1) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.  </p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Co-medications</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Scenarios</span></p><p class="First">Initiating Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets while taking a co-medication</p><p class="First">Adding a co-medication while taking Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets</p><p class="First">Discontinuing a</p><p>co-medication while continuing Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets</p><p class="First">Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors</p><p class="First">Use one third of the Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets dose.</p><p class="First">Increase Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets dose based on clinical response.</p><p class="First">Moderate or Weak CYP1A2 Inhibitors</p><p class="First">Monitor for adverse reactions.

The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: <span class="Italics">ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil “segs” plus neutrophil “bands”).</span> Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span> Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, “severe neutropenia” replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis.</p><p>Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<span class="Bold">&lt;</span>) 500/μL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent.</p><p>Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia.</p><p class="First">Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with clozapine to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/μL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (≥)1500/μL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient’s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ANC Level</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clozapine</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment Recommendations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ANC Monitoring</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Normal range</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(≥1500/μL)</span></p><ul class="Disk">

</ul><p class="First">Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than “standard” laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25 to 50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine treatment as necessary.</p><p>Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for clozapine management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing clozapine treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ANC Level</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment Recommendations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ANC Monitoring</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Normal BEN Range</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(Established ANC baseline ≥1000/μL)</span></p><ul class="Disk">

<li>Fever: Interrupt clozapine as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5°C [101.3°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection.</li>

<li>Consider hematology consultation.</li>
<li>See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) and Fever under WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17).</li>
</ul><p class="First">For some patients who experience severe clozapine-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g. patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets or a clozapine product.</p><p>If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient’s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode.</p><p class="First">It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy.</p><h3>Clozapine REMS Program</h3><p class="First">Clozapine is only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia.</p><p>Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Healthcare professionals who prescribe clozapine must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training.</li>
<li>Patients who receive clozapine must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements.</li>
<li>Pharmacies dispensing clozapine must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive clozapine.</li>
</ul><p>Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678.</p><h3>Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope</h3><p class="First">Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB).</p><p>Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a brief interval off clozapine (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].</span></p><p>Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia).</p><h3>Falls</h3><p class="First">Clozapine may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic treatment.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing.</p><p>Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing).</p><h3>Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy</h3><p class="First">Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. However, if the benefit of clozapine treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring.</p><p>Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving clozapine who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first two months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction.</p><h3>Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning]</span>.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Hypomotility with Severe Complications</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions have occurred with the use of clozapine, primarily due to its potent anticholinergic effects and resulting gastrointestinal hypomotility. In post marketing experience, reported effects range from constipation to paralytic ileus. Increased frequency of constipation and delayed diagnosis and treatment increased the risk of severe complications of gastrointestinal hypomotility, resulting in intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, megacolon and intestinal ischemia or infarction <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. These reactions have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and death. The risk for severe adverse reactions is further increased with anticholinergic medications (and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis); therefore, concomitant use should be avoided when possible <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.16), Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Prior to initiating clozapine, screen for constipation and treat as necessary. Subjective symptoms of constipation may not accurately reflect the degree of gastrointestinal hypomotility in clozapine treated patients. Therefore, reassess bowel function frequently with careful attention to any changes in the frequency or character of bowel movements, as well as signs and symptoms of complications of hypomotility (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain). If constipation or gastrointestinal hypomotility are identified, monitor closely and treat promptly with appropriate laxatives, as necessary, to prevent severe complications. Consider prophylactic laxatives in high risk patients.</span></p><h3>Eosinophilia</h3><p class="First">Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/μL, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine immediately.</p><p>If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine.</p><p>Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist.</p><h3>QT Interval Prolongation</h3><p class="First">QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing clozapine, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities.</p><p>Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine.</p><p>Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine.</p><h3>Metabolic Changes</h3><p class="First">Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus</span></span></p><p>Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.</p><p>Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.</p><p>In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100 to 900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Laboratory<br/>

Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine, is recommended.</p><p>In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment Arm</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Baseline Total Cholesterol<br/>

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure.</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever).</p><p>The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of co-morbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS.</p><p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics.</p><p>NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in patients treated with clozapine <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to clozapine.</p><h3>Fever</h3><p class="First">During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].</span></p><h3>Pulmonary Embolism</h3><p class="First">Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear.</p><h3>Anticholinergic Toxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Clozapine has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages, or in overdose situations <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>. Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</span></p><h3>Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance</h3><p class="First">Clozapine can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur.</p><h3>Tardive Dyskinesia</h3><p class="First">Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine despite the presence of the syndrome.</p><p>There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown.</p><h3>Patients with Phenylketonuria</h3><p class="First">Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 12.5 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 1.4 mg phenylalanine. Each 25 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 2.8 mg phenylalanine. Each 100 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 11.2 mg phenylalanine.</p><h3>Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions.</p><h3>Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine</h3><p class="First">If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>, monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disk">

Use caution when administering Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes.</p><p class="First">Concomitant use of Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets dose to one third of the original dose when Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets are coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets are coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets dosage if necessary <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].</span></p><p class="First">Concomitant treatment with Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets dose <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]</span>.</p><p class="First">Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].</span></p><p>Consider reducing the Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers, because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].</span></p><p class="First">Concomitant treatment with clozapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of clozapine with anticholinergic drugs when possible <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.16)]</span>.</p><p class="First">Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]</span>.</p><h3>Potential for Clozapine to Affect Other Drugs</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of clozapine with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide).</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no adequate or well-controlled studies of clozapine in pregnant women.</p><p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area basis. The studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to clozapine. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Consider the risk of exacerbation of psychosis when discontinuing or changing treatment with antipsychotic medications during pregnancy and postpartum. Consider early screening for gestational diabetes for patients treated with antipsychotic medications <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].</span> Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Monitor neonates for symptoms of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding difficulties. The severity of complications can vary from self-limited symptoms to some neonates requiring intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.</p><p><span class="Bold">Animal Data</span></p><p>In embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter sizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area basis.</p><p>In peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over the last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at birth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and mated.

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from clozapine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing clozapine to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to clozapine.</p><p>Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine treatment <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span> Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised cardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects.</p><p>Elderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine, such as urinary retention and constipation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)].</span></p><p>Carefully select clozapine doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease and other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.18)].</span></p><h3>Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic function. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers</h3><p class="First">Dose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.

Individual treatment decisions should weigh the importance of monitoring ANC in the context of the need to control psychiatric symptoms and the patient’s terminal illness.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Overdosage Experience</h3><p class="First">The most commonly reported signs and symptoms associated with clozapine overdose are: sedation, delirium, coma, tachycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression or failure; and hypersalivation. There are reports of aspiration pneumonia, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizure. Fatal overdoses have been reported with clozapine, generally at doses above 2500 mg. There have also been reports of patients recovering from overdoses well in excess of 4 g.</p><h3>Management of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">There are no specific antidotes for clozapine. Establish and maintain an airway; ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Monitor cardiac status and vital signs. Use general symptomatic and supportive measures. Consider the possibility of multiple-drug involvement.</p><p>Contact a Certified Poison Control Center for the most up to date information on the management of overdosage (1-800-222-1222).</p><h2>Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablet Description</h2><p class="First">Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets, an atypical antipsychotic drug, are a tricyclic dibenzodiazepine derivative, 8-chloro-11-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-5<span class="Italics">H</span>-dibenzo [<span class="Italics">b</span>,<span class="Italics">e</span>] [1,4] diazepine.

The remaining components are aspartame powder, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, peppermint flavor, sodium stearyl fumarate and xylitol.</p><p>THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS ASPARTAME AND IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE BY INFANTS. PHENYLKETONURICS: CONTAINS PHENYLALANINE [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.19)]</span>. Phenylalanine is a component of aspartame. Each 12.5 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 2.5 mg aspartame, thus, 1.4 mg phenylalanine. Each 25 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 5 mg aspartame, thus, 2.8 mg phenylalanine. Each 100 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 20 mg aspartame, thus, 11.2 mg phenylalanine. The allowable daily intake of aspartame is 50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day.</p><h2>Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablet - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of clozapine in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D<span class="Sub">2</span>) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span>) receptors. Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets also act as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span> 1.1 nM), adrenergic α<span class="Sub">1A</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span> 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">6</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span> 4 nM<span class="Bold">)</span>, serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span> 5.4 nM), muscarinic M<span class="Sub">1</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span> 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">7</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span> 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">2C</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span> 9.4 nM), dopamine D<span class="Sub">4</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span> 24 nM), adrenergic α<span class="Sub">2A</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span> 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span> 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span> 120 nM), dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span> 160 nM), dopamine D<span class="Sub">1</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span> 270 nM), dopamine D<span class="Sub">5</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span> 454 nM), and dopamine D<span class="Sub">3</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span> 555 nM).</p><p>Clozapine causes little or no prolactin elevation.</p><p>Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) studies demonstrated that clozapine increases delta and theta activity and slows dominant alpha frequencies. Enhanced synchronization occurs. Sharp wave activity and spike and wave complexes may also develop. Patients have reported an intensification of dream activity during clozapine therapy. REM sleep was found to be increased to 85% of the total sleep time. In these patients, the onset of REM sleep occurred almost immediately after falling asleep.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">In man, clozapine tablets (25 mg and 100 mg) are equally bioavailable relative to a clozapine solution. Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets are bioequivalent to Clozaril<span class="Sup">®</span> (clozapine) tablets, a registered trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Following a dosage of 100 mg b.i.d., the average steady-state peak plasma concentration was 413 ng/mL (range: 132 to 854 ng/mL), occurring at the average of 2.3 hours (range: 1 to 6 hours) after dosing. The average minimum concentration at steady-state was 168 ng/mL (range: 45 to 574 ng/mL), after 100 mg b.i.d. dosing.</p><p>A comparative bioequivalence/bioavailability study was conducted in 32 patients (with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) comparing clozapine orally disintegrating 200 mg tablets to 2 × clozapine orally disintegrating 100 mg tablets (the approved reference product) under fasted conditions. The study also evaluated the effect of food and chewing on the pharmacokinetics of the 200 mg tablet. Under fasted conditions, the mean AUC<span class="Sub">ss</span> and C<span class="Sub">min,ss</span> of clozapine for the 200 mg tablets were equivalent to those of the 2 x 100 mg tablets. The mean C<span class="Sub">max,ss</span> of clozapine for clozapine orally disintegrating 200 mg tablets was 85% that for 2 x 100 mg Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets. This decrease in C<span class="Sub">max,ss</span> for clozapine orally disintegrating 200 mg tablets is not clinically significant.</p><p>For clozapine orally disintegrating 200 mg tablets, food significantly increased the C<span class="Sub">min,ss</span> of clozapine by 21%. However, this increase is not clinically significant. The mean AUC<span class="Sub">ss</span> and C<span class="Sub">max,ss</span> of clozapine under fed conditions were equivalent to those under fasted conditions. Food delayed clozapine absorption by 1.5 hours, from a median T<span class="Sub">max</span> of 2.5 hours under fasted conditions to 4 hours under fed conditions.</p><p>The mean C<span class="Sub">max,ss</span> of clozapine under chewed conditions for clozapine orally disintegrating 200 mg tablets was about 86% that for 2 x 100 mg Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets under non-chewed conditions, while the AUC<span class="Sub">ss</span> and C<span class="Sub">min,ss</span> values were similar between the chewed and non-chewed conditions.</p><p>In a food-effect study, a single dose of Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets 12.5 mg was administered to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and after a high-fat meal. When Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets were administered after a high-fat meal, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> of both clozapine and its active metabolite, desmethylclozapine, were decreased by approximately 20%, compared to administration under fasting conditions, while the AUC values were unchanged. This decrease in C<span class="Sub">max</span> is not clinically significant. Therefore, Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets can be taken without regard to meals.</p><p class="First">Clozapine is approximately 97% bound to serum proteins. The interaction between clozapine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated but may be important <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p class="First">Clozapine is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and only trace amounts of unchanged drug are detected in the urine and feces. Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Approximately 50% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine and 30% in the feces. The demethylated, hydroxylated, and <span class="Italics">N</span>-oxide derivatives are components in both urine and feces. Pharmacological testing has shown the desmethyl metabolite (norclozapine) to have only limited activity, while the hydroxylated and <span class="Italics">N</span>-oxide derivatives were inactive. The mean elimination half-life of clozapine after a single 75 mg dose was 8 hours (range: 4 to 12 hours), compared to a mean elimination half-life of 12 hours (range: 4 to 66 hours), after achieving steady state with 100 mg twice daily dosing.</p><p>A comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of clozapine demonstrated that the elimination half-life increased significantly after multiple dosing relative to that after single-dose administration, suggesting the possibility of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics. However, at steady state, approximately dose-proportional changes with respect to AUC (area under the curve), peak, and minimum clozapine plasma concentrations were observed after administration of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg twice daily.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Fluvoxamine</span></p><p>A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 16 schizophrenic patients who received clozapine under steady-state conditions.

The antipsychotic trials must have been judged adequate; the antipsychotic dosages must have been equivalent to or greater than 1000 mg per day of chlorpromazine for a period of at least 6 weeks, each without significant reduction of symptoms. There must have been no period of good functioning within the preceding 5 years. Patients must have had a baseline score of at least 45 on the investigator-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). On the 18-item BPRS, 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and 7 indicates severe symptoms; the maximum potential total BPRS score is 126. At baseline, the mean BPRS score was 61. In addition, patients must have had a score of at least 4 on at least two of the following four individual BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content. Patients must have had a Clinical Global Impressions – Severity Scale score of at least 4 (moderately ill).</p><p>In the prospective, lead-in phase of the trial, all patients (N=305) initially received single-blind treatment with haloperidol (the mean dose was 61 mg per day) for 6 weeks. More than 80% of patients completed the 6-week trial. Patients with an inadequate response to haloperidol (n=268) were randomized to double-blind treatment with clozapine (N=126) or chlorpromazine (N=142). The maximum daily clozapine dose was 900 mg; the mean daily dose was &gt;600 mg. The maximum daily chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg; the mean daily dose was &gt;1200 mg.</p><p>The primary endpoint was treatment response, predefined as a decrease in BPRS score of at least 20% and either (1) a CGI-S score of ≤3 (mildly ill), or (2) a BPRS score of ≤35, at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. Approximately 88% of patients from the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups completed the 6-week trial. At the end of six weeks, 30% of the clozapine group responded to treatment, and 4% of the chlorpromazine group responded to treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p &lt;0.001). The mean change in total BPRS score was -16 and -5 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; the mean change in the 4 key BPRS item scores was -5 and -2 in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively; and the mean change in CGI-S score was -1.2 and -0.4, in the clozapine and chlorpromazine group, respectively. These changes in the clozapine group were statistically significantly greater than in the chlorpromazine group (p &lt;0.001 in each analysis).</p><h3>Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder</h3><p class="First">The effectiveness of clozapine in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was assessed in the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT<span class="Sup">™</span>, a trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group comparison of clozapine (Clozaril<span class="Sup">®</span>) versus olanzapine (Zyprexa<span class="Sup">®</span>, a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company) in 956 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who were judged to be at risk for recurrent suicidal behavior. Only about one-fourth of these patients (27%) were considered resistant to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. To enter the trial, patients must have met one of the following criteria:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>They had attempted suicide within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation.</li>
<li>They had been hospitalized to prevent a suicide attempt within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation.</li>
<li>They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation with a depressive component within one week prior to their baseline evaluation.</li>
<li>They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation accompanied by command hallucinations to do self-harm within one week prior to their baseline evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>Dosing regimens for each treatment group were determined by individual investigators and were individualized by patient. Dosing was flexible, with a dose range of 200 to 900 mg/day for clozapine and 5 to 20 mg/day for olanzapine. For the 956 patients who received clozapine or olanzapine in this study, there was extensive use of concomitant psychotropics: 84% with antipsychotics, 65% with anxiolytics, 53% with antidepressants, and 28% with mood stabilizers. There was significantly greater use of concomitant psychotropic medications among the patients in the olanzapine group.</p><p>The primary efficacy measure was time to (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide; (2) hospitalization due to imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized; or (3) worsening of suicidality severity as demonstrated by “much worsening” or “very much worsening” from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality as assessed by the Blinded Psychiatrist (CGI-SS-BP) scale. A determination of whether or not a reported event met criterion 1 or 2 above was made by the Suicide Monitoring Board (SMB), a group of experts blinded to patient data.</p><p>A total of 980 patients were randomized to the study and 956 received study medication. Sixty-two percent of the patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the remainder (38%) were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Only about one-fourth of the total patient population (27%) was identified as “treatment-resistant” at baseline. There were more males than females in the study (61% of all patients were male). The mean age of patients entering the study was 37 years of age (range 18 to 69). Most patients were Caucasian (71%), 15% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 13% were classified as being of “other” races.</p><p>Patients treated with clozapine had a statistically significant longer delay in the time to recurrent suicidal behavior in comparison with olanzapine. This result should be interpreted only as evidence of the effectiveness of clozapine in delaying time to recurrent suicidal behavior and not a demonstration of the superior efficacy of clozapine over olanzapine.</p><p>The probability of experiencing (1) a significant suicide attempt, including a completed suicide, or (2) hospitalization because of imminent suicide risk, including increased level of surveillance for suicidality for patients already hospitalized, was lower for clozapine patients than for olanzapine patients at Week 104: clozapine 24% versus olanzapine 32%; 95% CI of the difference: 2%, 14% (Figure 1).</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Cumulative Probability of a Significant Suicide Attempt or Hospitalization to Prevent Suicide in Patients with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder at High Risk of Suicidality</span></p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">12.5 mg</span></p><p>Yellow, round, flat-faced, beveled-edge, unscored tablet.
