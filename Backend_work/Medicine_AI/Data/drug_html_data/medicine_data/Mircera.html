Epoetin beta and methoxy polyethylene glycol is a man-made form of a protein normally produced by the kidneys that helps your body produce red blood cells. When your body does not make enough of this protein because of kidney failure, you can develop a condition called anemia (lack of red blood cells).</p><p>Mircera is used to treat anemia (lack of red blood cells) and to reduce the need for blood cell transfusions.</p><p>Mircera is used to treat anemia caused by chronic kidney disease in adults, or in children at least 5 years old who are on hemodialysis.</p><p>This medicine is not for treating anemia caused by cancer chemotherapy. Epoetin beta and methoxy polyethylene glycol may increase tumor growth or decrease survival time in people with certain types of cancer.</p><p>Mircera should not be used to take the place of an emergency blood cell transfusion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Mircera Injection if you have uncontrolled high blood pressure or if you have ever had pure red cell aplasia.</p><p>Mircera is not for treating anemia caused by cancer chemotherapy.</p><p><b>This medicine can increase your risk of serious or fatal side effects, including heart attack, stroke, or blood clot.</b> Call your doctor or get emergency medical help if you have symptoms such as: chest pain, trouble breathing, sudden numbness or weakness, a cold or pale arm or leg, confusion, or problems with speech or balance.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Mircera if you are allergic to epoetin beta or methoxy polyethylene glycol, or if you have:</p><ul>

Comments:<br/>
-Use is neither indicated or recommended for anemia from cancer chemotherapy.<br/>
-Use is neither indicated or recommended as a substitute for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions when immediate correction of anemia is required.<br/>
-Improvements in symptoms, physical function, or health related quality of life have not been shown.<br/>
-Initiate therapy when hemoglobin is under 10 g/dL, the rate of hemoglobin decline is likely to require a RBC infusion, and reducing RBC transfusion related risks, including alloimmunization, is a goal.<br/>
-If hemoglobin exceeds 10 g/dL, reduce or interrupt dose.<br/>
-Use the lowest dose necessary to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using Mircera?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Mircera side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Mircera</b> (hives, itching, sweating, wheezing, difficult breathing, dizziness, swelling in your face or throat, fainting) <b>or a severe skin reaction</b> (fever, sore throat, burning eyes, skin pain, red or purple skin rash with blistering and peeling).</p><p><b>This medicine can increase your risk of serious or fatal side effects.</b> Call your doctor or get emergency medical help if you have:</p><ul>
