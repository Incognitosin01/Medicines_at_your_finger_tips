</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Smoking Cessation Agent</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Cholinergic</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for nicotine</h2><p>Nicotine oral chewing gum and lozenges are used to help you stop smoking. Nicotine is absorbed from the gum or lozenge in the mouth and enters the blood stream. This replaces the nicotine you would get from smoking and makes the withdrawal effects from not smoking less severe. The amount of nicotine is decreased over time until use is stopped.</p><p>Nicotine is available without a prescription, but proof of age (18 years or older) is required.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using nicotine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For nicotine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to nicotine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of oral nicotine in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established. Small amounts of nicotine can cause serious unwanted effects in children, and lozenges or gum contain enough nicotine to cause problems, including used pieces.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of oral nicotine in geriatric patients.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of nicotine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Diabetes or</li>
<li>Heart or blood vessel disease or</li>
<li>Hypertension (high blood pressure), uncontrolled or</li>
<li>Irritation of mouth or throat or</li>
<li>Loose dental fillings (gum only) or</li>
<li>Stomach ulcer—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Phenylketonuria (metabolic disorder)—Some of the lozenges contain phenylalanine, which may make this condition worse.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of nicotine</h2><p>Use nicotine exactly as directed in the dosing section on the label. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>Nicotine comes with a patient instruction booklet. Read and follow these instructions carefully.</p><p>It is also important to use a stop-smoking program that may include education, counseling, and psychological support. This may make it easier for you to stop smoking.</p><p>Begin using nicotine on your "quit" day, even if you are not able to stop smoking immediately.</p><p><i>Chewing gum</i>:</p><ul>
<li>If you have the urge to smoke, slowly chew one piece of gum until you notice a peppery taste or feel a slight tingling in your mouth.</li>
<li>Stop chewing and place (“park”) the gum between your cheek and gum. When the taste or tingling is almost gone, slowly chew the gum again until you taste it.</li>
<li>Continue chewing and “parking” the gum for about 30 minutes to get the full dose.</li>
<li>Do not chew too fast or chew more than one piece at a time.</li>
<li>Do not drink acidic beverages, such as citrus fruit juices, coffee, soft drinks, or tea within 15 minutes before or while chewing a piece of gum.</li>
<li>As your urge to smoke becomes less frequent, gradually reduce the pieces of gum used. Follow the dosing instructions on the label.</li>
</ul><p><i>Lozenges</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Do not eat or drink for 15 minutes before using a lozenge.</li>
<li>If you have the urge to smoke, slowly suck one lozenge until it dissolves.</li>
<li>Do not bite or chew the lozenge like hard candy. Do not swallow the lozenge. Try not to swallow most of the dissolved medicine.</li>
<li>Do not use more than one lozenge at a time or many lozenges one after another.</li>
<li>As your urge to smoke becomes less frequent, gradually reduce the number of lozenges used. Follow the dosing instructions on the label.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of nicotine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of nicotine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
