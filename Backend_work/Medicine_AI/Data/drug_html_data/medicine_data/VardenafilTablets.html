</ul><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><h3>General Dose Information</h3><p class="First">For most patients, the recommended starting dose of vardenafil hydrochloride tablet is 10 mg, taken orally, as needed, approximately 60 minutes before sexual activity. The dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 20 mg or decreased to 5 mg based on efficacy and side effects. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day. Sexual stimulation is required for a response to treatment.</p><h3>Use with Food</h3><p class="First">Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets can be taken with or without food.</p><h3>Use in Specific Populations</h3><p class="First">Geriatrics: A starting dose of 5 mg vardenafil hydrochloride tablets should be considered in patients ≥65 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment:</span> For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B), a starting dose of 5 mg vardenafil hydrochloride tablet is recommended. The maximum dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment should not exceed 10 mg.</p><p>Do not use vardenafil hydrochloride tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment:</span> Do not use vardenafil hydrochloride tablets in patients on renal dialysis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Concomitant Medications</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nitrates:</span> Concomitant use with nitrates and nitric oxide donors in any form is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators, such as riociguat</span>: Concomitant use is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.2)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">CYP3A4 Inhibitors:</span> The dosage of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets may require adjustment in patients receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, atazanavir, and clarithromycin as well as in other patients receiving moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)].</span> For ritonavir, a single dose of 2.5 mg vardenafil hydrochloride tablets should not be exceeded in a 72-hour period. For indinavir, saquinavir, atazanavir, ketoconazole 400 mg daily, itraconazole 400 mg daily, and clarithromycin, a single dose of 2.5 mg vardenafil hydrochloride tablets should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period. For ketoconazole 200 mg daily, itraconazole 200 mg daily, and erythromycin, a single dose of 5 mg vardenafil hydrochloride tablets should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period.</p><p><span class="Bold">Alpha-Blockers:</span> In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended starting dose. Concomitant treatment should be initiated only if the patient is stable on his alpha-blocker therapy. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure in patients taking a phosphodiesterase (PDE5) inhibitor including vardenafil. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, vardenafil hydrochloride tablets should be initiated at a dose of 5 mg (2.5 mg when used concomitantly with certain CYP3A4 inhibitors) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span> <span class="Italics">and</span><span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><p>A time interval between dosing should be considered when vardenafil hydrochloride tablet is prescribed concomitantly with alpha-blocker therapy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First">Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets 2.5 mg are light orange to orange, film-coated round tablets debossed with “L” on one side and “04” on other side.</p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg are light orange to orange, film-coated round tablets debossed with “L” on one side and “05” on other side.</p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets 10 mg are light orange to orange, film-coated round tablets debossed with ‘480’ on one side and plain on the other side.</p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets 20 mg are light orange to orange, film-coated round tablets debossed with ‘481’ on one side and plain on the other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Nitrates</h3><p class="First">Administration of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets with nitrates (either regularly and/or intermittently) and nitric oxide donors is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. Consistent with the effects of PDE5 inhibition on the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway, PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride tablets, may potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates. A suitable time interval following dosing of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets for the safe administration of nitrates or nitric oxide donors has not been determined.</p><h3>Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators</h3><p class="First">Do not use vardenafil hydrochloride tablets in patients who are using a GC stimulator, such as riociguat. PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride tablets may potentiate the hypotensive effects of GC stimulators.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><p class="First">The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a medical assessment, a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment.</p><p>Before prescribing vardenafil hydrochloride, it is important to note the following:</p><h3>Cardiovascular Effects</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">General</span></p><p>Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatment for erectile dysfunction, including vardenafil hydrochloride, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is not recommended because of their underlying cardiovascular status.</p><p>There are no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of vardenafil in the following patients; and therefore its use is not recommended until further information is available: unstable angina; hypotension (resting systolic blood pressure of &lt;90 mmHg); uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;170/110 mmHg); recent history of stroke, life-threatening arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction (within the last 6 months); severe cardiac failure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Left Ventricular Outflow Obstruction</span></p><p>Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (for example, aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators including PDE5 inhibitors.</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood Pressure Effects</span></p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 7 mmHg systolic and 8 mmHg diastolic) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing vardenafil hydrochloride, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects.</p><h3>Potential for Drug Interactions with Potent or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, indinavir, ketoconazole) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as erythromycin) increases plasma concentrations of vardenafil. Dosage adjustment is necessary when vardenafil hydrochloride is administered with certain CYP3A4 inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Interactions (7.2)].</span></p><p>Long-term safety information is not available on the concomitant administration of vardenafil with HIV protease inhibitors.</p><h3>Risk of Priapism</h3><p class="First">There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds, including vardenafil. In the event that an erection persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may result.</p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride should be used with caution by patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie’s disease) or by patients who have conditions that may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia).</p><h3>Effects on the Eye</h3><p class="First">Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride, and seek medical attention in the event of sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non­arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a rare condition and a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision, that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. Based on published literature, the annual incidence of NAION is 2.5 to 11.8 cases per 100,000 in males aged ≥50.<br/>
An observational case-crossover study evaluated the risk of NAION when PDE5 inhibitor use, as a class, occurred immediately before NAION onset (within 5 half-lives), compared to PDE5 inhibitor use in a prior time period. The results suggest an approximate 2-fold increase in the risk of NAION, with a risk estimate of 2.15 (95% CI 1.06, 4.34). A similar study reported a consistent result, with a risk estimate of 2.27 (95% CI 0.99, 5.2). Other risk factors for NAION, such as the presence of “crowded” optic disc, may have contributed to the occurrence of NAION in these studies.<br/>
Neither the rare postmarketing reports, nor the association of PDE5 inhibitor use and NAION in the observational studies, substantiate a causal relationship between PDE5 inhibitor use and NAION <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p>Physicians should consider whether their patients with underlying NAION risk factors could be adversely affected by use of PDE5 inhibitors. Individuals who have already experienced NAION are at increased risk of NAION recurrence. Therefore, PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride, should be used with caution in these patients and only when the anticipated benefits outweigh the risks. Individuals with “crowded” optic disc are also considered at greater risk for NAION compared to the general population, however, evidence is insufficient to support screening of prospective users of PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride, for this uncommon condition.</p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride has not been evaluated in patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, therefore its use is not recommended until further information is available in those patients.</p><h3>Sudden Hearing Loss</h3><p class="First">Physicians should advise patients to stop taking all PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Alpha-Blockers</h3><p class="First">Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (for example, fainting) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. Consideration should be given to the following:</p><p>  ·            Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.</p><p>  ·            In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended starting dose <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><p>  ·            In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure in patients taking a PDE5 inhibitor.</p><p>  ·            Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs.</p><h3>Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">In a study of the effect of vardenafil hydrochloride on QT interval in 59 healthy males <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>, therapeutic (10 mg) and supratherapeutic (80 mg) doses of vardenafil and the active control moxifloxacin (400 mg) produced similar increases in QTc interval. A postmarketing study evaluating the effect of combining vardenafil hydrochloride with another drug of comparable QT effect showed an additive QT effect when compared with either drug alone <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions when prescribing vardenafil hydrochloride to patients with known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval.</p><p>Patients taking Class 1A (for example. quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (for example, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications or those with congenital QT prolongation, should avoid using vardenafil hydrochloride.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Do not use vardenafil hydrochloride in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Do not use vardenafil hydrochloride in patients on renal dialysis, as vardenafil has not been evaluated in this population <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].</span></p><h3>Combination with Other Erectile Dysfunction Therapies</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of vardenafil hydrochloride used in combination with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended.</p><h3>Effects on Bleeding</h3><p class="First">In humans, vardenafil alone in doses up to 20 mg does not prolong the bleeding time. There is no clinical evidence of any additive prolongation of the bleeding time when vardenafil is administered with aspirin. Vardenafil hydrochloride has not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Therefore vardenafil hydrochloride should be administered to these patients after careful benefit-risk assessment.</p><h3>Sexually Transmitted Disease</h3><p class="First">The use of vardenafil hydrochloride offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling of patients about protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), should be considered.</p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets contain FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions with the use of vardenafil hydrochloride are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><p>  ·            Cardiovascular Effects <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></p><p>  ·            Priapism <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></p><p>  ·            Effects on Eye <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></p><p>  ·            Sudden Hearing Loss <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span></p><p>  ·            QT Prolongation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span></p><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride was administered to over 4430 men (mean age 56, range 18 to 89 years; 81% White, 6% Black, 2% Asian, 2% Hispanic and 9% Other) during controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials worldwide. Over 2200 patients were treated for 6 months or longer and 880 patients were treated for at least 1 year.</p><p>In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the discontinuation rate due to adverse events was 3.4% for vardenafil hydrochloride compared to 1.1% for placebo.</p><p>When vardenafil hydrochloride was taken as recommended in placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 1).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported By ≥2% of Patients Treated with Vardenafil Hydrochloride and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in Fixed and Flexible<span class="Sup">a</span> Dose Randomized, Controlled Trials of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg Vardenafil</span></p><p>a)       Flexible dose studies started all patients at vardenafil hydrochloride 10 mg and allowed decrease in dose to 5 mg or increase in dose to 20 mg based on side effects and efficacy.</p><p>b)       All the events listed in the above table were deemed to be adverse drug reactions with the exception of accidental injury.</p><p>Back pain was reported in 2% of patients treated with vardenafil hydrochloride and 1.7% of patients on placebo.</p><p>Placebo-controlled trials suggested a dose effect in the incidence of some adverse reactions (headache, flushing, dyspepsia, nausea, and rhinitis) over the 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg doses of vardenafil hydrochloride.</p><p><span class="Bold">All Vardenafil Studies:</span> Vardenafil hydrochloride film-coated tablets and vardenafil orally disintegrating tablets have been administered to over 17,000 men (mean age 54.5, range 18 to 89 years; 70% White, 5% Black, 13% Asian, 4% Hispanic and 8% Other) during controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials worldwide. The number of patients treated for 6 months or longer was 3357, and 1350 patients were treated for at least 1 year.</p><p>In the placebo-controlled clinical trials for vardenafil hydrochloride film-coated tablets and vardenafil orally disintegrating tablets, the discontinuation rate due to adverse events was 1.9% for vardenafil compared to 0.8% for placebo.</p><p>The following section identifies additional, less frequent adverse reactions (&lt;2%) reported during the clinical development of vardenafil hydrochloride film-coated tablets and vardenafil orally disintegrating tablets. Excluded from this list are those adverse reactions that are infrequent and minor, those events that may be commonly observed in the absence of drug therapy, and those events that are not reasonably associated with the drug:</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a whole:</span> allergic edema and angioedema, feeling unwell, allergic reactions, chest pain</p><p><span class="Italics">Auditory:</span> tinnitus, vertigo</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> palpitation, tachycardia, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, hypotension</p><p><span class="Italics">Digestive:</span> nausea, gastrointestinal and abdominal pain, dry mouth, diarrhea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, vomiting, increase in transaminases</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> increase in creatine phosphokinase (CPK), increased muscle tone and cramping, myalgia</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous:</span> paresthesia and dysesthesia, somnolence, sleep disorder, syncope, amnesia, seizure</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory:</span> dyspnea, sinus congestion</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and appendages:</span> erythema, rash</p><p><span class="Italics">Ophthalmologic:</span> visual disturbance, ocular hyperemia, visual color distortions, eye pain and eye discomfort, photophobia, increase in intraocular pressure, conjunctivitis</p><p><span class="Italics">Urogenital:</span> increase in erection, priapism</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of vardenafil hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Ophthalmologic:</span> Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio (“crowded disc”), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia and smoking <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17.7)]</span>.</p><p>Visual disturbances including vision loss (temporary or permanent), such as visual field defect, retinal vein occlusion, and reduced visual acuity, have also been reported rarely in postmarketing experience. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of vardenafil.</p><p><span class="Italics">Neurologic:</span> Seizure, seizure recurrence and transient global amnesia have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with vardenafil.</p><p><span class="Italics">Otologic:</span> Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil. In some cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of vardenafil, to the patient’s underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17.8)]</span>.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with Vardenafil Hydrochloride</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nitrates:</span> Concomitant use of vardenafil hydrochloride and nitrates and nitric oxide donors is contraindicated. The blood pressure lowering effects of sublingual nitrates (0.4 mg) taken 1 and 4 hours after vardenafil and increases in heart rate when taken at 1, 4 and 8 hours after vardenafil were potentiated by a 20 mg dose of vardenafil hydrochloride in healthy middle-aged subjects. These effects were not observed when vardenafil hydrochloride 20 mg was taken 24 hours before the nitroglycerin (NTG). Potentiation of the hypotensive effects of nitrates for patients with ischemic heart disease has not been evaluated, and concomitant use of vardenafil hydrochloride and nitrates is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Alpha-Blockers:</span> Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with co-administration of vardenafil with alfuzosin, terazosin or tamsulosin <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Antihypertensives:</span> Vardenafil hydrochloride may add to the blood pressure lowering effects of antihypertensive agents. In a clinical pharmacology study of patients with erectile dysfunction, single doses of vardenafil 20 mg caused a mean maximum decrease in supine blood pressure of 7 mmHg systolic and 8 mmHg diastolic (compared to placebo), accompanied by a mean maximum increase of heart rate of 4 beats per minute. The maximum decrease in blood pressure occurred between 1 and 4 hours after dosing. Following multiple dosing for 31 days, similar blood pressure responses were observed on Day 31 as on Day 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Alcohol:</span> Vardenafil hydrochloride (20 mg) did not potentiate the hypotensive effects of alcohol during the 4-hour observation period in healthy volunteers when administered with alcohol (0.5 g/kg body weight, approximately 40 mL of absolute alcohol in a 70 kg person). Alcohol and vardenafil plasma levels were not altered when dosed simultaneously.</p><h3>Effect of Other Drugs on Vardenafil</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro studies</span></p><p>Studies in human liver microsomes showed that vardenafil is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4/5, and to a lesser degree by CYP2C9. Therefore, inhibitors of these enzymes are expected to reduce vardenafil clearance <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vivo studies</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors</span></p><p>Ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) produced a 10-fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 4-fold increase in maximum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) when co-administered with vardenafil hydrochloride (5 mg) in healthy volunteers. A 5-mg vardenafil hydrochloride dose should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period when used in combination with 200 mg once daily ketoconazole. Since higher doses of ketoconazole (400 mg daily) may result in higher increases in Cmax and AUC, a single 2.5 mg dose of vardenafil hydrochloride should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period when used in combination with ketoconazole 400 mg daily <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5)].</span></p><p>Indinavir (800 mg t.i.d.) co-administered with vardenafil hydrochloride 10 mg resulted in a 16-fold increase in vardenafil AUC, a 7-fold increase in vardenafil C<span class="Sub">max</span> and a 2-fold increase in vardenafil half-life. It is recommended not to exceed a single 2.5 mg vardenafil hydrochloride dose in a 24-hour period when used in combination with indinavir <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><p>Ritonavir (600 mg b.i.d.) co-administered with vardenafil hydrochloride 5 mg resulted in a 49-fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 13­ fold increase in vardenafil C<span class="Sub">max</span>. The interaction is a consequence of blocking hepatic metabolism of vardenafil by ritonavir, a HIV protease inhibitor and a highly potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, which also inhibits CYP2C9. Ritonavir significantly prolonged the half-life of vardenafil to 26 hours. Consequently, it is recommended not to exceed a single 2.5 mg vardenafil hydrochloride dose in a 72-hour period when used in combination with ritonavir <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors</span></p><p>Erythromycin (500 mg t.i.d.) produced a 4-fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 3-fold increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> when co- administered with vardenafil hydrochloride 5 mg in healthy volunteers. It is recommended not to exceed a single 5 mg dose of vardenafil hydrochloride in a 24-hour period when used in combination with erythromycin <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5)].</span></p><p>Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inhibitors, including grapefruit juice would likely increase vardenafil exposure.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Italics">Other Drug Interactions</span></p><p>No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between vardenafil and the following drugs: glyburide, warfarin, digoxin, an antacid based on magnesium-aluminum hydroxide, and ranitidine. In the warfarin study, vardenafil had no effect on the prothrombin time or other pharmacodynamic parameters.</p><p>Cimetidine (400 mg b.i.d.) had no effect on vardenafil bioavailability (AUC) and maximum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of vardenafil when co-administered with 20 mg vardenafil hydrochloride in healthy volunteers.</p><h3>Effects of Vardenafil on Other Drugs</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro studies</span></p><p>Vardenafil and its metabolites had no effect on CYP1A2, 2A6, and 2E1 (Ki &gt;100 micromolar). Weak inhibitory effects toward other isoforms (CYP2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4) were found, but Ki values were in excess of plasma concentrations achieved following dosing.

There are no studies of vardenafil hydrochloride use in pregnant women.</p><p>No evidence of specific potential for teratogenicity, embryotoxicity or fetotoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits that received vardenafil at up to 18 mg/kg/day during organogenesis. This dose is approximately 100 fold (rat) and 29 fold (rabbit) greater than the AUC values for unbound vardenafil and its major metabolite in humans given the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg.</p><p>In the rat pre-and postnatal development study, the NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) for maternal toxicity was 8 mg/kg/day. Retarded physical development of pups in the absence of maternal effects was observed following maternal exposure to 1 and 8 mg/kg possibly due to vasodilatation and/or secretion of the drug into milk. The number of living pups born to rats exposed pre- and postnatally was reduced at 60 mg/kg/day. Based on the results of the pre- and postnatal study, the developmental NOAEL is less than 1 mg/kg/day. Based on plasma exposures in the rat developmental toxicity study, 1 mg/kg/day in the pregnant rat is estimated to produce total AUC values for unbound vardenafil and its major metabolite comparable to the human AUC at the MRHD of 20 mg.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Vardenafil hydrochloride is not indicated for use in women.

Following a single oral dose of 3 mg/kg, 3.3% of the administered dose was excreted into the milk within 24 hours.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Vardenafil hydrochloride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Elderly males 65 years of age and older have higher vardenafil plasma concentrations than younger males (18 to 45 years), mean Cmax and AUC were 34% and 52% higher, respectively. Phase 3 clinical trials included more than 834 elderly patients, and no differences in safety or effectiveness of vardenafil hydrochloride 5, 10, or 20 mg were noted when these elderly patients were compared to younger patients. However, due to increased vardenafil concentrations in the elderly, a starting dose of 5 mg vardenafil hydrochloride should be considered in patients ≥65 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.</p><p>Do not use vardenafil hydrochloride in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).

The majority of these subjects experienced reversible back pain/myalgia and/or “abnormal vision.” Single doses up to 80 mg vardenafil and multiple doses up to 40 mg vardenafil administered once daily over 4 weeks were tolerated without producing serious adverse side effects.</p><p>When 40 mg of vardenafil was administered twice daily, cases of severe back pain were observed. No muscle or neurological toxicity was identified.</p><p>In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be taken as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as vardenafil is highly bound to plasma proteins and not significantly eliminated in the urine.</p><h2>Vardenafil Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets are administered orally for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. This monohydrochloride salt of vardenafil is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5).</p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride is designated chemically as piperazine, 1-[[3-(1,4-dihydro-5-methyl-4-oxo-7-propylimidazo[5,1-<span class="Italics">f</span>][1,2,4]triazin-2-yl)-4-ethoxyphenyl]sulfonyl]-4-ethyl-, monohydrochloride and has the following structural formula:</p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride is a white or slightly brown or yellow powder with a molecular weight of 579.11. It is slightly soluble in water, freely soluble in anhydrous ethanol. Practically insoluble in heptane.</p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride is available as film-coated tablets for oral administration, containing 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg of vardenafil. The inactive ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, crospovidone, talc, colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate. The colorants include hypromellose, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol 6000, iron oxide yellow, iron oxide red, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 Tartrazine Aluminum Lake and FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6 Sunset Yellow FCF Aluminum Lake.</p><h2>Vardenafil Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Penile erection is a hemodynamic process initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP in turn triggers smooth muscle relaxation, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in erection. The tissue concentration of cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5); therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Because sexual stimulation is required to initiate the local release of nitric oxide, the inhibition of PDE5 has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that vardenafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. The inhibitory effect of vardenafil is more selective on PDE5 than for other known phosphodiesterases (&gt;15-fold relative to PDE6, &gt;130-fold relative to PDE1, &gt;300-fold relative to PDE11, and &gt;1,000-fold relative to PDE2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10).</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Effects on Blood Pressure</span></p><p>In a clinical pharmacology study of patients with erectile dysfunction, single doses of vardenafil 20 mg caused a mean maximum decrease in supine blood pressure of 7 mmHg systolic and 8 mmHg diastolic (compared to placebo), accompanied by a mean maximum increase of heart rate of 4 beats per minute. The maximum decrease in blood pressure occurred between 1 and 4 hours after dosing. Following multiple dosing for 31 days, similar blood pressure responses were observed on Day 31 as on Day 1.

The blood pressure effects were observed when vardenafil hydrochloride 20 mg was dosed 1 or 4 hours before NTG and the heart rate effects were observed when 20 mg was dosed 1, 4, or 8 hours before NTG.

In a corresponding 1-month rat toxicity study, this dose produced an AUC value for unbound vardenafil 200 fold greater than AUC in humans at the MRHD of 20 mg.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Vardenafil hydrochloride was evaluated in four major double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, parallel design, multicenter trials in 2431 men aged 20 to 83 (mean age 57 years; 78% White, 7% Black, 2% Asian, 3% Hispanic and 10% Other/Unknown). The doses of vardenafil hydrochloride in these studies were 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg. Two of these trials were conducted in the general erectile dysfunction (ED) population and two in special ED populations (one in patients with diabetes mellitus and one in post-prostatectomy patients). Vardenafil hydrochloride was dosed without regard to meals on an as needed basis in men with ED, many of whom had multiple other medical conditions. The primary endpoints were assessed at 3 months.</p><p>Primary efficacy assessment in all four major trials was by means of the Erectile Function (EF) Domain score of the validated International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Questionnaire and two questions from the Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) dealing with the ability to achieve vaginal penetration (SEP2), and the ability to maintain an erection long enough for successful intercourse (SEP3).</p><p>In all four fixed-dose efficacy trials, vardenafil hydrochloride showed clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in the EF Domain, SEP2, and SEP3 scores compared to placebo. The mean baseline EF Domain score in these trials was 11.8 (scores range from 0 to 30 where lower scores represent more severe disease). Vardenafil hydrochloride (5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg) was effective in all age categories (&lt;45, 45 to &lt;65, and ≥65 years) and was also effective regardless of race (White, Black, Other).</p><h3>Trials in a General Erectile Dysfunction Population</h3><p class="First">In the major North American fixed-dose trial, 762 patients (mean age 57, range 20 to 83 years; 79% White, 13% Black, 4% Hispanic, 2% Asian and 2% Other) were evaluated. The mean baseline EF Domain scores were 13, 13, 13, 14 for the vardenafil hydrochloride 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and placebo groups, respectively. There was significant improvement (p&lt;0.0001) at 3 months with vardenafil hydrochloride (EF Domain scores of 18, 21, 21, for the 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg dose groups, respectively) compared to the placebo group (EF Domain score of 15). The European trial (total N=803) confirmed these results. The improvement in mean score was maintained at all doses at 6 months in the North American trial.</p><p>In the North American trial, vardenafil hydrochloride significantly improved the rates of achieving an erection sufficient for penetration (SEP2) at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg compared to placebo (65%, 75%, and 80%, respectively, compared to a 52% response in the placebo group at 3 months; p &lt;0.0001). The European trial confirmed these results.</p><p>Vardenafil hydrochloride demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant increase in the overall per-patient rate of maintenance of erection to successful intercourse (SEP3) (51% on 5 mg, 64% on 10 mg, and 65% on 20 mg, respectively, compared to 32% on placebo; p &lt;0.0001) at 3 months in the North American trial.
