It is recommended that Sirolimus Oral Solution be taken 4 hours after administration of cyclosporine oral solution (MODIFIED) and/or cyclosporine capsules (MODIFIED) [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.2)</span>].</p><p>Frequent Sirolimus Oral Solution dose adjustments based on non-steady-state sirolimus concentrations can lead to overdosing or underdosing because sirolimus has a long half-life. Once Sirolimus Oral Solution maintenance dose is adjusted, patients should continue on the new maintenance dose for at least 7 to 14 days before further dosage adjustment with concentration monitoring. In most patients, dose adjustments can be based on simple proportion: new Sirolimus Oral Solution dose = current dose x (target concentration/current concentration). A loading dose should be considered in addition to a new maintenance dose when it is necessary to increase sirolimus trough concentrations: Sirolimus Oral Solution loading dose = 3 x (new maintenance dose - current maintenance dose). The maximum Sirolimus Oral Solution dose administered on any day should not exceed 40 mg. If an estimated daily dose exceeds 40 mg due to the addition of a loading dose, the loading dose should be administered over 2 days. Sirolimus trough concentrations should be monitored at least 3 to 4 days after a loading dose(s).</p><p>Two milligrams (2 mg) of Sirolimus Oral Solution have been demonstrated to be clinically equivalent to 2 mg sirolimus tablets; hence, at this dose these two formulations are interchangeable. However, it is not known if higher doses of Sirolimus Oral Solution are clinically equivalent to higher doses of sirolimus tablets on a mg-to-mg basis [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Transplant Patients at Low- to Moderate-Immunologic Risk</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Sirolimus Oral Solution and Cyclosporine Combination Therapy</span></p><p>For <span class="Italics">de novo</span> renal transplant patients, it is recommended that Sirolimus Oral Solution  be used initially in a regimen with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. A loading dose of Sirolimus Oral Solution equivalent to 3 times the maintenance dose should be given, i.e. a daily maintenance dose of 2 mg should be preceded with a loading dose of 6 mg. Therapeutic drug monitoring should be used to maintain sirolimus drug concentrations within the target-range [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.5)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Sirolimus Oral Solution Following Cyclosporine Withdrawal</span></p><p>At 2 to 4 months following transplantation, cyclosporine should be progressively discontinued over 4 to 8 weeks, and the Sirolimus Oral Solution dose should be adjusted to obtain sirolimus whole blood trough concentrations within the target-range [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.5)</span>]. Because cyclosporine inhibits the metabolism and transport of sirolimus, sirolimus concentrations may decrease when cyclosporine is discontinued, unless the Sirolimus Oral Solution dose is increased [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Transplant Patients at High-Immunologic Risk</h3><p class="First">In patients with high-immunologic risk, it is recommended that Sirolimus Oral Solution be used in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for the first 12 months following transplantation [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14.3)</span>]. The safety and efficacy of this combination in high-immunologic risk patients has not been studied beyond the first 12 months. Therefore, after the first 12 months following transplantation, any adjustments to the immunosuppressive regimen should be considered on the basis of the clinical status of the patient.</p><p>For patients receiving Sirolimus Oral Solution with cyclosporine, Sirolimus Oral Solution therapy should be initiated with a loading dose of up to 15 mg on day 1 post-transplantation. Beginning on day 2, an initial maintenance dose of 5 mg/day should be given. A trough level should be obtained between days 5 and 7, and the daily dose of Sirolimus Oral Solution should thereafter be adjusted [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.5)</span>].</p><p>The starting dose of cyclosporine should be up to 7 mg/kg/day in divided doses and the dose should subsequently be adjusted to achieve target whole blood trough concentrations [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.5)</span>]. Prednisone should be administered at a minimum of 5 mg/day.</p><p>Antibody induction therapy may be used.</p><h3>Therapeutic Drug Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Monitoring of sirolimus trough concentrations is recommended for all patients, especially in those patients likely to have altered drug metabolism, in patients ≥ 13 years who weigh less than 40 kg, in patients with hepatic impairment, when a change in the Sirolimus Oral Solution dosage form is made, and during concurrent administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>Therapeutic drug monitoring should not be the sole basis for adjusting Sirolimus Oral Solution therapy. Careful attention should be made to clinical signs/symptoms, tissue biopsy findings, and laboratory parameters.</p><p>When used in combination with cyclosporine, sirolimus trough concentrations should be maintained within the target-range [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. Following cyclosporine withdrawal in transplant patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, the target sirolimus trough concentrations should be 16 ng/mL to 24 ng/mL for the first year following transplantation. Thereafter, the target sirolimus concentrations should be 12 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL.</p><p>The above recommended 24-hour trough concentration ranges for sirolimus are based on chromatographic methods. Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by both chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Because the measured sirolimus whole blood concentrations depend on the type of assay used, the concentrations obtained by these different methodologies are not interchangeable [<span class="Italics">see <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.17)</span></span></span>, <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span></span>]. Adjustments to the targeted range should be made according to the assay utilized to determine sirolimus trough concentrations. Since results are assay and laboratory dependent, and the results may change over time, adjustments to the targeted therapeutic range must be made with a detailed knowledge of the site-specific assay used. Therefore, communication should be maintained with the laboratory performing the assay. A discussion of different assay methods is contained in Clinical Therapeutics, Volume 22, Supplement B, April 2000 [<span class="Italics">see References (15)</span>].</p><h3>Patients with Low Body Weight</h3><p class="First">The initial dosage in patients ≥ 13 years who weigh less than 40 kg should be adjusted, based on body surface area, to 1 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. The loading dose should be 3 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.</p><h3>Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">It is recommended that the maintenance dose of Sirolimus Oral Solution be reduced by approximately one third in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and by approximately one half in patients with severe hepatic impairment. It is not necessary to modify the Sirolimus Oral Solution loading dose [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.6),</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span></span>].</p><h3>Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dosage adjustment is not needed in patients with impaired renal function [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)</span>].</p><h3>Instructions for Dilution and Administration of Sirolimus Oral Solution</h3><p class="First">The amber oral dose syringe should be used to withdraw the prescribed amount of Sirolimus Oral Solution from the bottle. Empty the correct amount of Sirolimus Oral Solution from the syringe into only a glass or plastic container holding at least two (2) ounces (1/4 cup, 60 mL) of water or orange juice. No other liquids, including grapefruit juice, should be used for dilution [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. Stir vigorously and drink at once. Refill the container with an additional volume [minimum of four (4) ounces (1/2 cup, 120 mL)] of water or orange juice, stir vigorously, and drink at once.</p><p>Sirolimus Oral Solution contains polysorbate 80, which is known to increase the rate of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride (PVC). This should be considered during the preparation and administration of Sirolimus Oral Solution. It is important that these recommendations be followed closely.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><h3>Sirolimus Oral Solution</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>60 mg per 60 mL in amber glass bottle.</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Sirolimus Oral Solution is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to sirolimus [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>].</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Increased Susceptibility to Infection and the Possible Development of Lymphoma</h3><p class="First">Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may result from immunosuppression. The rates of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease observed in Studies 1 and 2 were 0.7% to 3.2% (for sirolimus-treated patients) versus 0.6% to 0.8% (azathioprine and placebo control) [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1) </span>and <span class="Italics">(6.2)</span>]. Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, and sepsis. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use sirolimus for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient.</p><h3>Liver Transplantation – Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. The use of sirolimus has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients following liver transplantation, including excess mortality, graft loss and hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT).</p><p>In a study in <span class="Italics">de novo</span> liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss (22% in combination versus 9% on tacrolimus alone). Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death.</p><p>In this and another study in <span class="Italics">de novo</span> liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT (7% in combination versus 2% in the control arm); most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post-transplantation, and most led to graft loss or death.</p><p>In a clinical study in stable liver transplant patients 6 to 144 months post-liver transplantation and receiving a CNI-based regimen, an increased number of deaths was observed in the group converted to a sirolimus-based regimen compared to the group who was continued on a CNI-based regimen, although the difference was not statistically significant (3.8% versus 1.4%) [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14.5)</span>].</p><h3>Lung Transplantation – Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence</h3><p class="First">Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in <span class="Italics">de novo</span> lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen.</p><p>The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in lung transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the administration of sirolimus [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.7)</span>].</p><h3>Angioedema</h3><p class="First">Sirolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of sirolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. Elevated sirolimus levels (with/without concomitant ACE inhibitors) may also potentiate angioedema [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.2)</span>]. In some cases, the angioedema has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus.</p><h3>Fluid Accumulation and Impairment of Wound Healing</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving sirolimus, including lymphocele and wound dehiscence [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>]. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability. Lymphocele, a known surgical complication of renal transplantation, occurred significantly more often in a dose-related fashion in patients treated with sirolimus [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>]. Appropriate measures should be considered to minimize such complications. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature.</p><p>There have also been reports of fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema, lymphedema, pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusions (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults), in patients receiving sirolimus.</p><h3>Hyperlipidemia</h3><p class="First">Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with sirolimus compared with azathioprine or placebo controls in Studies 1 and 2 [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>]. There were increased incidences of hypercholesterolemia (43% to 46%) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (45% to 57%) in patients receiving sirolimus compared with placebo controls (each 23%). The risk/benefit should be carefully considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including sirolimus.</p><p>Any patient who is administered sirolimus should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines.</p><p>In clinical trials of patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine or sirolimus after cyclosporine withdrawal, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels &gt;240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels. The concomitant administration of sirolimus and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors resulted in adverse reactions such as CPK elevations (3%), myalgia (6.7%) and rhabdomyolysis (&lt;1%). In these trials, the number of patients was too small and duration of follow-up too short to evaluate the long-term impact of sirolimus on cardiovascular mortality.</p><p>During sirolimus therapy with or without cyclosporine, patients should be monitored for elevated lipids, and patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents.</p><h3>Decline in Renal Function</h3><p class="First">Renal function should be closely monitored during the co-administration of sirolimus with cyclosporine, because long-term administration of the combination has been associated with deterioration of renal function. Patients treated with cyclosporine and sirolimus were noted to have higher serum creatinine levels and lower glomerular filtration rates compared with patients treated with cyclosporine and placebo or azathioprine controls (Studies 1 and 2). The rate of decline in renal function in these studies was greater in patients receiving sirolimus and cyclosporine compared with control therapies.</p><p>Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen, including discontinuation of sirolimus and/or cyclosporine, should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, continuation of combination therapy with cyclosporine beyond 4 months following transplantation should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks of this combination for the individual patients. Caution should be exercised when using agents (e.g., aminoglycosides and amphotericin B) that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function. In patients with delayed graft function, sirolimus may delay recovery of renal function.</p><h3>Proteinuria</h3><p class="First">Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended. In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients 6 to 120 months post-transplant, increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed from 6 through 24 months after conversion to sirolimus compared with CNI continuation [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14.4), Adverse Reactions (6.4)</span>]. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. New onset nephrosis (nephrotic syndrome) was also reported as a treatment-emergent adverse reaction in 2.2% of the sirolimus conversion group patients in comparison to 0.4% in the CNI continuation group of patients. Nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as urinary protein to creatinine ratio &gt; 3.5) was also reported in 9.2% in the sirolimus conversion group of patients in comparison to 3.7% in the CNI continuation group of patients. In some patients, reduction in the degree of urinary protein excretion was observed for individual patients following discontinuation of sirolimus. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established.</p><h3>Latent Viral Infections</h3><p class="First">Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including activation of latent viral infections. These include BK virus-associated nephropathy, which has been observed in renal transplant patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.7)</span>]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for BK virus-associated nephropathy. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of BK virus-associated nephropathy.</p><p>Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. PML commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. Consideration should be given to reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop PML. In transplant patients, physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the graft.</p><h3>Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis</h3><p class="First">Cases of interstitial lung disease [ILD] (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the ILD was reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH]) as a secondary event. In some cases, the ILD has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.7)</span>].</p><h3>De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of <span class="Italics">de novo</span> use of sirolimus without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients. In a multicenter clinical study, <span class="Italics">de novo</span> renal transplant patients treated with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids, and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and IL-2 receptor antagonist. A benefit, in terms of better renal function, was not apparent in the treatment arm with <span class="Italics">de novo</span> use of sirolimus without cyclosporine. These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/ Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Thrombotic Microangiopathy</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.7)</span>].</p><h3>Antimicrobial Prophylaxis</h3><p class="First">Cases of <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis carinii</span> pneumonia have been reported in transplant patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis carinii</span> pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation.</p><p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)</span>], sirolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, sirolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicity when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were equal to or less than human exposures at the recommended lowest starting dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use highly effective contraception while using sirolimus and for 12 weeks after ending treatment [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Male Infertility</h3><p class="First">Azoospermia or oligospermia may be observed [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span> Sirolimus is an anti-proliferative drug and affects rapidly dividing cells like the germ cells.</p><h3>Different Sirolimus Trough Concentrations Reported between Chromatographic and Immunoassay Methodologies</h3><p class="First">Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by various chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.5)</span>].</p><h3>Skin Cancer Events</h3><p class="First">Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer.

</ul><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and p-glycoprotein (P-gp). Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations whereas inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase sirolimus concentrations.</p><h3>Use with Cyclosporine</h3><p class="First">Cyclosporine, a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp, was demonstrated to increase sirolimus concentrations when co-administered with sirolimus. In order to diminish the effect of this interaction with cyclosporine, it is recommended that sirolimus be taken 4 hours after administration of cyclosporine oral solution (MODIFIED) and/or cyclosporine capsules (MODIFIED).

Sirolimus also inhibits antibody production. In cells, sirolimus binds to the immunophilin, FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to generate an immunosuppressive complex. The sirolimus:FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. This complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. This inhibition suppresses cytokine-driven T-cell proliferation, inhibiting the progression from the G<span class="Sub">1</span> to the S phase of the cell cycle. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability.</p><p>Studies in experimental models show that sirolimus prolongs allograft (kidney, heart, skin, islet, small bowel, pancreatico-duodenal, and bone marrow) survival in mice, rats, pigs, and/or primates. Sirolimus reverses acute rejection of heart and kidney allografts in rats and prolongs the graft survival in presensitized rats. In some studies, the immunosuppressive effect of sirolimus lasts up to 6 months after discontinuation of therapy. This tolerization effect is alloantigen-specific.</p><p>In rodent models of autoimmune disease, sirolimus suppresses immune-mediated events associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, collagen-induced arthritis, autoimmune type I diabetes, autoimmune myocarditis, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, graft-versus-host disease, and autoimmune uveoretinitis.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Orally-administered sirolimus, at doses of 2 mg/day and 5 mg/day, significantly reduced the incidence of organ rejection in low- to moderate-immunologic risk renal transplant patients at 6 months following transplantation compared with either azathioprine or placebo [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14.1)</span>]. There was no demonstrable efficacy advantage of a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg with a loading dose of 15 mg over a daily maintenance dose of 2 mg with a loading dose of 6 mg.

Study 3 was a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial conducted at 57 centers in Australia, Canada, and Europe. Five hundred twenty-five (525) patients were enrolled. All patients in this study received the tablet formulation. This study compared patients who were administered sirolimus, cyclosporine, and corticosteroids continuously with patients who received this same standardized therapy for the first 3 months after transplantation (pre-randomization period) followed by the withdrawal of cyclosporine. During cyclosporine withdrawal, the sirolimus dosages were adjusted to achieve targeted sirolimus whole blood trough concentration ranges (16 ng/mL to 24 ng/mL until month 12, then 12 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL thereafter, expressed as chromatographic assay values). At 3 months, 430 patients were equally randomized to either continue sirolimus with cyclosporine therapy or to receive sirolimus as a maintenance regimen following cyclosporine withdrawal.</p><p>Eligibility for randomization included no Banff Grade 3 acute rejection or vascular rejection episode in the 4 weeks before random assignment, serum creatinine ≤ 4.5 mg/dL, and adequate renal function to support cyclosporine withdrawal (in the opinion of the investigator). The primary efficacy endpoint was graft survival at 12 months after transplantation. Secondary efficacy endpoints were the rate of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection, patient survival, incidence of efficacy failure (defined as the first occurrence of either biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, or death), and treatment failure (defined as the first occurrence of either discontinuation, acute rejection, graft loss, or death).</p><p>The following table summarizes the resulting graft and patient survival at 12, 24, and 36 months for this trial.

Patients who had an acute rejection prior to randomization had a significantly higher GFR following cyclosporine withdrawal compared to those in the sirolimus with cyclosporine group. There was no significant difference in GFR between groups for patients who experienced acute rejection post-randomization.</p><p>Although the initial protocol was designed for 36 months, there was a subsequent amendment to extend this study. The results for the cyclosporine withdrawal group at months 48 and 60 were consistent with the results at month 36. Fifty-two percent (112/215) of the patients in the sirolimus with cyclosporine withdrawal group remained on therapy to month 60 and showed sustained GFR.</p><h3>High-Immunologic Risk Renal Transplant Patients</h3><p class="First">Sirolimus was studied in a one-year, clinical trial in high risk patients (Study 4) who were defined as Black transplant recipients and/or repeat renal transplant recipients who lost a previous allograft for immunologic reasons and/or patients with high panel-reactive antibodies (PRA; peak PRA level &gt; 80%). Patients received concentration-controlled sirolimus and cyclosporine (MODIFIED), and corticosteroids per local practice. The sirolimus dose was adjusted to achieve target whole blood trough sirolimus concentrations of 10 ng/mL to 15 ng/mL (chromatographic method) throughout the 12-month study period. The cyclosporine dose was adjusted to achieve target whole blood trough concentrations of 200 ng/mL to 300 ng/mL through week 2, 150 ng/mL to 200 ng/mL from week 2 to week 26, and 100 ng/mL to 150 ng/mL from week 26 to week 52 [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>] for the observed trough concentrations ranges. Antibody induction was allowed per protocol as prospectively defined at each transplant center, and was used in 88.4% of patients. The study was conducted at 35 centers in the United States. A total of 224 patients received a transplant and at least one dose of sirolimus and cyclosporine and was comprised of 77.2% Black patients, 24.1% repeat renal transplant recipients, and 13.5% patients with high PRA. Efficacy was assessed with the following endpoints, measured at 12 months: efficacy failure (defined as the first occurrence of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection, graft loss, or death), first occurrence of graft loss or death, and renal function as measured by the calculated GFR using the Nankivell formula. The table below summarizes the result of these endpoints.</p><p><span class="Bold">TABLE 16: EFFICACY FAILURE, GRAFT LOSS OR DEATH AND CALCULATED GLOMERULAR FUNCTION RATES (mL/min) BY NANKIVELL EQUATION AT 12 MONTHS POST-TRANSPLANT: STUDY 4</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Parameter</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Sirolimus</span></p><p><span class="Bold">with Cyclosporine, Corticosteroids</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 224)</span></p><p class="First">Efficacy Failure (%)</p><p class="First">23.2</p><p class="First">Graft Loss or Death (%)</p><p class="First">9.8</p><p class="First">Renal Function (mean ± SEM)<span class="Sup">a,b</span></p><p class="First">52.6 ± 1.6</p><p>(n = 222)</p><p>a: Calculated glomerular filtration rate by Nankivell equation.</p><p>b: Patients who had graft loss were included in this analysis with GFR set to 0.</p><p>Patient survival at 12 months was 94.6%.

This study was a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial conducted at 111 centers globally, including US and Europe, and was intended to show that renal function was improved by conversion from CNI to sirolimus. Eight hundred thirty (830) patients were enrolled and stratified by baseline calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR, 20 mL/min to 40 mL/min versus greater than 40 mL/min). In this trial there was no benefit associated with conversion with regard to improvement in renal function and a greater incidence of proteinuria in the sirolimus conversion arm. In addition, enrollment of patients with baseline calculated GFR less than 40 mL/min was discontinued due to a higher rate of serious adverse events, including pneumonia, acute rejection, graft loss and death [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.4)</span>].</p><p>This study compared renal transplant patients (6 to 120 months after transplantation) who were converted from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus, with patients who continued to receive calcineurin inhibitors. Concomitant immunosuppressive medications included mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine (AZA), and corticosteroids. Sirolimus was initiated with a single loading dose of 12 mg to 20 mg, after which dosing was adjusted to achieve a target sirolimus whole blood trough concentration of 8 ng/mL  to 20 ng/mL (chromatographic method). The efficacy endpoint was calculated GFR at 12 months post-randomization. Additional endpoints included biopsy-confirmed acute rejection, graft loss, and death.

This was particularly true among patients with existing abnormal urinary protein excretion prior to conversion.</p><p>In an open-label, randomized, comparative, multicenter study where kidney transplant patients were either converted from tacrolimus to sirolimus 3 to 5 months post-transplant (sirolimus group) or remained on tacrolimus, there was no significant difference in renal function at 2 years post-transplant. Overall, 44/131 (33.6%) discontinued treatment in the sirolimus group versus 12/123 (9.8%) in the tacrolimus group. More patients reported adverse events 130/131 (99.2%) versus 112/123 (91.1%) and more patients reported discontinuations from the treatment due to adverse events 28/131 (21.4%) versus 4/123 (3.3%) in the sirolimus group compared to the tacrolimus group.</p><p>The incidence of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection was higher for patients in the sirolimus group 11/131 (8.4%) compared to the tacrolimus group 2/123 (1.6%) through 2 years post-transplant. The rate of new-onset diabetes mellitus post-randomization, defined as 30 days or longer of continuous or at least 25 days non-stop (without gap) use of any diabetic treatment after randomization, a fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL or a non-fasting glucose ≥200 mg/dL, was higher in the sirolimus group 15/82 (18.3%) compared to the tacrolimus group 4/72 (5.6%). A greater incidence of proteinuria, was seen in the sirolimus group 19/131 (14.5%) versus 2/123 (1.6%) in the tacrolimus group.</p><h3>Conversion from a CNI-based Regimen to a Sirolimus-based Regimen in Liver Transplant Patients</h3><p class="First">Conversion from a CNI-based regimen to a sirolimus-based regimen was assessed in stable liver transplant patients 6 to 144 months post-transplant. The clinical study was a 2:1 randomized, multi-center, controlled trial conducted at 82 centers globally, including the US and Europe, and was intended to show that renal function was improved by conversion from a CNI to sirolimus without adversely impacting efficacy or safety. A total of 607 patients were enrolled.</p><p>The study failed to demonstrate superiority of conversion to a sirolimus-based regimen compared to continuation of a CNI-based regimen in baseline-adjusted GFR, as estimated by Cockcroft-Gault, at 12 months (62 mL/min in the sirolimus conversion group and 63 mL/min in the CNI continuation group). The study also failed to demonstrate non-inferiority, with respect to the composite endpoint consisting of graft loss and death (including patients with missing survival data) in the sirolimus conversion group compared to the CNI continuation group (6.6% versus 5.6%). The number of deaths in the sirolimus conversion group (15/393, 3.8%) was higher than in the CNI continuation group (3/214, 1.4%), although the difference was not statistically significant. The rates of premature study discontinuation (primarily due to adverse events or lack of efficacy), adverse events overall (infections, specifically), and biopsy-proven acute liver graft rejection at 12 months were all significantly greater in the sirolimus conversion group compared to the CNI continuation group.</p><h3>Pediatric Renal Transplant Patients</h3><p class="First">Sirolimus was evaluated in a 36-month, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial at 14 North American centers in pediatric (aged 3 to &lt; 18 years) renal transplant patients considered to be at high-immunologic risk for developing chronic allograft nephropathy, defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and/or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy. Seventy-eight (78) subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to sirolimus (sirolimus target concentrations of 5 ng/mL to 15 ng/mL, by chromatographic assay, n = 53) in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and corticosteroids or to continue calcineurin-inhibitor-based immunosuppressive therapy (n = 25). The primary endpoint of the study was efficacy failure as defined by the first occurrence of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection, graft loss, or death, and the trial was designed to show superiority of sirolimus added to a calcineurin-inhibitor-based immunosuppressive regimen compared to a calcineurin-inhibitor-based regimen. The cumulative incidence of efficacy failure up to 36 months was 45.3% in the sirolimus group compared to 44% in the control group, and did not demonstrate superiority. There was one death in each group. The use of sirolimus in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with an increased risk of deterioration of renal function, serum lipid abnormalities (including, but not limited to, increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol), and urinary tract infections [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>]. This study does not support the addition of sirolimus to calcineurin-inhibitor-based immunosuppressive therapy in this subpopulation of pediatric renal transplant patients.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clinical Therapeutics</span>, Volume 22, Supplement B, April 2000 [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.5)</span>].</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Since Sirolimus Oral Solution is not absorbed through the skin, there are no special precautions.
