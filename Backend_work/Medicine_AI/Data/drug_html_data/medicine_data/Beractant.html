Beractant is similar to the natural fluid in the lungs that helps maintain effective breathing.</p><p>Beractant is used to treat or prevent respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in a premature baby whose lungs have not fully developed.</p><p>Beractant may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Your baby will receive this medication in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or similar hospital setting.</p><p>Beractant is given directly into the baby's lungs through a breathing tube that is also connected to a ventilator (a machine that moves air in and out of the lungs to help your baby breathe easier and get enough oxygen).</p><p>Your baby will remain under constant supervision during treatment with beractant.</p><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on feeding or other medications after your child has been treated with beractant.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>To best participate in the care of your baby while he or she is in the NICU, carefully follow all instructions provided by your baby's caregivers.</p><h2>How is beractant given?</h2><p>Beractant is given directly into the baby's lungs through a breathing tube. Your baby will receive this medication in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or similar hospital setting.</p><p>The breathing tube is connected to a ventilator (a machine that moves air in and out of the lungs to help your baby breathe easier and get enough oxygen).</p><p>Beractant is given as soon as possible after the baby's birth, usually within minutes or hours.</p><p>Your baby's breathing, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and other vital signs will be watched closely during treatment with beractant. This will help your doctor determine how long to continue treatment with beractant. Your child may also need blood tests.</p><h2>What happens if my child misses a dose?</h2><p>Since beractant is given as needed by a healthcare professional, it is not likely that your baby will miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if my child receives an overdose?</h2><p>Since beractant is given in a controlled medical setting by a healthcare professional, an overdose is not likely to occur.
