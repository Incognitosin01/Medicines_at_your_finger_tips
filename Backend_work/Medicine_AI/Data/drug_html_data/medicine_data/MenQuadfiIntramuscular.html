The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.</p><p>This vaccine is active against Groups A, C, W, and Y meningococcal bacteria only. The vaccine will not protect against infection caused by other meningococcal bacteria groups, such as Group B.</p><p>Meningococcal infection can cause life-threatening illnesses, such as meningococcal meningitis, which affects the brain, and meningococcemia, which affects the blood. Some persons with meningococcal meningitis and/or meningococcemia also may die. These diseases are more likely to occur in young children and in persons with certain diseases or conditions that make them more susceptible to a meningococcal infection or more likely to develop serious problems from a meningococcal infection.</p><p>This vaccine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using MenQuadfi</h2><p>In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do.
