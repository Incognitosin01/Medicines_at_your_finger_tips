</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ACTIVE INGREDIENTS:</span> Each 5 mL (teaspoonful) contains:</p><p>Phenylephrine Hydrochloride ..... 7.5 mg<br/>
Guaifenesin ..... 100 mg</p><p><span class="Bold">INACTIVE INGREDIENTS:</span> Citric Acid, Orange Flavoring, Sorbitol Solution, Propylene Glycol, Purified Water, Saccharin Sodium, Sodium Benzoate, and Sodium Chloride.</p><h3>Phenylephrine hydrochloride</h3><p class="First">Benzenemethanol,3-hydroxy-α-[(methylamino) methyl]-hydrochloride (R)-., is an adrenergic, which occurs as white or practically white, odorless crystals having a bitter taste. It is freely soluble in water and alcohol.</p><h3>Guaifenesin</h3><p class="First">1,2-Propanediol, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-, (±)-., is a white to slightly gray, crystalline powder, having a bitter taste. It may have a slight characteristic odor. It is soluble in water, alcohol, chloroform, glycerin, and propylene glycol.</p><h2>Crantex - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Phenylephrine HCI is a sympathomimetic which acts predominantly on alpha receptors and has little action on beta receptors, therefore it functions as an oral nasal decongestant with minimal CNS stimulation. Guaifenesin has an expectorant action which increases the output of respiratory tract fluid by reducing adhesiveness and surface tension. Sinus and bronchial drainage is improved and dry, non-productive coughs become more productive and less frequent.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Crantex</h2><p class="First">For temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, influenza, and bronchitis.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Crantex Liquid<span class="Sup">®</span> is contraindicated in infants and newborns, and in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components. It is also contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, hyperthyroidism, and in patients on MAO inhibitor therapy (or for 14 days after stopping MAOI therapy). Patient idiosyncrasy to adrenergic agents may be manifested by insomnia, dizziness, weakness, tremor, or arrhythmias.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">MAO inhibitors (or for 14 days after stopping MAOI therapy) and beta adrenergic blockers increase the effects of sympathomimetics. Sympathomimetics may reduce the antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine, and veratrum alkaloids.</p><h3>Drug Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">Guaifenesin may increase renal clearance for urates and thereby lower serum uric acid level.</p><p>Guaifenesin may produce an increase in urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and may therefore interfere with the interpretation of this test for the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome. It may also falsely elevate the VMA test for catechols. Administration of this drug should be discontinued 48 hours prior to the collection of urine specimens for such tests. Stimulants, such as phenylephrine, are banned and tested for by the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of fertility</h3><p class="First">No adequate and well controlled studies have been conducted to determine whether the components of Crantex Liquid<span class="Sup">®</span> have a potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility.</p><h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is also not known whether Crantex Liquid<span class="Sup">®</span> can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women or can affect reproduction capacity. This product should not be given to a pregnant woman.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Due to the possible passage of the ingredients into breast milk, this product should not be given to nursing mothers.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population, under 6, have not been established.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Do not exceed recommended dosage.</span> If nervousness, dizziness, or sleeplessness occur, discontinue use and consult a doctor. If symptoms do not improve within 7 days or are accompanied by a fever, consult a doctor.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Mild central nervous system stimulation, especially in those patients who are hypersensitive to sympathomimetic drugs, may occur. Hyperreactive individuals may display ephedrine-like reactions such as tachycardia, palpitations, headache, dizziness, or nausea. Nervousness, excitability, restlessness, weakness, and insomnia may also occur. Headache and drowsiness have also been reported. Large doses may cause light-headedness, nausea and/or vomiting. Sympathomimetic drugs have also been associated with certain untoward reactions including fear, anxiety, tenseness, restlessness, tremor, weakness, pallor, respiratory difficulty, dysuria, insomnia, hallucination, convulsion, CNS depression, arrhythmias and cardiovascular collapse with hypotension.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Overdosage with sympathomimetic amines can cause cardiac arrhythmias, cerebral hemorrhage and pulmonary edema. It can also cause palpitations, restlessness, dizziness, tremor, vomiting, fear, labored breathing, headache, dryness of mouth, pallor, weakness, panic, anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, hyperactive reflexes, talkativeness, irritability and insomnia. Cardiovascular and renal effects include difficulty in urination, headache, flushing, palpitation, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension with subsequent hypotension and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal effects include dry mouth, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps.</p><p>Overdosage with guaifenesin is unlikely to produce toxic effects since its toxicity is low. Guaifenesin, when administered by stomach tube to test animals in doses up to 0.5 g/kg produced no signs of toxicity.</p><p class="First">The patient should be induced to vomit, even if emesis has occurred spontaneously. Pharmacologic vomiting by the administration of ipecac syrup is a preferred method, however, vomiting should not be induced in patients with impaired consciousness. Precautions against aspiration must be taken, especially in infants and children. Following emesis, any drug remaining in the stomach may be absorbed by activated charcoal administered as slurry with water. Treatment of the signs and symptoms of overdosage is symptomatic and supportive.</p><h2>Crantex Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Adults and Children 12 years and older 1-2 teaspoons every 4-6 hours, not to exceed 8 teaspoons in a 24 hour period.
