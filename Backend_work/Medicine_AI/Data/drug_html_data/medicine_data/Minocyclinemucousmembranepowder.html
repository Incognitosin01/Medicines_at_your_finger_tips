Periodontitis is an infection that causes inflammation in the gums around your teeth. This can cause the gums to pull away from the teeth, leaving deep pockets. Gum shrinkage can lead to tooth loss.</p><p>Minocycline powder may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not be treated with  minocycline if you are allergic to minocycline or to similar antibiotics such as demeclocycline, doxycycline, or tetracycline.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with this medicine if you are allergic to minocycline or to similar antibiotics such as demeclocycline, doxycycline, or tetracycline.</p><p>To make sure minocycline is safe for you, tell your dentist if you have:</p><ul>

Tell your dentist right away if you become pregnant after being treated with this medicine.</p><p>Minocycline passes into breast milk and may affect bone and tooth development in a nursing baby. You should not breast-feed after you are treated with this medicine.</p><h2>How is minocycline given?</h2><p>You will receive  minocycline in a dentist's office.</p><p>Minocycline powder is applied directly into the pockets between your gums and teeth. Your dentist will use a special device to place the medicine into these pockets.</p><p>For at least 1 week after treatment: You should not chew hard or crunchy foods such as carrots, or sticky foods such as hard candy, taffy, or gum.</p><p>For at least 10 days after treatment: You should not use dental floss or a dental pick.</p><p>Minocycline powder is only part of a complete treatment program that also includes good oral hygiene and routine dental care.</p><p>You may need to receive up to 3 treatments spaced 3 months apart. Follow your dentist's instructions very closely.</p><p>Replace your toothbrush with a new one every 3 or 4 months.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your dentist for instructions if you miss an appointment for a repeat treatment.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since  minocycline is given by a dentist in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving minocycline?</h2><p>Avoid exposure to sunlight or tanning beds. Minocycline can make you sunburn more easily. Wear protective clothing and use sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) when you are outdoors.</p><p>Avoid smoking, or consider quitting altogether. Smoking can increase your risk of further gum disease and tooth decay.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Minocycline side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives, itching, severe rash; swollen glands, unusual tiredness, fever, nausea, stomach pain; lower back pain, painful urination, blood or pus in your urine; chest pain, cough with mucus, difficult breathing; jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes); swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Some of these signs of allergic reaction have occurred when minocycline was taken by mouth in a pill form.
