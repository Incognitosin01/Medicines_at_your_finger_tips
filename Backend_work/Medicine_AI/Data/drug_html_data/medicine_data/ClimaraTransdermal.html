It is also used to treat changes in and around the vagina (such as vaginal dryness, itching, and burning) caused by low estrogen levels or menopause. This medicine is also used to treat certain conditions in women before menopause if their ovaries do not make enough estrogens naturally, and prevent osteoporosis after menopause.</p><p>Estradiol is an estrogen hormone. The hormone from the patch, gel, and spray is absorbed through your skin into your body. It works by preventing symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating (hot flashes) in women during menopause.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Climara</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Use of estradiol transdermal patch, gel, and spray is not indicated in the pediatric population.

However, elderly patients are more likely to have breast cancer, stroke, or dementia, which may require caution in patients receiving estradiol transdermal patch, gel and spray.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

It may not be specific to Climara. Please read with care.</b></p><p><i>It is very important that you use this medicine only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may cause unwanted side effects.</p><p><i>This medicine is for use on the skin only</i>. Do not get it in your eyes, nose, mouth, breast, or vagina. Do not use it on skin areas that have cuts, scrapes, or burns. If it does get on these areas, rinse it off right away with water.</p><p>This medicine comes with a patient information insert. Read and follow the instructions in the insert carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using this medicine.</p><p>To use the <i>patch</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water before and after you use this medicine.</li>
<li>Carefully tear open the pouch when you are ready to put the patch on your skin. Do not cut it.</li>
<li>Peel off the backing from the patch and apply the patch to a clean, dry, and hair-free area of the lower stomach or upper buttock area. This area must be free of powder, oil, or lotion for the patch to stick on to your skin.</li>
<li>Press the patch firmly in place with your hand for about 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Do not apply the patch on the breast or over any skin folds. Do not apply the patch on oily, broken, burned, or irritated skin, or areas with skin conditions (such as birth marks, tattoos). Avoid applying the patch on the waistline or other places where tight clothing may rub it off.</li>
<li>Wear the patch at all times until it is time to put on a new patch. Do not expose it to the sun for long periods of time.</li>
<li>When replacing your patch, make sure to apply the new patch to a different area of your lower abdomen. Wait at least 1 week before applying a patch to the same area.</li>
<li>When changing a patch, slowly peel it off from your skin. If you have any patch adhesive left on your skin, allow it to dry for 15 minutes and gently rub the sticky area with oil or lotion to remove it. It is best to change your patch on the same days of each week to help you remember.</li>
<li>You may take a bath, shower, or swim while using this medicine. Doing so will not affect the patch.</li>
<li>If a patch falls off, just put it back on a different area. If the patch does not stick completely, put on a new patch but continue to follow your original schedule for changing your patch.</li>
<li>To throw away a used patch: Fold the patch in half with the sticky side together and place it in a sturdy child-proof container. Throw this container in the trash away from children and pets. Do not flush the patch down the toilet.</li>
</ul><p>To use the <i>spray</i>:</p><ul>
<li>The spray form of this medicine comes in an applicator that delivers a measured amount of estradiol to the skin with each spray. When using a new spray applicator, prime the pump by holding the spray upright and pumping 3 times. Priming is only necessary the first time you use a new spray applicator; do not prime again.</li>
<li>Apply the medicine to clean, dry, and unbroken skin on the inside of the forearm between the elbow and the wrist. Do not apply the medicine directly to your breasts or in or around the vagina.</li>
<li>Allow the medicine to dry for at least 2 minutes before dressing, and at least 1 hour before washing.</li>
<li>If your doctor tells you to increase your dose, move the applicator to an area of the skin next to your previous application site, before applying the second or third spray.</li>
<li>Do not rub EvamistÂ® spray into your skin.</li>
<li>Do not allow your child to touch the area of the arm where the medicine was sprayed. If you cannot avoid being close with your child, wear clothes with long sleeves to cover the application site.</li>
<li>If your child comes in direct contact with the arm where the medicine was sprayed, wash your child's skin right away with soap and water.</li>
<li>Do not allow your pets to lick or touch the arm where the medicine was sprayed.</li>
<li>Always place the protective cover back on the applicator of the spray.</li>
<li>Do not use the applicator for more than 75 sprays.</li>
<li>Apply sunscreen at least 1 hour before applying EvamistÂ®.</li>
</ul><p>To use the <i>gel</i>:</p><ul>
<li>The gel form of this medicine comes in a pump. Each time you press the pump you will get the same amount of medication. You may need to prime the pump by pumping 3 times (EstroGelÂ®) or 10 times (Elestrinâ„¢) the first time you use it. Follow the patient instructions for the container you use. After you prime the pump, do not press the pump more than 1 time each time you use it.</li>
<li>Apply the gel to clean, dry, and unbroken skin. Spread the gel as thinly as possible over the entire area on the inside and outside of your upper arm and shoulder area. Do not apply the medicine directly to your breasts or in or around your vagina.</li>
<li>Do not allow others to come in contact with the area of skin where you applied the gel for at least 1 hour after you use the medicine. Do not allow others to apply the gel for you. Allow the medicine to dry for at least 5 minutes before you dress.</li>
<li>Apply sunscreen at least 25 minutes after using the gel. Avoid applying sunscreen on the same application site for 7 days or more.</li>
</ul><p>The gel and spray contain alcohol and are flammable. Avoid using it near an open flame or while smoking.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.
