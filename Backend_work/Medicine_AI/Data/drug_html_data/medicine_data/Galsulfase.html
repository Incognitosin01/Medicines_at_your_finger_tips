Some people lack this enzyme because of a genetic disorder. Galsulfase helps replace this missing enzyme in such people.</p><p>Galsulfase is used to treat some of the symptoms of a genetic condition called mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MYOO-koe-pol-ee-SAK-a-rye-DOE-sis type 6), or MPS VI, also called Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome.</p><p>MPS VI is a metabolic disorder in which the body lacks the enzyme needed to break down certain natural substances. These substances can build up in the body, causing enlarged organs, abnormal bone structure, changes in facial features, breathing problems, heart problems, vision or hearing loss, and changes in mental or physical abilities.</p><p>Galsulfase may improve walking and stair-climbing ability in people with this condition. However, <b>this medication is not a cure for MPS VI.</b></p><p>Galsulfase may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>An allergic reaction may occur during or shortly after infusion of  galsulfase. <b>Tell your caregivers or get emergency medical help right away if you have any signs of a severe allergic reaction,</b> such as chest pain, trouble breathing, vomiting, skin rash or redness, and feeling like you might pass out.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Your galsulfase infusion may be delayed if you have a fever or cold symptoms.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
