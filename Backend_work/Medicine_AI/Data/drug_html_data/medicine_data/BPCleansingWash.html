</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION:</span> Sodium sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide with antibacterial activity. Sulfur acts as a keratolytic agent. Chemically sodium sulfacetamide is N-[(4-aminophenyl)sulfonyl]-acetamide, monosodium salt, monohydrate. The structural formula is:</p><p></p><p>Each mL of Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% and Sulfur 4% contains 100 mg of sodium sulfacetamide and 40 mg of sulfur in an emulsion base containing urea 10%, butylated hydroxytoluene, cetyl alcohol, disodium EDTA, disodium oleamido MEA sulfosuccinate, glyceryl stearate and PEG 100 stearate, magnesium aluminum silicate, methylparaben, propylparaben, purified water, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, sodium thiosulfate, stearyl alcohol, white petrolatum and xanthan gum.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</span> The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods-Fildes theory, which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth. While absorption through intact skin has not been determined, sodium sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine, largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours. The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown, but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of Propionibacterium acnes and the formation of free fatty acids.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS:</span> BP Cleansing Wash is indicated in the topical control of acne vulgaris, acne rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS:</span> BP Cleansing Wash is contraindicated for use by patients having known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, sulfur or any other component of this preparation. BP Cleansing Wash is not to be used by patients with kidney disease.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span> Although rare, sensitivity to sodium sulfacetamide may occur. Therefore, caution and careful supervision should be observed when prescribing this drug for patients who may be prone to hypersensitivity to topical sulfonamides. Systemic toxic reactions such as agranulocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, purpura hemorrhagica, drug fever, jaundice, and contact dermatitis indicate hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Particular caution should be employed if areas of denuded or abraded skin are involved. <span class="Bold">FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.</span> Keep bottle tightly closed. Keep away from eyes. Keep out of reach of children.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> If irritation develops, use of the product should be discontinued and appropriate therapy started. Patients should be carefully observed for possible local irritation or sensitization during long-term therapy. The object of this therapy is to achieve desquamation without irritation, but sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur can cause reddening and scaling of the epidermis. These side effects are not unusual in the treatment of acne vulgaris, but patients should be cautioned about the possibility.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span> - Avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, lips and mucous membranes. If accidental contact occurs, rinse with water. If excessive irritation develops, discontinue use and consult your physician.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility -</span> Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy -</span> Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with BP Cleansing Wash. When administered to a pregnant woman, it also is not known whether BP Cleansing Wash can affect reproduction capacity or cause fetal harm. BP Cleansing Wash should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers -</span> It is not known whether sodium sulfacetamide is excreted in human milk following topical use of BP Cleansing Wash. However, small amounts of orally administered sulfonamides have been reported to be eliminated in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when BP Cleansing Wash is administered to a nursing woman.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use -</span> Safety and effectiveness in children under the age of 12 have not been established.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS:</span> Although rare, sodium sulfacetamide may cause local irritation.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</span> BP Cleansing Wash: Wash affected area once or twice daily or as directed by your physician. Avoid contact with eyes or mucous membranes. Wet skin and liberally apply to areas to be cleansed, massage gently into skin for 10-20 seconds, working into a full lather, rinse thoroughly and pat dry. If drying occurs, it may be controlled by rinsing off cleansing wash sooner or using less often.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HOW SUPPLIED:</span> BP Cleansing Wash is available in a 16 fl. oz.
