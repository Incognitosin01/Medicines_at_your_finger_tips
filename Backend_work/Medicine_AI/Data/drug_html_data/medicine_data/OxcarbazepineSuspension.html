</ul><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">Oxcarbazepine oral suspension is indicated for use as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults and as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients aged 4 years and above, and as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients aged 2 years and above with partial-onset seizures.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><h3>Adjunctive Therapy for Adults</h3><p class="First">Initiate oxcarbazepine oral suspension with a dose of 600 mg/day, given twice-a-day. If clinically indicated, the dose may be increased by a maximum of 600 mg/day at approximately weekly intervals; the maximum recommended daily dose is 1,200 mg/day.</p><p>Daily doses above 1,200 mg/day show somewhat greater effectiveness in controlled trials, but most patients were not able to tolerate the 2,400 mg/day dose, primarily because of CNS effects.</p><p>Dosage adjustment is recommended with concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers or UGT inducers, which include certain antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Conversion to Monotherapy for Adults</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving concomitant AEDs may be converted to monotherapy by initiating treatment with oxcarbazepine oral suspension at 600 mg/day (given in a twice-a-day regimen) while simultaneously initiating the reduction of the dose of the concomitant AEDs. The concomitant AEDs should be completely withdrawn over 3 to 6 weeks, while the maximum dose of oxcarbazepine oral suspension should be reached in about 2 to 4 weeks. Oxcarbazepine oral suspension may be increased as clinically indicated by a maximum increment of 600 mg/day at approximately weekly intervals to achieve the maximum recommended daily dose of 2,400 mg/day. A daily dose of 1,200 mg/day has been shown in one study to be effective in patients in whom monotherapy has been initiated with oxcarbazepine oral suspension. Patients should be observed closely during this transition phase.</p><h3>Initiation of Monotherapy for Adults</h3><p class="First">Patients not currently being treated with AEDs may have monotherapy initiated with oxcarbazepine oral suspension. In these patients, initiate oxcarbazepine oral suspension at a dose of 600 mg/day (given a twice-a-day); the dose should be increased by 300 mg/day every third day to a dose of 1,200 mg/day. Controlled trials in these patients examined the effectiveness of a 1,200 mg/day dose; a dose of 2,400 mg/day has been shown to be effective in patients converted from other AEDs to oxcarbazepine oral suspension monotherapy (see above).</p><h3>Adjunctive Therapy for Pediatric Patients (Aged 2 to 16 Years)</h3><p class="First">In pediatric patients aged 4 to 16 years, initiate oxcarbazepine oral suspension at a daily dose of 8 to 10 mg/kg generally not to exceed 600 mg/day, given twice-a-day. The target maintenance dose of oxcarbazepine oral suspension should be achieved over 2 weeks, and is dependent upon patient weight, according to the following chart:</p><p>20 to 29 kg – 900 mg/day</p><p>29.1 to 39 kg – 1,200 mg/day</p><p>&gt;39 kg – 1,800 mg/day</p><p>In the clinical trial, in which the intention was to reach these target doses, the median daily dose was 31 mg/kg with a range of 6 to 51 mg/kg.</p><p>In pediatric patients aged 2 to &lt;4 years, initiate oxcarbazepine oral suspension at a daily dose of 8 to 10 mg/kg generally not to exceed 600 mg/day, given twice-a-day. For patients less than 20 kg, a starting dose of 16 to 20 mg/kg may be considered <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. The maximum maintenance dose of oxcarbazepine oral suspension should be achieved over 2 to 4 weeks and should not exceed 60 mg/kg/day in a twice-a-day regimen.</p><p>In the clinical trial in pediatric patients (2 to 4 years of age) in which the intention was to reach the target dose of 60 mg/kg/day, 50% of patients reached a final dose of at least 55 mg/kg/day.</p><p>Under adjunctive therapy (with and without enzyme-inducing AEDs), when normalized by body weight, apparent clearance (L/hr/kg) decreased when age increased such that children 2 to &lt;4 years of age may require up to twice the oxcarbazepine dose per body weight compared to adults; and children 4 to ≤12 years of age may require a 50% higher oxcarbazepine dose per body weight compared to adults.</p><p>Dosage adjustment is recommended with concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers or UGT inducers, which include certain antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Conversion to Monotherapy for Pediatric Patients (Aged 4 to 16 Years)</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving concomitant antiepileptic drugs may be converted to monotherapy by initiating treatment with oxcarbazepine oral suspension at approximately 8 to 10 mg/kg/day given twice-a-day, while simultaneously initiating the reduction of the dose of the concomitant antiepileptic drugs. The concomitant antiepileptic drugs can be completely withdrawn over 3 to 6 weeks while oxcarbazepine oral suspension may be increased as clinically indicated by a maximum increment of 10 mg/kg/day at approximately weekly intervals to achieve the recommended daily dose. Patients should be observed closely during this transition phase.</p><p>The recommended total daily dose of oxcarbazepine oral suspension is shown in Table 1.</p><h3>Initiation of Monotherapy for Pediatric Patients (Aged 4 to 16 Years)</h3><p class="First">Patients not currently being treated with antiepileptic drugs may have monotherapy initiated with oxcarbazepine oral suspension. In these patients, initiate oxcarbazepine oral suspension at a dose of 8 to 10 mg/kg/day given twice-a-day. The dose should be increased by 5 mg/kg/day every third day to the recommended daily dose shown in the table below.</p><p><span class="Bold">T</span><span class="Bold">able 1: Range of Maintenance Doses of</span> <span class="Bold">Oxcarbazepine Oral Suspension for Pediatrics by Weight During Monotherapy</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">From</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">To</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Weight in kg</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose (mg/day)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose (mg/day)</span></p><p class="First">20</p><p class="First">600</p><p class="First">900</p><p class="First">25</p><p class="First">900</p><p class="First">1,200</p><p class="First">30</p><p class="First">900</p><p class="First">1,200</p><p class="First">35</p><p class="First">900</p><p class="First">1,500</p><p class="First">40</p><p class="First">900</p><p class="First">1,500</p><p class="First">45</p><p class="First">1,200</p><p class="First">1,500</p><p class="First">50</p><p class="First">1,200</p><p class="First">1,800</p><p class="First">55</p><p class="First">1,200</p><p class="First">1,800</p><p class="First">60</p><p class="First">1,200</p><p class="First">2,100</p><p class="First">65</p><p class="First">1,200</p><p class="First">2,100</p><p class="First">70</p><p class="First">1,500</p><p class="First">2,100</p><h3>Dosage Modification for Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min) initiate oxcarbazepine oral suspension at one-half the usual starting dose (300 mg/day, given twice-a-day) and increase slowly to achieve the desired clinical response <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Administration Information</h3><p class="First">Oxcarbazepine oral suspension can be taken with or without food <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Before using oxcarbazepine oral suspension, shake the bottle well and prepare the dose immediately afterwards. The prescribed amount of oral suspension should be withdrawn from the bottle using the oral dosing syringe supplied. Oxcarbazepine oral suspension can be mixed in a small glass of water just prior to administration or, alternatively, may be swallowed directly from the syringe. After each use, close the bottle and rinse the syringe with warm water and allow it to dry thoroughly.</p><p>Oxcarbazepine oral suspension and oxcarbazepine film-coated tablets may be interchanged at equal doses.</p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">O</span><span class="Bold">r</span><span class="Bold">al Suspension:</span></p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Oxcarbazepine oral suspension is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to oxcarbazepine or to any of its components, or to eslicarbazepine acetate <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]</span>.</p><h2>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>Hyponatremia</h3><p class="First">Clinically significant hyponatremia (sodium &lt;125 mmol/L) can develop during oxcarbazepine use. In the 14 controlled epilepsy studies 2.5% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients (38/1,524) had a sodium of less than 125 mmol/L at some point during treatment, compared to no such patients assigned placebo or active control (carbamazepine and phenobarbital for adjunctive and monotherapy substitution studies, and phenytoin and valproate for the monotherapy initiation studies). Clinically significant hyponatremia generally occurred during the first 3 months of treatment with oxcarbazepine, although there were patients who first developed a serum sodium &lt;125 mmol/L more than 1 year after initiation of therapy. Most patients who developed hyponatremia were asymptomatic but patients in the clinical trials were frequently monitored and some had their oxcarbazepine dose reduced, discontinued, or had their fluid intake restricted for hyponatremia. Whether or not these maneuvers prevented the occurrence of more severe events is unknown. Cases of symptomatic hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) have been reported during postmarketing use. In clinical trials, patients whose treatment with oxcarbazepine was discontinued due to hyponatremia generally experienced normalization of serum sodium within a few days without additional treatment.</p><p>Measurement of serum sodium levels should be considered for patients during maintenance treatment with oxcarbazepine, particularly if the patient is receiving other medications known to decrease serum sodium levels (e.g., drugs associated with inappropriate ADH secretion) or if symptoms possibly indicating hyponatremia develop (e.g., nausea, malaise, headache, lethargy, confusion, obtundation, or increase in seizure frequency or severity).</p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions and Angioedema</h3><p class="First">Rare cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema involving the larynx, glottis, lips and eyelids have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of oxcarbazepine. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If a patient develops any of these reactions after treatment with oxcarbazepine, the drug should be discontinued and an alternative treatment started. These patients should not be rechallenged with the drug <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Cross Hypersensitivity Reaction to Carbamazepine</h3><p class="First">Approximately 25% to 30% of patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine will experience hypersensitivity reactions with oxcarbazepine. For this reason patients should be specifically questioned about any prior experience with carbamazepine, and patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine should ordinarily be treated with oxcarbazepine only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity develop, oxcarbazepine should be discontinued immediately <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.8)]</span>.</p><h3>Serious Dermatological Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious dermatological reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in both children and adults in association with oxcarbazepine use. Such serious skin reactions may be life threatening, and some patients have required hospitalization with very rare reports of fatal outcome. The median time of onset for reported cases was 19 days after treatment initiation. Recurrence of the serious skin reactions following rechallenge with oxcarbazepine has also been reported.</p><p>The reporting rate of TEN and SJS associated with oxcarbazepine use, which is generally accepted to be an underestimate due to underreporting, exceeds the background incidence rate estimates by a factor of 3- to 10-fold. Estimates of the background incidence rate for these serious skin reactions in the general population range between 0.5 to 6 cases per million-person years. Therefore, if a patient develops a skin reaction while taking oxcarbazepine, consideration should be given to discontinuing oxcarbazepine use and prescribing another antiepileptic medication.</p><p><span class="Bold">A</span><span class="Bold">ssociation with HLA-B*1502</span></p><p>Patients carrying the HLA-B*1502 allele may be at increased risk for SJS/TEN with oxcarbazepine treatment.</p><p>Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) allele B*1502 increases the risk for developing SJS/TEN in patients treated with carbamazepine. The chemical structure of oxcarbazepine is similar to that of carbamazepine. Available clinical evidence, and data from nonclinical studies showing a direct interaction between oxcarbazepine and HLA-B*1502 protein, suggest that the HLA-B*1502 allele may also increase the risk for SJS/TEN with oxcarbazepine.</p><p>The frequency of HLA-B*1502 allele ranges from 2 to 12% in Han Chinese populations, is about 8% in Thai populations, and above 15% in the Philippines and in some Malaysian populations. Allele frequencies up to about 2% and 6% have been reported in Korea and India, respectively. The frequency of the HLA-B*1502 allele is negligible in people from European descent, several African populations, indigenous peoples of the Americas, Hispanic populations, and in Japanese (&lt;1%).</p><p>Testing for the presence of the HLA-B*1502 allele should be considered in patients with ancestry in genetically at-risk populations, prior to initiating treatment with oxcarbazepine. The use of oxcarbazepine should be avoided in patients positive for HLA-B*1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Consideration should also be given to avoid the use of other drugs associated with SJS/TEN in HLA-B*1502 positive patients, when alternative therapies are otherwise equally acceptable. Screening is not generally recommended in patients from populations in which the prevalence of HLAB* 1502 is low, or in current oxcarbazepine users, as the risk of SJS/TEN is largely confined to the first few months of therapy, regardless of HLA B*1502 status.</p><p>The use of HLA-B*1502 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been well characterized.</p><h3>Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</h3><p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including oxcarbazepine, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p><p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p><p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p><p><span class="Bold">T</span><span class="Bold">able 2:  Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Indication</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo Patients with Events Per 1,000 Patients</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Patients with Events Per 1,000 Patients</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Difference:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1,000 Patients</span></p><p class="First">Epilepsy</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">3.4</p><p class="First">3.5</p><p class="First">2.4</p><p class="First">Psychiatric</p><p class="First">5.7</p><p class="First">8.5</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">2.9</p><p class="First">Other</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">1.9</p><p class="First">0.9</p><p class="First">Total</p><p class="First">2.4</p><p class="First">4.3</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">1.9</p><p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.</p><p>Anyone considering prescribing oxcarbazepine or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p><p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p><h3>Withdrawal of AEDs</h3><p class="First">As with most antiepileptic drugs, oxcarbazepine should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) </span>and <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. But if withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse event, rapid discontinuation can be considered.</p><h3>Cognitive/Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Use of oxcarbazepine has been associated with central nervous system-related adverse reactions. The most significant of these can be classified into 3 general categories: 1) cognitive symptoms including psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration, and speech or language problems, 2) somnolence or fatigue, and 3) coordination abnormalities, including ataxia and gait disturbances.</p><p>Patients should be monitored for these signs and symptoms and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on oxcarbazepine to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.</p><p><span class="Bold">A</span><span class="Bold">dult Patients</span></p><p>In one large, fixed-dose study, oxcarbazepine was added to existing AED therapy (up to three concomitant AEDs). By protocol, the dosage of the concomitant AEDs could not be reduced as oxcarbazepine was added, reduction in oxcarbazepine dosage was not allowed if intolerance developed, and patients were discontinued if unable to tolerate their highest target maintenance doses. In this trial, 65% of patients were discontinued because they could not tolerate the 2,400 mg/day dose of oxcarbazepine on top of existing AEDs. The adverse events seen in this study were primarily CNS related and the risk for discontinuation was dose related.</p><p>In this trial, 7.1% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 4% of placebo-treated patients experienced a cognitive adverse reaction. The risk of discontinuation for these events was about 6.5 times greater on oxcarbazepine than on placebo. In addition, 26% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 12% of placebo-treated patients experienced somnolence. The risk of discontinuation for somnolence was about 10 times greater on oxcarbazepine than on placebo. Finally, 28.7% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 6.4% of placebo-treated patients experienced ataxia or gait disturbances. The risk for discontinuation for these events was about 7 times greater on oxcarbazepine than on placebo.</p><p>In a single placebo-controlled monotherapy trial evaluating 2,400 mg/day of oxcarbazepine, no patients in either treatment group discontinued double-blind treatment because of cognitive adverse events, somnolence, ataxia, or gait disturbance.</p><p>In the 2 dose-controlled conversion to monotherapy trials comparing 2,400 mg/day and 300 mg/day oxcarbazepine, 1.1% of patients in the 2,400 mg/day group discontinued double-blind treatment because of somnolence or cognitive adverse reactions compared to 0% in the 300 mg/day group. In these trials, no patients discontinued because of ataxia or gait disturbances in either treatment group.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>A study was conducted in pediatric patients (3 to 17 years old) with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures in which oxcarbazepine was added to existing AED therapy (up to 2 concomitant AEDs). By protocol, the dosage of concomitant AEDs could not be reduced as oxcarbazepine was added. Oxcarbazepine was titrated to reach a target dose ranging from 30 mg/kg to 46 mg/kg (based on a patient’s body weight with fixed doses for predefined weight ranges).</p><p>Cognitive adverse events occurred in 5.8% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients (the single most common event being concentration impairment, 4 of 138 patients) and in 3.1% of patients treated with placebo. In addition, 34.8% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 14.0% of placebo-treated patients experienced somnolence. (No patient discontinued due to a cognitive adverse reaction or somnolence.). Finally, 23.2% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 7.0% of placebo-treated patients experienced ataxia or gait disturbances. Two (1.4%) oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 1 (0.8%) placebo-treated patient discontinued due to ataxia or gait disturbances.</p><h3>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has occurred with oxcarbazepine.  Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident.  If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately.  Oxcarbazepine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.</p><h3>Hematologic Events</h3><p class="First">Rare reports of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and leukopenia have been seen in patients treated with oxcarbazepine during postmarketing experience. Discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of these hematologic events develops.</p><h3>Seizure Control During Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Due to physiological changes during pregnancy, plasma levels of the active metabolite of oxcarbazepine, the 10-monohydroxy derivative (MHD), may gradually decrease throughout pregnancy. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period because MHD levels may return after delivery.</p><h3>Risk of Seizure Aggravation</h3><p class="First">Exacerbation of or new onset primary generalized seizures has been reported with oxcarbazepine. The risk of aggravation of primary generalized seizures is seen especially in children but may also occur in adults. In case of seizure aggravation, oxcarbazepine should be discontinued.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

Data on a limited number of pregnancies from pregnancy registries suggest that oxcarbazepine monotherapy use is associated with congenital malformations (e.g., craniofacial defects such as oral clefts, and cardiac malformations such as ventricular septal defects). Increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (embryolethality, growth retardation) were observed in the offspring of animals treated with either oxcarbazepine or its active 10-hydroxy metabolite (MHD) during pregnancy at doses similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD).</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Increased embryofetal death and decreased fetal body weights were seen at the high dose. Doses ≥300 mg/kg/day were also maternally toxic (decreased body weight gain, clinical signs), but there is no evidence to suggest that teratogenicity was secondary to the maternal effects.</p><p>In a study in which pregnant rabbits were orally administered MHD (0, 20, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day) during organogenesis, embryofetal mortality was increased at the highest dose (1.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). This dose produced only minimal maternal toxicity.</p><p>In a study in which female rats were dosed orally with oxcarbazepine (0, 25, 50, or 150 mg/kg/day) during the latter part of gestation and throughout the lactation period, a persistent reduction in body weights and altered behavior (decreased activity) were observed in offspring exposed to the highest dose (less than the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).

The maximum dose taken was approximately 48,000 mg. All patients recovered with symptomatic treatment. Nausea, vomiting, somnolence, aggression, agitation, hypotension, and tremor each occurred in more than one patient.

Oxcarbazepine is 10,11-Dihydro-10-oxo­-5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide, and its structural formula is:</p><p>Oxcarbazepine, USP is a white to faintly orange crystalline powder. It is slightly soluble in chloroform, dichloromethane, acetone, and methanol and practically insoluble in ethanol, ether and water. Its molecular weight is 252.27.</p><p>Oxcarbazepine oral suspension, USP contains the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, malic acid, methylparaben, polyethylene glycol, pregelatinized starch (maize), propyl paraben, propylene glycol, purified water, saccharin sodium, sodium benzoate, sorbitol, xanthan gum and yellow plum lemon flavor. Hydrochloric acid solution or sodium hydroxide solution may be added for adjustment of pH.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The pharmacological activity of oxcarbazepine is primarily exerted through the 10-monohydroxy metabolite (MHD) of oxcarbazepine <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. The precise mechanism by which oxcarbazepine and MHD exert their anti-seizure effect is unknown; however, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> electrophysiological studies indicate that they produce blockade of voltage-sensitive sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcited neural membranes, inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing, and diminution of propagation of synaptic impulses. These actions are thought to be important in the prevention of seizure spread in the intact brain. In addition, increased potassium conductance and modulation of high-voltage activated calcium channels may contribute to the anticonvulsant effects of the drug. No significant interactions of oxcarbazepine or MHD with brain neurotransmitter or modulator receptor sites have been demonstrated.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Oxcarbazepine and its active metabolite (MHD) exhibit anticonvulsant properties in animal seizure models. They protected rodents against electrically induced tonic extension seizures and, to a lesser degree, chemically induced clonic seizures, and abolished or reduced the frequency of chronically recurring focal seizures in Rhesus monkeys with aluminum implants. No development of tolerance (i.e. attenuation of anticonvulsive activity) was observed in the maximal electroshock test when mice and rats were treated daily for 5 days and 4 weeks, respectively, with oxcarbazepine or MHD.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Following oral administration of oxcarbazepine tablets, oxcarbazepine is completely absorbed and extensively metabolized to its pharmacologically active 10-monohydroxy metabolite (MHD). In a mass balance study in people, only 2% of total radioactivity in plasma was due to unchanged oxcarbazepine, with approximately 70% present as MHD, and the remainder attributable to minor metabolites.</p><p>The half-life of the parent is about 2 hours, while the half-life of MHD is about 9 hours, so that MHD is responsible for most antiepileptic activity.</p><p><span class="Bold">A</span><span class="Bold">bsorption</span></p><p>Based on MHD concentrations, oxcarbazepine tablets and suspension were shown to have similar bioavailability.</p><p>After single-dose administration of oxcarbazepine tablets to healthy male volunteers under fasted conditions, the median t<span class="Sub">max</span> was 4.5 (range 3 to 13) hours. After single-dose administration of oxcarbazepine oral suspension to healthy male volunteers under fasted conditions, the median t<span class="Sub">max</span> was 6 hours.</p><p>Steady-state plasma concentrations of MHD are reached within 2 to 3 days in patients when oxcarbazepine is given twice a day. At steady-state the pharmacokinetics of MHD are linear and show dose proportionality over the dose range of 300 to 2,400 mg/day.</p><p>Although not directly studied, the oral bioavailability of the Oxcarbazepine Suspension is unlikely to be affected under fed conditions. Therefore, Oxcarbazepine Suspension can be taken with or without food.</p><p><span class="Bold">D</span><span class="Bold">i</span><span class="Bold">stribution</span></p><p>The apparent volume of distribution of MHD is 49 L.</p><p>Approximately 40% of MHD is bound to serum proteins, predominantly to albumin. Binding is independent of the serum concentration within the therapeutically relevant range. Oxcarbazepine and MHD do not bind to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Excretion</span></p><p>Oxcarbazepine is rapidly reduced by cytosolic enzymes in the liver to its 10-monohydroxy metabolite, MHD, which is primarily responsible for the pharmacological effect of oxcarbazepine. MHD is metabolized further by conjugation with glucuronic acid. Minor amounts (4% of the dose) are oxidized to the pharmacologically inactive 10,11-dihydroxy metabolite (DHD).</p><p>Oxcarbazepine is cleared from the body mostly in the form of metabolites which are predominantly excreted by the kidneys. More than 95% of the dose appears in the urine, with less than 1% as unchanged oxcarbazepine. Fecal excretion accounts for less than 4% of the administered dose. Approximately 80% of the dose is excreted in the urine either as glucuronides of MHD (49%) or as unchanged MHD (27%); the inactive DHD accounts for approximately 3% and conjugates of MHD and oxcarbazepine account for 13% of the dose.</p><p>The half-life of the parent is about 2 hours, while the half-life of MHD is about 9 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">G</span><span class="Italics">eriatrics</span></p><p>Following administration of single (300 mg) and multiple (600 mg/day) doses of oxcarbazepine to elderly volunteers (60 to 82 years of age), the maximum plasma concentrations and AUC values of MHD were 30% to 60% higher than in younger volunteers (18 to 32 years of age). Comparisons of creatinine clearance in young and elderly volunteers indicate that the difference was due to age-related reductions in creatinine clearance.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatrics</span></p><p>Weight-adjusted MHD clearance decreases as age and weight increases, approaching that of adults. The mean weight-adjusted clearance in children 2 years to &lt;4 years of age is approximately 80% higher on average than that of adults. Therefore, MHD exposure in these children is expected to be about one-half that of adults when treated with a similar weight-adjusted dose. The mean weight-adjusted clearance in children 4 to 12 years of age is approximately 40% higher on average than that of adults. Therefore, MHD exposure in these children is expected to be about three-quarters that of adults when treated with a similar weight-adjusted dose.

No autoinduction has been observed with oxcarbazepine.</p><p>Oxcarbazepine was evaluated in human liver microsomes to determine its capacity to inhibit the major cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for the metabolism of other drugs. Results demonstrate that oxcarbazepine and its pharmacologically active 10-monohydroxy metabolite (MHD) have little or no capacity to function as inhibitors for most of the human cytochrome P450 enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP4A9 and CYP4A11) with the exception of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5. Although inhibition of CYP3A4/5 by oxcarbazepine and MHD did occur at high concentrations, it is not likely to be of clinical significance. The inhibition of CYP2C19 by oxcarbazepine and MHD can cause increased plasma concentrations of drugs that are substrates of CYP2C19, which is clinically relevant.</p><p><span class="Italics">I</span><span class="Italics">n vitro</span>, the UDP-glucuronyl transferase level was increased, indicating induction of this enzyme. Increases of 22% with MHD and 47% with oxcarbazepine were observed. As MHD, the predominant plasma substrate, is only a weak inducer of UDP-glucuronyl transferase, it is unlikely to have an effect on drugs that are mainly eliminated by conjugation through UDP-­glucuronyl transferase (e.g., valproic acid, lamotrigine).</p><p>In addition, oxcarbazepine and MHD induce a subgroup of the cytochrome P450 3A family (CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) responsible for the metabolism of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, oral contraceptives and cyclosporine resulting in a lower plasma concentration of these drugs.</p><p>As binding of MHD to plasma proteins is low (40%), clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are unlikely.</p><ul class="Disk">

In mice, a dose-related increase in the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas was observed at oxcarbazepine doses ≥70 mg/kg/day, which is less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In rats, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was increased in females treated with oxcarbazepine at doses ≥25 mg/kg/day (less than the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), and incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and/or carcinomas were increased in males and females treated with MHD at doses of 600 mg/kg/day (2.4 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and ≥250 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), respectively. There was an increase in the incidence of benign testicular interstitial cell tumors in rats at 250 mg oxcarbazepine/kg/day and at ≥250 mg MHD/kg/day, and an increase in the incidence of granular cell tumors in the cervix and vagina in rats at 600 mg MHD/kg/day.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Oxcarbazepine increased mutation frequencies in the <span class="Italics">i</span><span class="Italics">n vitro</span> Ames test in the absence of metabolic activation. Both oxcarbazepine and MHD produced increases in chromosomal aberrations and polyploidy in the Chinese hamster ovary assay <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in the absence of metabolic activation. MHD was negative in the Ames test, and no mutagenic or clastogenic activity was found with either oxcarbazepine or MHD in V79 Chinese hamster cells <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Oxcarbazepine and MHD were both negative for clastogenic or aneugenic effects (micronucleus formation) in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> rat bone marrow assay.</p><p><span class="Bold">I</span><span class="Bold">m</span><span class="Bold">pairment of Fertility</span></p><p>In a study in which male and female rats were administered oxcarbazepine (0, 25, 75 and 150 mg/kg/day) orally prior to and during mating and continuing in females during gestation, no adverse effects on fertility or reproductive performance were observed. The highest dose tested is less than the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In a fertility study in which rats were administered MHD (0, 50, 150, or 450 mg/kg/day) orally prior to and during mating and early gestation, estrous cyclicity was disrupted and numbers of corpora lutea, implantations, and live embryos were reduced in females receiving the highest dose (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p><h2>CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First">The effectiveness of oxcarbazepine as adjunctive and monotherapy for partial-onset seizures in adults, and as adjunctive therapy in children aged 2 to 16 years was established in seven multicenter, randomized, controlled trials.</p><p>The effectiveness of oxcarbazepine as monotherapy for partial-onset seizures in children aged 4 to 16 years was determined from data obtained in the studies described, as well as by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic considerations.</p><h3>Oxcarbazepine Monotherapy Trials</h3><p class="First">Four randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter trials, conducted in a predominately adult population, demonstrated the efficacy of oxcarbazepine as monotherapy. Two trials compared oxcarbazepine to placebo and 2 trials used a randomized withdrawal design to compare a high dose (2,400 mg) with a low dose (300 mg) of oxcarbazepine, after substituting oxcarbazepine 2,400 mg/day for 1 or more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). All doses were administered on a twice-a-day schedule. A fifth randomized, controlled, rater-blind, multicenter study, conducted in a pediatric population, failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between low and high dose oxcarbazepine treatment groups.</p><p>One placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 102 patients (11 to 62 years of age) with refractory partial-onset seizures who had completed an inpatient evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Patients had been withdrawn from all AEDs and were required to have 2 to 10 partial-onset seizures within 48 hours prior to randomization. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo or oxcarbazepine given as 1,500 mg/day on Day 1 and 2,400 mg/day thereafter for an additional 9 days, or until 1 of the following 3 exit criteria occurred: 1) the occurrence of a fourth partial-onset seizure, excluding Day 1, 2) 2 new-onset secondarily generalized seizures, where such seizures were not seen in the 1-year period prior to randomization, or 3) occurrence of serial seizures or status epilepticus. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between-group comparison of the time to meet exit criteria. There was a statistically significant difference in favor of oxcarbazepine (see Figure 1), p=0.0001.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Exit Rate by Treatment Group</span></p><p>The second placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 67 untreated patients (8 to 69 years of age) with newly-diagnosed and recent-onset partial seizures. Patients were randomized to placebo or oxcarbazepine, initiated at 300 mg twice a day and titrated to 1,200 mg/day (given as 600 mg twice a day) in 6 days, followed by maintenance treatment for 84 days. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between-group comparison of the time to first seizure. The difference between the 2 treatments was statistically significant in favor of oxcarbazepine (see Figure 2), p=0.046.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier Estimates of First Seizure Event Rate by Treatment Group</span></p><p>A third trial substituted oxcarbazepine monotherapy at 2,400 mg/day for carbamazepine in 143 patients (12 to 65 years of age) whose partial-onset seizures were inadequately controlled on carbamazepine (CBZ) monotherapy at a stable dose of 800 to 1,600 mg/day, and maintained this oxcarbazepine dose for 56 days (baseline phase). Patients who were able to tolerate titration of oxcarbazepine to 2,400 mg/day during simultaneous carbamazepine withdrawal were randomly assigned to either 300 mg/day of oxcarbazepine or 2,400 mg/day oxcarbazepine. Patients were observed for 126 days or until 1 of the following 4 exit criteria occurred: 1) a doubling of the 28-day seizure frequency compared to baseline, 2) a 2-fold increase in the highest consecutive 2-day seizure frequency during baseline, 3) a single generalized seizure if none had occurred during baseline, or 4) a prolonged generalized seizure. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between-group comparison of the time to meet exit criteria. The difference between the curves was statistically significant in favor of the oxcarbazepine 2,400 mg/day group (see Figure 3), p=0.0001.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 3: Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Exit Rate by Treatment Group</span></p><p>Another monotherapy substitution trial was conducted in 87 patients (11 to 66 years of age) whose seizures were inadequately controlled on 1 or 2 AEDs. Patients were randomized to either oxcarbazepine 2,400 mg/day or 300 mg/day and their standard AED regimen(s) were eliminated over the first 6 weeks of double-blind therapy. Double-blind treatment continued for another 84 days (total double-blind treatment of 126 days) or until 1 of the 4 exit criteria described for the previous study occurred. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between-group comparison of the percentage of patients meeting exit criteria. The results were statistically significant in favor of the oxcarbazepine 2,400 mg/day group (14/34; 41.2%) compared to the oxcarbazepine 300 mg/day group (42/45; 93.3%) (p &lt;0.0001). The time to meeting one of the exit criteria was also statistically significant in favor of the oxcarbazepine 2,400 mg/day group (see Figure 4), p=0.0001.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Exit Rate by Treatment Group</span></p><p>A monotherapy trial was conducted in 92 pediatric patients (1 month to 16 years of age) with inadequately-controlled or new-onset partial seizures. Patients were hospitalized and randomized to either oxcarbazepine 10 mg/kg/day or were titrated up to 40 to 60 mg/kg/day within 3 days while withdrawing the previous AED on the second day of oxcarbazepine. Seizures were recorded through continuous video-EEG monitoring from Day 3 to Day 5. Patients either completed the 5­-day treatment or met 1 of the 2 exit criteria: 1) three study-specific seizures (i.e. electrographic partial-onset seizures with a behavioral correlate), 2) a prolonged study-specific seizure. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between-group comparison of the time to meet exit criteria in which the difference between the curves was not statistically significant (p=0.904). The majority of patients from both dose groups completed the 5-day study without exiting.</p><p>Although this study failed to demonstrate an effect of oxcarbazepine as monotherapy in pediatric patients, several design elements, including the short treatment and assessment period, the absence of a true placebo, and the likely persistence of plasma levels of previously administered AEDs during the treatment period, make the results uninterpretable. For this reason, the results do not undermine the conclusion, based on pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic considerations, that oxcarbazepine is effective as monotherapy in pediatric patients 4 years old and older.</p><h3>Oxcarbazepine Adjunctive Therapy Trials</h3><p class="First">The effectiveness of oxcarbazepine as an adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures was established in 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, one in 692 patients (15 to 66 years of age) and one in 264 pediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age), and in one multicenter, rater-blind, randomized, age-stratified, parallel-group study comparing 2 doses of oxcarbazepine in 128 pediatric patients (1 month to &lt;4 years of age).</p><p>Patients in the 2 placebo-controlled trials were on 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs. In both of the trials, patients were stabilized on optimum dosages of their concomitant AEDs during an 8-week baseline phase. Patients who experienced at least 8 (minimum of 1 to 4 per month) partial-onset seizures during the baseline phase were randomly assigned to placebo or to a specific dose of oxcarbazepine in addition to their other AEDs.</p><p>In these studies, the dose was increased over a 2-week period until either the assigned dose was reached, or intolerance prevented increases. Patients then entered a 14- (pediatrics) or 24-week (adults) maintenance period.</p><p>In the adult trial, patients received fixed doses of 600, 1,200 or 2,400 mg/day. In the pediatric trial, patients received maintenance doses in the range of 30 to 46 mg/kg/day, depending on baseline weight. The primary measure of effectiveness in both trials was a between-group comparison of the percentage change in partial-onset seizure frequency in the double-blind treatment phase relative to baseline phase. This comparison was statistically significant in favor of oxcarbazepine at all doses tested in both trials (p=0.0001 for all doses for both trials). The number of patients randomized to each dose, the median baseline seizure rate, and the median percentage seizure rate reduction for each trial are shown in Table 8. It is important to note that in the high-dose group in the study in adults, over 65% of patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events; only 46 (27%) of the patients in this group completed the 28-week study <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>, an outcome not seen in the monotherapy studies.</p><p><span class="Bold">T</span><span class="Bold">able 8:  Summary of Percentage Change in Partial-Onset Seizure Frequency from Baseline for Placebo-Controlled Adjunctive Therapy Trials</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Trial</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment Group</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">N</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Baseline<br/>

Because there were very few patients over the age of 65 years in controlled trials, the effect of the drug in the elderly has not been adequately assessed.</p><p>The third adjunctive therapy trial enrolled 128 pediatric patients (1 month to &lt;4 years of age) with inadequately-controlled partial-onset seizures on 1 to 2 concomitant AEDs. Patients who experienced at least 2 study-specific seizures (i.e. electrographic partial-onset seizures with a behavioral correlate) during the 72-hour baseline period were randomly assigned to either oxcarbazepine 10 mg/kg/day or were titrated up to 60 mg/kg/day within 26 days. Patients were maintained on their randomized target dose for 9 days and seizures were recorded through continuous video-EEG monitoring during the last 72 hours of the maintenance period. The primary measure of effectiveness in this trial was a between-group comparison of the change in seizure frequency per 24 hours compared to the seizure frequency at baseline. For the entire group of patients enrolled, this comparison was statistically significant in favor of oxcarbazepine 60 mg/kg/day. In this study, there was no evidence that oxcarbazepine was effective in patients below the age of 2 years (N=75).</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Oxcarbazepine Oral Suspension</span></p><p>Oxcarbazepine Oral Suspension USP, 300 mg/5 mL (60 mg/mL), is supplied as off-white to slightly yellow colored suspension.
