Meningococcal bacteria can infect the spinal cord and brain, causing meningitis that can be fatal. Meningococcal disease can also lead to permanent and disabling medical problems.</p><p>Meningococcal disease can spread from one person to another through small droplets of saliva released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The bacteria can also live on things the infected person has touched, such as a door handle or other surface. The bacteria can also be passed through kissing, or sharing a drinking glass or eating utensil with an infected person.</p><p>Meningococcal disease is more likely to occur in babies younger than 1 year, in young people ages 16 to 23 years, in anyone with a weak immune system, and in anyone exposed to an outbreak of the disease.</p><p>Trumenba is used to prevent infection caused by serogroup B meningococcal bacteria. This vaccine contains four common strains of group B meningococcal bacteria.</p><p>This vaccine helps your body develop immunity to meningitis, but will not treat an active infection you already have.</p><p>Trumenba is for use in children and young adults who are 10 to 25 years old. The Centers for Disease Control recommends that the best time to get this vaccine is between the ages of 16 and 18 years old.</p><p>Like any vaccine, the Trumenba may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive this vaccine if you have ever had an allergic reaction to  Trumenba.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive this vaccine if you have ever had an allergic reaction to Trumenba.</p><p>If you have any of these other conditions, your vaccine may need to be postponed or not given at all:</p><ul>
