Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill) that helps prevent your body from absorbing too much salt, which can cause fluid retention.</p><p>Lisinopril is in an ACE inhibitor. ACE stands for angiotensin converting enzyme. Lisinopril lowers blood pressure and also relieves symptoms of fluid retention.</p><p>Zestoretic is used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). Lowering blood pressure may lower your risk of a stroke or heart attack.</p><p>Zestoretic may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use Zestoretic if you are pregnant.
