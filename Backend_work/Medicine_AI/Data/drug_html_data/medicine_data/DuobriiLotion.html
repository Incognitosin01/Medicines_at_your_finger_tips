</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Duobrii Lotion</h2><p class="First">DUOBRII<span class="Sup">®</span> (halobetasol propionate and tazarotene) Lotion, 0.01%/0.045% is indicated for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults.</p><h2>Duobrii Lotion Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Apply a thin layer of Duobrii Lotion once daily to cover only affected areas and rub in gently. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the lotion.</p><p>The total dosage should not exceed approximately 50 g per week because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>. Do not use with occlusive dressings unless directed by a physician. Discontinue treatment when control is achieved. Avoid application of Duobrii Lotion on the face, groin, or in the axillae.</p><p>Duobrii Lotion is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Lotion, 0.01%/0.045%</p><p>Each gram of Duobrii Lotion contains 0.1 mg (0.01%) halobetasol propionate and 0.45 mg (0.045%) tazarotene in a white to off-white lotion.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Duobrii Lotion is contraindicated in pregnancy [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions</span> (5.1), <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations</span> (8.1, 8.3)].</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Embryofetal Risk</h3><p class="First">Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, Duobrii Lotion may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Tazarotene is teratogenic, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> Tazarotene elicits teratogenic and developmental effects associated with retinoids after topical or systemic administration in rats and rabbits <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><p>Advise pregnant females of the potential risk to a fetus. Obtain a pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to Duobrii Lotion therapy. Initiate Duobrii Lotion therapy during a menstrual period. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Duobrii Lotion therapy <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression and Other Unwanted Systemic Glucocorticoid Effects</h3><p class="First">Duobrii Lotion contains halobetasol propionate, a corticosteroid, and has been shown to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.</p><p>Systemic effects of topical corticosteroids may include reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment of the topical corticosteroid.</p><p>The potential for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with Duobrii Lotion was evaluated in a study of 20 adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis involving ≥20% of their body surface area. The subjects were treated once daily for 8 weeks and assessed for HPA axis suppression at Weeks 4 and 8. HPA axis suppression occurred in 3 out of 20 (15%) subjects at Week 4 and none (0%) of these 20 subjects had HPA axis suppression at Week 8 <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p>Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids, including Duobrii Lotion, may require that patients be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, occlusive use, use on an altered skin barrier, concomitant use of multiple corticosteroid-containing products, liver failure, and young age. An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression.</p><p>If HPA axis suppression is documented, attempt to gradually withdraw the drug or reduce the frequency of application. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids.</p><p>Systemic effects of topical corticosteroids may also include Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic exposure to topical corticosteroids. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible than adults to systemic toxicity from the use of topical corticosteroids because of their larger surface-to-body-mass ratio <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Local Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, folliculitis and contact dermatitis. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. If these adverse reactions occur, discontinue the medication at least until the integrity of the skin is restored; do not resume treatment if allergic contact dermatitis is identified.</p><p>Avoid use of Duobrii Lotion on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation.</p><h3>Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn</h3><p class="First">Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of Duobrii Lotion. Patients must be instructed to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using Duobrii Lotion. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use Duobrii Lotion until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using Duobrii Lotion.</p><p>Duobrii Lotion should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity.</p><h3>Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Use of topical corticosteroids may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported postmarketing with the use of topical corticosteroid products.<span class="Italics"> </span> Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation.</p><h3>Concomitant Skin Infections</h3><p class="First">Use an appropriate antimicrobial agent if a skin infection is present or develops. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, discontinue use of Duobrii Lotion until the infection has been adequately treated.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>In randomized, double-blind, multicenter, vehicle-controlled clinical trials, 410 adults with plaque psoriasis were treated with Duobrii Lotion or vehicle lotion and had post-baseline safety data. Subjects applied Duobrii Lotion or vehicle lotion once daily for up to 8 weeks. Table 1 presents adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of subjects treated with Duobrii Lotion and more frequently than in vehicle-treated subjects.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reaction</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Duobrii Lotion</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=270)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vehicle Lotion</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=140)</span></p><p class="First">Contact Dermatitis</p><p class="First">20 (7%)</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">Application Site Pain</p><p class="First">7 (3%)</p><p class="First">1 (1%)</p><p class="First">Folliculitis</p><p class="First">5 (2%)</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">Skin Atrophy</p><p class="First">5 (2%)</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">Excoriation</p><p class="First">5 (2%)</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">Rash</p><p class="First">4 (1%)</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">Skin Abrasion</p><p class="First">3 (1%)</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">Skin Exfoliation</p><p class="First">2 (1%)</p><p class="First">0</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>Based on data from animal reproduction studies, retinoid pharmacology, and the potential for systemic absorption, Duobrii Lotion may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant females has not been established. The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from Duobrii Lotion during pregnancy; therefore, Duobrii Lotion should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Observational studies suggest an increased risk of low birthweight in infants with the maternal use of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>). </p><p>In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification were observed after topical administration of a tazarotene gel formulation during the period of organogenesis at a dose 11 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (based on AUC comparison). In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies were observed after topical administration of a tazarotene gel formulation at 116 times the MRHD (based on AUC comparison) <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, malformations, fetal toxicity, developmental delays, and/or behavioral delays were observed after oral administration of tazarotene during the period of organogenesis at doses 9 and 228 times, respectively, the MRHD (based on AUC comparison). In pregnant rats, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal body weights, and increased malformations were observed after oral administration of tazarotene prior to mating through early gestation at doses 9 times the MRHD (based on AUC comparison) <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, increased malformations, including cleft palate and omphalocele, were observed after oral administration of halobetasol propionate during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. The available data do not support relevant comparisons of systemic halobetasol propionate exposures achieved in the animal studies to exposures observed in humans after topical use of Duobrii Lotion.</p><p>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4%, and of miscarriage is 15 to 20%, of clinically recognized pregnancies.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Data</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Available observational studies in pregnant women did not identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, preterm delivery, or fetal mortality with the use of topical corticosteroids of any potency.  However, when the dispensed amount of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids exceeded 300 g during the entire pregnancy, maternal use was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight in infants.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Animal Data</span></span></p><p>Halobetasol propionate has been shown to cause malformations in rats and rabbits when given orally during organogenesis at doses of 0.04 to 0.1 mg/kg/day in rats and 0.01 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Halobetasol propionate was embryotoxic in rabbits but not in rats. Cleft palate was observed in both rats and rabbits. Omphalocele was seen in rats but not in rabbits.</p><p>In an embryofetal development study in rats, a tazarotene gel formulation, 0.5% (0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene) was topically administered to pregnant rats during gestation days 6 through 17. Reduced fetal body weights and reduced skeletal ossification occurred at this dose (11 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). In an embryofetal development study in rabbits, a tazarotene gel formulation (0.5%, 0.25 mg/kg/day tazarotene) was topically administered to pregnant rabbits during gestation days 6 through 18. Single incidences of known retinoid malformations, including spina bifida, hydrocephaly, and heart anomalies were noted at this dose (116 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison).</p><p>When tazarotene was given orally to animals, developmental delays were seen in rats; malformations and post-implantation loss were observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing 9 and 228 times, respectively, the MRHD (based on AUC comparisons).</p><p>In female rats orally administered 2 mg/kg/day of tazarotene from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7, classic developmental effects of retinoids including decreased number of implantation sites, decreased litter size, decreased numbers of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weights were observed at this dose (16 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison). A low incidence of retinoid-related malformations was observed at that dose.</p><p>In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study, topical administration of a tazarotene gel formulation (0.125 mg/kg/day) to pregnant female rats from gestation day 16 through lactation day 20 reduced pup survival but did not affect the reproductive capacity of the offspring. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat at this dose would be equivalent to 5 times the MRHD (based on AUC comparison).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of tazarotene, halobetasol propionate or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production after treatment with Duobrii Lotion.</p><p>After single topical doses of a <span class="Sup">14</span>C-tazarotene gel formulation to the skin of lactating rats, radioactivity was detected in rat milk.</p><p>It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Duobrii Lotion and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Duobrii Lotion.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></span></p><p>Advise breastfeeding women not to apply Duobrii Lotion directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Duobrii Lotion is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Females of <span class="Bold">reproductive</span> potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth control measures during treatment with Duobrii Lotion. The possibility that a female of reproductive potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. A negative result for pregnancy should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to Duobrii Lotion therapy, which should begin during menstruation.</p><p>Based on animal studies, Duobrii Lotion may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Duobrii Lotion.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Duobrii Lotion in pediatric patients under the age of 18 years have not been evaluated.</p><p>Because of higher skin-surface-area-to-body-mass ratios, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression and Cushing’s syndrome when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of adrenal insufficiency during or after withdrawal of treatment. Adverse reactions including striae have been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p>HPA axis suppression, Cushing’s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include low plasma cortisol levels and an absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 270 subjects exposed to Duobrii Lotion in clinical trials, 39 subjects were 65 years or older. Clinical trials of Duobrii Lotion did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p><h2>Duobrii Lotion Description</h2><p class="First">Duobrii Lotion is a combination product with halobetasol propionate and tazarotene as the active ingredients in a white to off-white lotion formulation intended for topical use.</p><p>Halobetasol propionate is a synthetic corticosteroid. The chemical name for halobetasol propionate is [(6S,9R,16S,17R)-17-(2-chloroacetyl)-6,9-difluoro-11-hydroxy-10,13,16-trimethyl-3-oxo-6,7,8,11,12,14,15,16-octahydrocyclopenta[a]phenanthren-17-yl] propanoate.

The chemical name for tazarotene is 6-[(3,4-Dihydro-4,4-dimethyl-2H-1-benzothiopyran-6-yl)ethynyl]-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid ethyl ester. The structural formula for tazarotene is represented below:</p><p>Molecular Formula: C<span class="Sub">21</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>NO<span class="Sub">2</span>S Molecular Weight: 351.46</p><p>Each gram of Duobrii Lotion contains 0.1 mg (0.01%) halobetasol propionate and 0.45 mg (0.045%) tazarotene in a white to off-white lotion base consisting of carbomer copolymer type B, carbomer homopolymer type A, diethyl sebacate, edetate disodium dihydrate, light mineral oil, methylparaben, propylparaben, purified water, sodium hydroxide, sorbitan monooleate and sorbitol solution, 70%.</p><h2>Duobrii Lotion - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation, and protein regulation; however, the precise mechanism of action in plaque psoriasis is unknown.</p><p>Tazarotene is a retinoid prodrug which is converted to its active form, tazarotenic acid, the carboxylic acid of tazarotene, by deesterification. Tazarotenic acid binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RARα, RARβ and RARγ, but shows relative selectivity for RARβ, and RARγ and may modify gene expression. The clinical significance of these findings for the treatment of plaque psoriasis is unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">A vasoconstrictor assay in healthy subjects with Duobrii Lotion indicated that it is in the high to super-high range of potency as compared to other topical corticosteroids; however, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence.</p><p>The potential for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression was evaluated in a study in adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. A median dose of 8.2 grams Duobrii Lotion was applied once daily for 8 weeks and 20 subjects were assessed for HPA axis suppression at Weeks 4 and 8. HPA axis suppression was observed in 3 out of 20 (15%) subjects at Week 4. None of the 20 (0%) subjects had HPA axis suppression at Week 8. In this study, the criteria for HPA axis suppression was a serum cortisol level of less than or equal to 18 micrograms per deciliter 30 minutes after stimulation with cosyntropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone). <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.2).]</span></p><p>The pharmacodynamics of tazarotene is unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid.</p><p>Systemic exposure following topical application of Duobrii Lotion was evaluated in the same study that evaluated the HPA axis suppression. It was an open-label, randomized, pharmacokinetics (PK) study conducted in subjects aged 18 years and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis affecting at least 20% body surface area. The PK of halobetasol propionate, tazarotene, and tazarotenic acid was evaluated in 22 subjects following application of Duobrii Lotion to the affected area once daily for 28 days. Systemic concentrations of halobetasol propionate (lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) = 50 pg/mL) and tazarotene (LLOQ = 5 pg/mL) on Day 28 were quantifiable in 13 and 18 out of a total number of 22 subjects, respectively. Tazarotenic acid (LLOQ = 5 pg/mL) was quantifiable in all subjects. Systemic exposure of the three moieties was at or near steady state by Day 28. The mean (standard deviation) of PK parameters on Day 28 is shown in Table 2.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mean (Standard Deviation) (N=22)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PK Parameters</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Halobetasol Propionate</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tazarotene</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tazarotenic Acid</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Day 28</span></p><p class="First">C<span class="Sub">max</span> (pg/mL)</p><p class="First">101.9 (135.4)</p><p class="First">24.6 (27.3)</p><p class="First">523.4 (523.3)</p><p class="First">AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> (pg*hr/mL)</p><p class="First">1300 (1959)</p><p class="First">273 (403)</p><p class="First">9954 (10091)</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of halobetasol propionate.</p><p>A long-term study of tazarotene following oral administration of 0.025, 0.050, and 0.125 mg/kg/day to rats showed no indications of increased carcinogenic risks. Based on pharmacokinetic data from a shorter term study in rats, the highest dose of 0.125 mg/kg/day was anticipated to give systemic exposure in the rat equivalent to 1.4 times the MRHD (based on AUC comparison).</p><p>A long-term study with topical application of up to 0.1% of tazarotene in a gel formulation in mice terminated at 88 weeks showed that dose levels of 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, and 1 mg/kg/day (reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day for males after 41 weeks due to severe dermal irritation) revealed no apparent carcinogenic effects when compared to vehicle control animals. Tazarotenic acid systemic exposures at the highest dose was 35 times the MRHD (based on AUC comparison).</p><p>Halobetasol propionate was not genotoxic in the Ames assay, in the sister chromatid exchange test in Chinese hamster somatic cells, in chromosome aberration studies of germinal and somatic cells of rodents, and in a mammalian spot test. Positive mutagenicity effects were observed in a mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay in vitro and in a Chinese hamster micronucleus test.</p><p>Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the Ames assay and did not produce structural chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes. Tazarotene was non-mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay and was non-clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test.</p><p>Studies in rats following oral administration of halobetasol propionate at dose levels up to 0.05 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.53 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons, indicated no impairment of fertility or general reproductive performance.</p><p>No impairment of fertility occurred in rats when male animals were treated for 70 days prior to mating and female animals were treated for 14 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation with topical doses of a tazarotene gel formulation up to 0.125 mg/kg/day. Based on data from another study, the systemic drug exposure in the rat at the highest dose was 5 times the MRHD (based on AUC comparison).</p><p>No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in male rats treated for 70 days prior to mating with oral doses of up to 1 mg/kg/day tazarotene, which produced a systemic exposure 17 times the MRHD (based on AUC comparison).</p><p>No impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed in female rats treated for 15 days prior to mating and continuing through gestation day 7 with oral doses of tazarotene up to 2 mg/kg/day. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of estrous stages and an increase in developmental effects at that dose, which produced a systemic exposure 30 times the MRHD (based on AUC comparison).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of once daily use of Duobrii Lotion for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were assessed in two prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trials (Trial 1 [NCT02462070] and Trial 2 [NCT02462122]). These trials were conducted in 418 subjects 18 years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis that covered a body surface area (BSA) between 3% and 12% excluding the face, scalp, palms, soles, axillae, and intertriginous areas. Disease severity was determined by a 5-grade Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA). Subjects applied Duobrii Lotion or vehicle to all affected areas once daily for up to 8 weeks. All subjects returned for a 4-week follow-up visit (Week 12 visit) where safety and efficacy were evaluated.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with “treatment success” at Week 8. Treatment success was defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline in the IGA score and an IGA score equating to “clear” or “almost clear”. Table 3 lists the primary efficacy results for Trials 1 and 2. The secondary efficacy endpoints evaluated treatment success sequentially at Weeks 12, 6, 4, and 2.
