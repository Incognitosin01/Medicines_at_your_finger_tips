It is used to treat some kinds of cancer as well as some noncancerous conditions.</p><p>Mechlorethamine interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by mechlorethamine, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur for months or years after the medicine is used.</p><p>Before you begin treatment with mechlorethamine, you and your doctor should talk about the good mechlorethamine will do as well as the risks of using it.</p><p>Mechlorethamine is to be administered only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using mechlorethamine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Although there is no specific information comparing use of mechlorethamine in children with use in other age groups, it is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people.

If you are using a combination of medicines, it is important that you receive each one at the proper time. If you are taking some of these medicines by mouth, ask your health care professional to help you plan a way to take them at the right times.</p><p>While you are using mechlorethamine, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids so that you will pass more urine.

Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using mechlorethamine</h2><p>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that mechlorethamine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>While you are being treated with mechlorethamine, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Mechlorethamine may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have taken oral polio vaccine. Do not get close to them, and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.</p><p>Mechlorethamine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; blood in urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>If mechlorethamine accidentally seeps out of the vein into which it is injected, it may damage some tissues and cause scarring. Tell the health care professional right away if you notice redness, pain, or swelling at the place of injection.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Mechlorethamine side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>Also, because of the way cancer medicines act on the body, there is a chance that they might cause other effects that may not occur until months or years after these medicines are used. These delayed effects may include certain types of cancer.
