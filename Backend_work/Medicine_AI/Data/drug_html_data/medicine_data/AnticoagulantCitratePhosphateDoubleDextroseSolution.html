</ul><p class="First">Products: Anticoagulant Citrate Phosphate Double Dextrose (CP2D)<br/>
and Additive Solution Formula 3 (AS-3)</p><p>Company:<br/>
Haemonetics Corporation<br/>
400 Wood Road<br/>
Braintree, MA 02184</p><h2>I. Indications for Use</h2><p class="First">The Haemonetics 250mL Anticoagulant Citrate Phosphate Double Dextrose (CP2D)<br/>
and 250mL Additive Solution Formula 3 (AS-3) nutrient solution are intended to be<br/>
used only with automated apheresis devices for collecting human blood and blood<br/>
components. The anticoagulant solution is metered by the apheresis machine into<br/>
the collected whole blood. It is not to be infused directly into the donor. After the<br/>
anticoagulant is used, the bag in which it was contained is discarded. When<br/>
collecting plasma in the RBCP protocol, the plasma is collected into an empty plasma<br/>
collection bag. One hundred milliliters (100ml) of AS-3 is transferred into one RBC<br/>
collection bag when using the RBCP protocol or 2 separate bags when using the<br/>
2RBC protocol. AS-3 solution provides nutrients to keep the red blood cells viable for<br/>
42 days when refrigerated.</p><p>CP2D is also indicated for the collection of FFP and PF24 plasma, collected and<br/>
stored plasma collected using the 822, 822-2P and 822F-2P disposable sets may be<br/>
frozen within 8 hours (FFP) or within 24 hours which includes 8 hours room<br/>
temperature storage and 16 hours refrigeration storage (PF24).</p><p>The 300mL AS-3 is used in conjunction with automated red blood cell washing<br/>
devices. AS-3 serves as the nutrient solution for storage of the red blood cell product<br/>
after deglycerolization. The red blood cells are washed using the Model 215 System.<br/>
AS-3 is used for priming the disposable and for the last wash of the red blood cells.<br/>
The washed cells are then re-suspended in 100mL of the AS-3 before transfer into a<br/>
product collection bag or storage bag. Additive Solution Formula 3 (AS-3) provides<br/>
nutrients to keep the washed red blood cells viable for up to 14 days after washing<br/>
when refrigerated.</p><p>Neither the CP2D nor the AS-3 container is used for the storage of blood or blood<br/>
components.</p><h2>Dosage Form</h2><p class="First">The container for all CP2D and AS-3 solutions is a flexible polyvinyl chloride (PVC)<br/>
bag sized for holding the appropriate amount of solution. The bag has a single port<br/>
that is used for bag filling. The port is sealed after filling with a male luer assembly<br/>
(CP2D) or female luer assembly (AS-3). Both the male and female luers are gamma<br/>
irradiated prior to use. The plastic bag is contained in an overwrap which is added<br/>
prior to sterilization.</p><p>The formulations for these products are as follows:</p><p><span class="Bold">Citrate Phosphate Double Dextrose Solution (CP2D)</span><br/>

Corporation Union, South Carolina facility included <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> survival data in healthy<br/>
subjects at one test site and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> characterization of stored red blood cells at<br/>
three test sites.</p><p>Haemonetics Clinical Evaluation #95012, involved autologous in vivo recovery and<br/>
survival studies, and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> red blood cell characterization conducted at a single<br/>
site. RBC results collected with Haemonetics CP2D/AS-3 were compared to crossover<br/>
controls of manually collected RBCs from the same donors using CP2D/AS-3 made by<br/>
Medsep Corporation (crossover manual controls). In addition, results were<br/>
compared to data from other RBC apheresis donors using CP2D/AS-3 solutions<br/>
manufactured by MedSep (unmatched apheresis controls). Test parameters included<br/>
hematocrit, hemoglobin, RBC and WBC counts, ATP levels, pH, supernatant<br/>
potassium, free hemoglobin, supernatant glucose levels, and product weight. The<br/>
RBC quality of test units after 42-day storage was equivalent or slightly superior to<br/>
those of the control units. RBCs collected by the two different collection protocols<br/>
(Red Blood Cells with or without Plasma) showed no significant differences in terms<br/>
of RBC quality and red blood cells from all groups met FDA and AABB guidelines for<br/>
24-hour recovering at 42 days storage.</p><p>Study #98001 was performed using 250mL CP2D and 250mL AS-3 to confirm, <span class="Italics">in</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">vitro</span>, the results of Clinical Evaluation #95012. Three test sites each performed three<br/>
RBCP and three 2RBC apheresis procedures using the MCS+ LN8150 and associated<br/>
collection sets. In addition, each site collected six manual whole blood units as<br/>
concurrent (unmatched) controls using Medsep sets and prepared RBCs according to<br/>
standard procedures.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> tests of red blood cell functional and physical integrity were conducted at<br/>
Days 0 and 42 of storage. All plasma units from the RBCP and manual procedures<br/>
were evaluated on Day 0 for <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> product characteristics. Group t-tests (two<br/>
tailed) were performed to examine any statistically significant differences between<br/>
the properties of apheresis and manual RBCs. Statistically significant differences<br/>
(p&lt;n; 0.05) were evaluated in terms of clinical significance. Differences in glucose or<br/>
lactate levels, hematocrit, pH, and supernatant potassium were not considered<br/>
clinically relevant because these parameters have not been found to correlate<br/>
significantly with the in vivo 24 hour percent recovery.</p><p>The results from this study confirmed the observations from Clinical Evaluation<br/>
#95012. The quality of stored RBC products collected by apheresis is similar to RBC<br/>
products collected manually. A difference in ATP and hemolysis levels, both after<br/>
processing and on day 42 of storage, for the apheresis units were not statistically<br/>
significant when compared to ATP and hemolysis levels from manually collected<br/>
RBCs and were similar to historicai reference values.</p><p>AS-3 300ml was used in conjunction with an automated closed system, the<br/>
Haemonetics Model 215 (now called the ACP) in Clinical Evaluation #97002. Five test<br/>
sites were used in this study. 100 samples were tested <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and 30 <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>. Red<br/>
blood cells derived from CPDA-1 whole blood units were used. AS-1 red blood cells<br/>
were used as a control. A total of 140 red blood cell units were glycerolized and<br/>
deglycerolized. The <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> RBC quality and in vivo RBC viability data obtained on<br/>
these units demonstrate that red cell units glycerolized and deglycerolized using the<br/>
Model 215 System and resuspended in 300ml AS-3 solution manufactured by<br/>
Haemonetics, Union, South Carolina are processed in a closed system and can be<br/>
stored for 15 days at 4Â°C.</p><p>Clinical report TR-CLN-100229-A was conducted to support the use of CP2D for the<br/>
collection of FFP and PF24 {plasma collected and stored Plasma collected using the<br/>
822, 822-2P and 822F-2P disposable sets may be frozen within 8 hours (FFP) or<br/>

The outlier pair was excluded from the analysis based on the statistical criteria or laboratory errors.</p><p>One sample (Plasma Sample A) showed significantly increased levels for Factor VIIa and F1.2. Another sample (Plasma Sample B) showed significantly decreased level of Factor VIII:C for the FFP sample (Table 2). These data were excluded from Table 1 since the values for VIIa and F1.2 were more than 4 SD from the mean. The factor VIII:C was not more than 4 SD from the mean but was significantly lower in FFP as compared to PF24. While other parameters in this sample did not show significant differences when compared to the control FFP, the FDA could not exclude the possibility that the activation found in the PF24 sample was related to the preparation procedure. The rate of such event occurrence was unknown and, based on review of published values for PF24 products, is most likely very rare. The clinical significance of the elevated markers of clotting activation for transfusion recipients is undetermined.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FFP</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Max</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PF24</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Min</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PF24</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Max</span></p><p class="First">220</p><p class="First"> Thrombin-Antithrombin Complex</p><p>(ng/mL)</p><p><span class="Bold">Note:</span> Plasma collected may be labeled as FFP or Plasma Frozen within 24 Hours (PF24).</p><p><span class="Bold">Note:</span> For FFP, the plasma should be placed in a freezer within 8 hours from the completion of collection.

<span class="Bold">Precautions for use:</span><br/>
â¢ Solutions are NOT INTENDED FOR DIRECT INFUSION.<br/>
â¢ Do not use if particulate matter is present or if the solution is cloudy<br/>
<span class="Italics">Note:</span> Some opacity of the plastic container due to moisture absorbance by<br/>
the PVC during the sterilization process may be observed. This is normal and<br/>
does not affect the quality or the safety of the product. This white, hazy<br/>
appearance will diminish gradually over time. This advice only applies to the<br/>
plastic container. Do not use if the solution itself is cloudy or contains<br/>
particulate matter.<br/>
â¢Do not use if the container is damaged, leaking or if there is any visible sign<br/>
of deterioration.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Note:</span> The over wrap serves as a moisture barrier. Upon removing the<br/>
solution bag, small droplets of condensation may be present in the<br/>
packaging. This is considered normal. After removing the over wrap gently<br/>
squeeze the inner bag which protects the sterility of the solution. Discard if<br/>
any leaks are observed or if an excessive amount of solution is noted within<br/>
the over wrap.<br/>
â¢ Do not reuse solution. Discard any unused or partially used solutions.<br/>
â¢ Protect from sharp objects.<br/>
â¢ Verify that solutions have been appropriately connected to avoid leaks.<br/>
â¢ The set should be loaded and primed for use within 8 hours of the start of the collection.<br/>
â¢ Carry out the apheresis procedure in accordance with the detailed<br/>
instructions of the manufacturer of the apheresis device.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions:</h2><p class="First">Donors being reinfused with citrated blood or blood components may experience<br/>
side effects due to the presence of citrate. Patients being transfused with the blood<br/>
components could also experience a reaction to the citrated blood components.<br/>
The major symptom experienced by donors is paraesthesia. Should this occur the<br/>
reinfusion should be stopped or the reinfusion rate decreased. In the event of<br/>
inadvertent bolus of the product administer calcium gluconate.</p><h2>Drug Abuse / Dependence:</h2><p class="First">Both solutions are intended to be used only with automated apheresis devices for<br/>
