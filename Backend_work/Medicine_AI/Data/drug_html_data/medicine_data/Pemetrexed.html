Keep using birth control for at least 3 months after your last dose.</p><p>Tell your doctor right away if a pregnancy occurs while either the mother or the father is using pemetrexed.</p><p>This medicine may affect fertility (ability to have children) in men. However, it is important to use birth control to prevent pregnancy because pemetrexed can harm an unborn baby.</p><p>You should not breastfeed while you are using pemetrexed, and for at least 1 week after your last dose.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is pemetrexed given?</h2><p>Pemetrexed is given as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>Pemetrexed is usually given every 3 weeks. Your doctor will determine how many treatment cycles you should receive.</p><p>To prevent certain side effects of pemetrexed, you will need to take folic acid supplements and receive vitamin B12 injections (starting 7 days before your first dose of pemetrexed). Take only the amount of folic acid that your doctor has prescribed.</p><p>Your doctor may also prescribe steroid medication to reduce certain side effects of pemetrexed. Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully.</p><p>Call your doctor if you are sick with vomiting or diarrhea, or if you are sweating more than usual. You can easily become dehydrated while taking pemetrexed. This can lead to very low blood pressure, a serious electrolyte imbalance, or kidney failure.</p><p>Pemetrexed can lower blood cells that help your body fight infections and help your blood to clot. Your blood will need to be tested often. Your cancer treatments may be delayed based on the results of these tests.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss an appointment for your pemetrexed injection.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while receiving pemetrexed?</h2><p><b>If you have kidney disease,</b> avoid taking ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) for 2 days before or 2 days after you are treated with pemetrexed.</p><p>Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections.

Use extra care to prevent bleeding while shaving or brushing your teeth.</p><p>Do not receive a "live" vaccine while using pemetrexed, and avoid coming into contact with anyone who has recently received a live vaccine.
