This medicine is not a cure for HIV or AIDS.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Sustiva if you also take elbasvir and grazoprevir (Zepatier) to treat hepatitis C.</p><p>Sustiva may cause serious psychiatric symptoms including confusion, severe depression, suicidal thoughts, aggression, extreme fear, hallucinations, or unusual behavior. Contact your doctor at once if you have any of these side effects, even if you have had them before.</p><p>Do not use efavirenz without telling your doctor if you are pregnant. It could harm the unborn baby. Use two forms of birth control, including a barrier form (such as a condom or diaphragm with spermicide gel) while you are taking this medicine, and for at least 12 weeks after your treatment ends. Tell your doctor if you become pregnant during treatment.</p><p>Taking Sustiva will not prevent you from passing HIV to other people. Talk with your doctor about safe methods of preventing HIV transmission during sex. Sharing drug or medicine needles is never safe, even for a healthy person.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Sustiva if you are allergic to efavirenz, or if you also take elbasvir and grazoprevir (Zepatier) to treat hepatitis C.</p><p>Do not take with Atripla (combination efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), unless your doctor tells you to.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Use 2 forms of birth control, including a barrier form (condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, or contraceptive sponge) to prevent pregnancy while you are using this medicine and for at least 12 weeks after your last dose. <b>Tell your doctor if you become pregnant during treatment.</b></p><p><b>Hormonal contraception</b> (birth control pills, injections, implants, skin patches, and vaginal rings) <b>may not be effective enough to prevent pregnancy while you are taking Sustiva.</b></p><p>HIV can be passed to your baby if the virus is not controlled during pregnancy. Your name may be listed on a registry to track any effects of antiviral medicine on the baby.</p><p>Women with HIV or AIDS should not breast-feed a baby. Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk.</p><h2>How should I take Sustiva?</h2><p>Take Sustiva exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p><b>Sustiva must be given in combination with other antiviral medications and it should not be used alone.</b> Your disease may become resistant to efavirenz if you do not take it in combination with other HIV medicines your doctor has prescribed.</p><p>Take Sustiva on an empty stomach at bedtime.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Swallow the <b>tablet</b> whole and do not crush, chew, or break it.</p><p>If you cannot swallow a capsule whole, open it and sprinkle the medicine into a spoonful of applesauce, yogurt, grape jelly, or infant formula (if you are giving the medicine to a baby). Swallow the mixture right away. Do not save it for later use.</p><p>After taking Sustiva using the sprinkle method, do not eat for the next 2 hours.

Your child's dose needs may change if the child gains or loses weight.</p><p>You will need frequent medical tests.</p><p>Take Sustiva regularly to get the most benefit. Skipping doses may increase the risk of your virus becoming resistant to antiviral medicine.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>This medicine may affect a drug-screening urine test and you may have false results.
