</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for this Medicine</h2><p>Inhalation corticosteroids are cortisone-like medicines. They are used to help prevent the symptoms of asthma. When used regularly every day, inhalation corticosteroids decrease the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, they will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.</p><p>Inhaled corticosteroids work by preventing certain cells in the lungs and breathing passages from releasing substances that cause asthma symptoms.</p><p>This medicine may be used with other asthma medicines, such as bronchodilators (medicines that open up narrowed breathing passages) or other corticosteroids taken by mouth.</p><p>Inhalation corticosteroids are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using this Medicine</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Inhalation corticosteroids have been tested in children and, except for the possibility of slowed growth, in low effective doses, have not been shown to cause different side effects or problems than they do in adults.</p><p>Studies have shown that slowed growth or reduced adrenal gland function may occur in some children using inhaled corticosteroids in recommended doses. However, poorly controlled asthma may cause slowed growth, especially when corticosteroids taken by mouth are needed. Your doctor will want you to use the lowest possible dose of an inhaled corticosteroid that will control the asthma. This will lessen the chance of an effect on growth or adrenal gland function. <i>It is also important that children taking inhaled corticosteroids visit their doctors regularly so that their growth rates may be monitored.</i></p><p>Regular use of inhaled corticosteroids may allow some children to stop using or decrease the amount of corticosteroids taken by mouth. This also will reduce the risk of slowed growth or reduced adrenal function.</p><p>Children who are using inhaled corticosteroids in large doses should avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. When a child is exposed or the disease develops, the doctor should be contacted and his or her directions should be followed carefully.</p><p>Before this medicine is given to a child, you and your child's doctor should talk about the good this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it. Follow the doctor's directions very carefully to lessen the chance that unwanted effects will occur.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of inhaled corticosteroids have not been performed in the geriatric population. However, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Although studies in animals have shown that inhaled corticosteroids cause birth defects and other problems, in humans these medicines, when used in regular daily doses during pregnancy to keep the mother's asthma under control, have not been reported to cause breathing problems or birth defects in the newborn. Also, corticosteroids may prevent the effects of poorly controlled asthma, which are known to be harmful to the baby. Before taking an inhaled corticosteroid, make sure your doctor knows if you are pregnant or if you may become pregnant.</p><h3>Breast Feeding</h3><p>It is not known whether inhaled corticosteroids pass into breast milk. Although most medicines pass into breast milk in small amounts, many of them may be used safely while breast-feeding. Mothers who are using this medicine and who wish to breast-feed should discuss this with their doctor.</p><h3>Interactions with Medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with Food/Tobacco/Alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other Medical Problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Asthma attack, acute (e.g., status asthmaticus)—Triamcinolone should not be used in patients with this condition.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Cirrhosis (liver disease)—The effect of inhaled corticosteroids may be stronger in patients with this disease</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Glaucoma—Use with caution. May increase the pressure in the eye.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Hypothyroidism (decreased production of thyroid hormone)—The effect of inhaled corticosteroids may be stronger in patients with this condition.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Infections, untreated (bacteria, fungal, or viral)—Use with caution. May make this condition worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Osteoporosis (bone disease)—Inhaled corticosteroids in high doses may make this condition worse in women who are past menopause and who are not receiving an estrogen replacement.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Tuberculosis, history of—Use of this medicine may cause a tuberculosis infection to occur again.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of this Medicine</h2><p><i>Inhaled corticosteroids will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started. However, your doctor may want you to continue taking this medicine at the usual time, even if you use another medicine to relieve the asthma attack.</i></p><p><i>Use this medicine only as directed. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects. Do not stop taking this medicine abruptly. This medicine should be discontinued only under the supervision of your doctor.</i></p><p><i>In order for this medicine to help prevent asthma attacks, it must be used every day in regularly spaced doses, as ordered by your doctor</i>. Up to 4 to 6 weeks may pass before you begin to notice improvement in your condition. It may take several months before you feel the full effects of this medicine. This may not take as long if you have already been taking certain other medicines for your asthma.</p><p>Gargling and rinsing your mouth with water after each dose may help prevent hoarseness, throat irritation, and infection in the mouth. However, do not swallow the water after rinsing. Your doctor may also want you to use a spacer device to lessen these problems.</p><p>Inhaled corticosteroids are used with a special inhaler and usually come with patient directions. <i>Read the directions carefully before using this medicine</i>. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your health care professional to show you what to do. Also, <i>ask your health care professional to watch how you use the inhaler to make sure you are using it properly</i>.</p><p>For patients using <i>beclomethasone, flunisolide, or triamcinolone inhalation aerosol</i>:</p><ul>
<li>When you use the inhaler for the first time, or if you have not used it in a while, it may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first puff. So, before using the inhaler, test or prime it.</li>
<li>To test or prime most inhalers:
<ul>
<li>Insert the metal canister firmly into the clean mouthpiece according to the manufacturer's instructions. Check to make sure the canister is placed properly into the mouthpiece.</li>
<li>Take the cover off the mouthpiece and shake the inhaler three or four times.</li>
<li>Hold the inhaler well away from you at arm's length and press the top of the canister, spraying the medicine into the air two times. The inhaler will now be ready to provide the right amount of medicine when you use it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To use most inhalers:
<ul>
<li>Using your thumb and one or two fingers, hold the inhaler upright with the mouthpiece end down and pointing toward you.</li>
<li>Take the cover off the mouthpiece. Check the mouthpiece and remove any foreign objects. Then gently shake the inhaler three or four times.</li>
<li>Hold the mouthpiece away from your mouth and breathe out slowly to the end of a normal breath.</li>
<li>Use the inhalation method recommended by your doctor:
<ul>
<li>Open-mouth method—Place the mouthpiece about 1 or 2 inches (2 finger widths) in front of your widely opened mouth. Make sure the inhaler is aimed into your mouth so that the spray does not hit the roof of your mouth or your tongue.</li>
<li>Closed-mouth method—Place the mouthpiece in your mouth between your teeth and over your tongue with your lips closed tightly around it. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start to breathe in slowly through your mouth and, at the same time, press the top of the canister one time to get 1 puff of medicine. Continue to breathe in slowly for 3 to 5 seconds. Count the seconds while inhaling. It is important to press the top of the canister and breathe in slowly at the same time so the medicine gets into your lungs. This step may be difficult at first. If you are using the closed-mouth method and you see a fine mist coming from your mouth or nose, the inhaler is not being used correctly.</li>
<li>Hold your breath as long as you can up to 10 seconds. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs.</li>
<li>Take the mouthpiece away from your mouth and breathe out slowly.</li>
<li>If your doctor has told you to inhale more than 1 puff of medicine at each dose, gently shake the inhaler again, and take the next puff, following exactly the same steps you used for the first puff. Press the canister one time for each puff of medicine.</li>
<li>When you are finished, wipe off the mouthpiece and replace the cap.</li>
<li>Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist may want you to use a spacer device with the inhaler. A spacer helps get the medicine into the lungs and reduces the amount of medicine that stays in your mouth and throat.
<ul>
<li>To use a spacer device with the inhaler:
<ul>
<li>Attach the spacer to the inhaler according to the manufacturer's directions. There are different types of spacers available, but the method of breathing remains the same with most spacers.</li>
<li>Gently shake the inhaler and spacer three or four times.</li>
<li>Hold the mouthpiece of the spacer away from your mouth and breathe out slowly to the end of a normal breath.</li>
<li>Place the mouthpiece into your mouth between your teeth and over your tongue with your lips closed around it.</li>
<li>Press down on the canister top once to release 1 puff of medicine into the spacer. Within one or two seconds, start to breathe in slowly through your mouth for 3 to 5 seconds. Count the seconds while inhaling. Do not breathe in through your nose.</li>
<li>Hold your breath as long as you can up to 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Breathe out slowly. Do not remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Breathe in and out slowly two or three times to make sure the spacer device is emptied.</li>
<li>If your doctor has told you to take more than 1 puff of medicine at each dose, gently shake the inhaler and spacer again and take the next puff, following exactly the same steps you used for the first puff. Do not spray more than 1 puff at a time into the spacer.</li>
<li>When you are finished, remove the spacer device from the inhaler and replace the cover of the mouthpiece.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clean the inhaler mouthpiece, and spacer at least once a week.
<ul>
<li>To clean the inhaler:
<ul>
<li>Remove the canister from the inhaler and set the canister aside.</li>
<li>Wash the mouthpiece, cap, and spacer with warm, soapy water. Then, rinse well with warm, running water.</li>
<li>Shake off the excess water and let the inhaler parts air-dry completely before putting the inhaler back together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check with your pharmacist to see if you should save the inhaler piece that comes with this medicine after the medicine is used up. Refill units may be available at a lower cost. However, remember that the inhaler is meant to be used only for the medicine that comes with it. Do not use the inhaler for any other inhalation aerosol medicine, even if the cartridge fits.</li>

<li>To load the inhaler:
<ul>
<li>Make sure your hands are clean and dry.</li>
<li>Do not insert the cartridge until just before you are ready to use this medicine.</li>
<li>Take off the dark brown mouthpiece cover and make sure the mouthpiece is clean.</li>
<li>Hold the white cartridge by the exposed corners and gently pull it out until you see the ribbed sides of the cartridge.</li>
<li>Squeeze the ribbed sides and take out the cartridge unit from the body of the inhaler.</li>
<li>Place the disk containing the medicine onto the white wheel with the numbers facing up. Allow the underside of the disk to fit into the holes of the wheel.</li>
<li>Slide the cartridge unit with wheel and disk back into the body of the inhaler. Gently push the cartridge in and pull it out again. The disk will turn.</li>
<li>Continue to turn the disk in this way until the number 8 appears in the side indicator window. Each disk has eight blisters containing the medicine. The window will display how many doses you have left after you use it each time, by counting down from 8. For example, when you see the number 1, you have one dose left.</li>
<li>To replace the empty disk with a full disk, follow the same steps you used to load the inhaler. Do not throw away the wheel when you discard the empty disk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To use the inhaler:
<ul>
<li>Hold the inhaler flat in your hand. Lift the rear edge of the lid until it is fully upright.</li>
<li>The plastic needle on the front of the lid will break the blister containing one inhalation of medicine. When the lid is raised as far as it will go, both the upper and the lower surfaces of the blister will be pierced. Do not lift the lid if the cartridge is not in the inhaler. Doing this will break the needle and you will need a new inhaler.</li>
<li>Raise the inhaler to your mouth, and place the mouthpiece in your mouth.</li>
<li>Close your lips around the mouthpiece and tilt your head slightly back. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue. Do not cover the air holes on the side of the mouthpiece.</li>
<li>Breathe in through your mouth as fast as you can until you have taken a full deep breath.</li>
<li>Hold your breath and remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Continue holding your breath as long as you can up to 10 seconds before breathing out. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs.</li>
<li>Hold the inhaler well away from your mouth and breathe out to the end of a normal breath.</li>
<li>Prepare the cartridge for your next inhalation. Pull the cartridge out once and push it in once. The disk will turn to the next numbered dose as seen in the indicator window. Do not pierce the blister until just before the inhalation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To clean the inhaler:
<ul>
<li>Brush away the loose powder each day with the brush provided.</li>
<li>The inhaler should be replaced every 6 months.</li>

The window will display how many doses you have left after you use it each time, by counting down from 8. For example, when you see the number 1, you have one dose left.</li>
<li>To replace the empty disk with a full disk, follow the same steps you used to load the inhaler. Do not throw away the wheel when you discard the empty disk.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Hold the inhaler flat in your hand. Lift the rear edge of the lid until it is fully upright.</li>
<li>The plastic needle on the front of the lid will break the blister containing one inhalation of medicine. When the lid is raised as far as it will go, both the upper and the lower surfaces of the blister will be pierced. Do not lift the lid if the cartridge is not in the inhaler. Doing this will break the needle and you will need a new inhaler.</li>
<li>Raise the inhaler to your mouth, and place the mouthpiece in your mouth.</li>
<li>Close your lips around the mouthpiece and tilt your head slightly back. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue. Do not cover the air holes on the side of the mouthpiece.</li>
<li>Breathe in through your mouth as fast as you can until you have taken a full deep breath.</li>
<li>Hold your breath and remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Continue holding your breath as long as you can up to 10 seconds before breathing out. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs.</li>
<li>Hold the inhaler well away from your mouth and breathe out to the end of a normal breath.</li>
<li>Prepare the cartridge for your next inhalation. Pull the cartridge out once and push it in once. The disk will turn to the next numbered dose as seen in the indicator window. Do not pierce the blister until just before the inhalation.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Brush away the loose powder each day with the brush provided.</li>
<li>The inhaler should be replaced every 6 months.</li>

<li>To prime the inhaler:
<ul>
<li>Unscrew the cover of the inhaler and lift it off.</li>
<li>Hold the inhaler upright with the brown piece pointing downward. Turn the brown piece of the inhaler in one direction as far as it will go. Then twist it back until it clicks. Repeat this step one more time and the inhaler will be primed.</li>
<li>Prime each new inhaler before using it the first time. After it has been primed, it is not necessary to prime it again, even if you put it aside for a long period of time</li>
