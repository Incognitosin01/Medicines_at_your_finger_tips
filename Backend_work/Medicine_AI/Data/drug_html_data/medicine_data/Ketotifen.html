It may also lead to a reduction in daily requirements of other antiasthma medications. Ketotifen is not effective for the prevention or treatment of acute asthma attacks. Ketotifen works by inhibiting certain substances in the body that are known to cause inflammation and symptoms of asthma.</p><p>Ketotifen is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using ketotifen</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For ketotifen, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to ketotifen or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Ketotifen has been tested in children and, in effective doses, has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems than it does in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of ketotifen in the elderly with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking ketotifen, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using ketotifen with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>
<li>Amifampridine</li>
<li>Bupropion</li>
<li>Donepezil</li>
<li>Pitolisant</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of ketotifen. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes)—May alter low-sugar diet (syrup contains carbohydrates)</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Epilepsy—May increase risk of convulsions (seizures)</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of ketotifen</h2><p>Make certain your health care professional knows if you are on any special diet, such as a low-sugar diet. The syrup contains carbohydrates.</p><p>Ketotifen is used to help prevent asthma attacks. It will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.</p><p>Ketotifen must be taken continuously in order to be effective.</p><p>Continue taking your current asthma medications until instructed otherwise by your doctor.</p><p>Ketotifen may be taken with or without food.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of ketotifen will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of ketotifen. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
