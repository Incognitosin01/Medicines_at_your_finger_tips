</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Tydemy</h2><h3>Oral Contraceptive</h3><p class="First">Tydemy<span class="Sup">TM</span> is indicated for use by women to prevent pregnancy.</p><h3>Folate Supplementation</h3><p class="First">Tydemy is indicated in women who choose to use an oral contraceptive as their method of contraception, to raise folate levels for the purpose of reducing the risk of a neural tube defect in a pregnancy conceived while taking the product or shortly after discontinuing the product.</p><h2>Tydemy Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>How to Take Tydemy</h3><p class="First">Take one tablet by mouth at the same time every day. The failure rate may increase when pills are missed or taken incorrectly.</p><p>To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Tydemy must be taken as directed, in the order directed on the blister. Single missed pills should be taken as soon as remembered.</p><h3>How to Start Tydemy</h3><p class="First">Instruct the patient to begin taking Tydemy either on the first day of her menstrual period (Day 1 Start) or on the first Sunday after the onset of her menstrual period (Sunday Start).</p><p><span class="Italics">Day 1 Start</span></p><p>During the first cycle of Tydemy use, instruct the patient to take one orange Tydemy daily, beginning on Day 1 of her menstrual cycle. (The first day of menstruation is Day 1.) She should take one orange Tydemy daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one light orange tablet, containing levomefolate alone, daily on Days 22 through 28. Tydemy should be taken in the order directed on the package at the same time each day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime with some liquid, as needed. Tydemy can be taken without regard to meals. If Tydemy is first taken later than the first day of the menstrual cycle, Tydemy should not be considered effective as a contraceptive until after the first 7 consecutive days of product administration. Instruct the patient to use a non-hormonal contraceptive as back-up during the first 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.</p><p><span class="Italics">Sunday Start</span></p><p>During the first cycle of Tydemy use, instruct the patient to take one orange Tydemy daily, beginning on the first Sunday after the onset of her menstrual period. She should take one orange Tydemy daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one light orange tablet, containing levomefolate alone, daily on Days 22 through 28. Tydemy should be taken in the order directed on the package at the same time each day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime with some liquid, as needed. Tydemy can be taken without regard to meals. Tydemy should not be considered effective as a contraceptive until after the first 7 consecutive days of product administration. Instruct the patient to use a non-hormonal contraceptive as back-up during the first 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.</p><p>The patient should begin her next and all subsequent 28-day regimens of Tydemy on the same day of the week that she began her first regimen, following the same schedule. She should begin taking her orange tablets on the next day after ingestion of the last light orange folate tablet, regardless of whether or not a menstrual period has occurred or is still in progress. Anytime a subsequent cycle of Tydemy is started later than the day following administration of the last light orange tablet, the patient should use another method of contraception until she has taken an orange Tydemy daily for seven consecutive days.</p><p><span class="Italics">When switching from a different birth control pill</span></p><p>When switching from another birth control pill, Tydemy should be started on the same day that a new pack of the previous oral contraceptive would have been started.</p><p><span class="Italics">When switching from a method other than a birth control pill</span></p><p>When switching from a transdermal patch or vaginal ring, Tydemy should be started when the next application would have been due. When switching from an injection, Tydemy should be started when the next dose would have been due. When switching from an intrauterine contraceptive or an implant, Tydemy should be started on the day of removal.</p><p>Withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within 3 days following the last orange tablet. If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs while taking Tydemy, instruct the patient to continue taking Tydemy by the regimen described above. Counsel her that this type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, advise her that if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, she should consult her healthcare provider.</p><p>Although the occurrence of pregnancy is low if Tydemy is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Discontinue Tydemy if pregnancy is confirmed.</p><p>The risk of pregnancy increases with each active orange tablet missed. For additional patient instructions regarding missed pills, see the <span class="Bold">"WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS"</span> section in the <span class="Bold">FDA-Approved Patient Labeling</span>. If breakthrough bleeding occurs following missed tablets, it will usually be transient and of no consequence. If the patient misses one or more light orange tablets, she should still be protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking a new cycle of orange tablets on the proper day.</p><p>For postpartum women who do not breastfeed or after a second trimester abortion, start Tydemy no earlier than 4 weeks postpartum due to the increased risk of thromboembolism. If the patient starts Tydemy postpartum and has not yet had a period, evaluate for possible pregnancy, and instruct her to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken Tydemy for 7 consecutive days.</p><h3>Advice in Case of Gastrointestinal Disturbances</h3><p class="First">In case of severe vomiting or diarrhea, absorption may not be complete and additional contraceptive measures should be taken. If vomiting occurs within 3 to 4 hours after tablet-taking, this can be regarded as a missed tablet.</p><h3>Folate Supplementation</h3><p class="First">The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women of childbearing age consume supplemental folic acid in a dose of at least 0.4 mg (400 mcg) daily.<span class="Sup">1</span>Consider other folate supplementation that a woman may be taking before prescribing Tydemy. Ensure that folate supplementation is maintained if a woman discontinues Tydemy due to pregnancy.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Tydemy (drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets) is available in blister containing 28 tablets packed in a pouch.

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems</h3><p class="First">Stop Tydemy if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs.</p><p>Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, Yasmin<span class="Sup">®</span>), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of Tydemy in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span><span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin<span class="Sup">®</span> (which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1.</p><p>In addition to these "regulatory studies," other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: VTE Risk with Yasmin<span class="Sup">®</span> Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk<span class="Sup">#</span>)</span></p><p></p><p>Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio &lt; 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, &gt; 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP.</p><p><span class="Sup">*</span>Comparator "Other COCs", including LNG- containing COCs</p><p><span class="Sup">†</span> LASS is an extension of the EURAS study</p><p><span class="Sup">#</span>Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site</p><p>(References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]<span class="Sup">2</span>, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]<span class="Sup">3</span>, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]<span class="Sup">4</span>, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]<span class="Sup">5</span>, Danish re-analysis [Lidegaard 2011]<span class="Sup">6</span>, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]<span class="Sup">7</span>, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]<span class="Sup">8</span>, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]<span class="Sup">9</span>, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]<span class="Sup">10</span>)</p><p>Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC.</p><p>The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.</p><p>Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE</span></p><p></p><p>If feasible, stop Tydemy at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism.</p><p>Start Tydemy no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.</p><p>Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events.</p><p>COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt;35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors.</p><p>Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.</p><p>Stop Tydemy if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6)].</span></p><h3>Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First">Tydemy contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Tydemy is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin–II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs</h3><p class="First">Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Tydemy because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor.</p><p>There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.</p><p>Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</p><h3>Liver Disease</h3><p class="First">Discontinue Tydemy if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded.</p><p>Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt; 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.</p><p>Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use.</p><h3>5.5 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue Tydemy prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Tydemy can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.</span></p><h3>High Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Tydemy if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs.</p><p>An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin.</p><h3>Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users.</p><h3>Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</h3><p class="First">Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Tydemy. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion.</p><p>Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.</p><p>Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.</p><h3>Headache</h3><p class="First">If a woman taking Tydemy develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Tydemy if indicated.</p><p>An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC.</p><h3>Bleeding Irregularities</h3><p class="First">Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.</p><p>Data from ten Yasmin<span class="Sup">®</span> contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took Yasmin<span class="Sup">®</span> and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 25 subjects out of 3,009 in the Yasmin<span class="Sup">®</span> and Tydemy trials (&lt;1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia.</p><p>The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86% to 88%) was 4 to 7 days. Women who use Tydemy may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from Yasmin<span class="Sup">®</span> contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2 to 13, 1 to 11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</p><p>If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.</p><h3>COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect when COCs are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned. Discontinue Tydemy if pregnancy is confirmed and initiate a prenatal vitamin containing folate supplementation.</p><p>The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><h3>Depression</h3><p class="First">Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Tydemy discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>.</p><p>DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity.</p><p>Folates may mask vitamin B12 deficiency.</p><h3>Monitoring</h3><p class="First">A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.</p><h3>Other Conditions</h3><p class="First">In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Italics">Contraception and Folate Supplementation Clinical Trials</span></p><p>The data provided reflect the experience with the use of Yasmin<span class="Sup">®</span> (3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE) in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=2,837) and folate supplementation (N=172). For contraception, the US pivotal clinical study (N=326) for the oral contraception indication for Yasmin<span class="Sup">®</span> was a multicenter, open-label trial in healthy women aged 18 to 35 who were treated with Yasmin<span class="Sup">®</span> for up to 13 cycles.

Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy.</p><p>The administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy. COCs should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.</p><p>Women who do not breastfeed may start COCs no earlier than four weeks postpartum.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">When possible, advise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception until she has weaned her child. Estrogen-containing COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well-established; however, it can occur at any time in some women. Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites are present in breast milk.</p><p>After oral administration of 3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE tablets (Yasmin<span class="Sup">®</span>), about 0.02% of the DRSP dose was excreted into the breast milk of postpartum women within 24 hours.

The pharmacodynamic effect on plasma folate, RBC folate, and the profile of circulating folate metabolites was assessed during 24 weeks of treatment with 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium or with 0.4 mg folic acid (equimolar dose to 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium), both in combination with 3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE (Yasmin<span class="Sup">®</span>) followed by 20 weeks of open-label treatment with Yasmin<span class="Sup">®</span> only (elimination phase) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>Tydemy and Yasmin<span class="Sup">®</span> are bioequivalent with respect to DRSP and EE.</p><p>The absolute bioavailability of DRSP from a single entity tablet is about 76%. The absolute bioavailability of EE is approximately 40% as a result of presystemic conjugation and first-pass metabolism. The absolute bioavailability of Tydemy, which is a combination tablet of DRSP and EE has not been evaluated. Serum concentrations of DRSP and EE reached peak levels within 1 to 2 hours after administration of Tydemy.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of DRSP are dose proportional following single doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg. Following daily dosing of Yasmin<span class="Sup">®</span>, steady state DRSP concentrations were observed after 8 days.

Mean baseline concentrations of about 15 nmol/L are reached in populations without folate food fortification under normal nutritional conditions. Orally administered levomefolate calcium is absorbed and is incorporated into the body folate pool. Peak plasma concentrations of about 50 nmol/L above baseline are reached within 0.5 to 1.5 hours after single oral administration of 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium.</p><p>Steady state conditions for total folate in plasma after intake of 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium are reached after about 8 to 16 weeks depending on the baseline levels. In red blood cells achievement of steady state is delayed due to the long life-span of red blood cells of about 120 days.</p><p class="First Footnote">NA- Not available<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Food Effect</span></p><p>The rate of absorption of DRSP and EE following single administration of a formulation similar to Tydemy was slower under fed (high fat meal) conditions with the serum C<span class="Sub">max</span> being reduced about 40% for both components. The extent of absorption of DRSP, however, remained unchanged. In contrast, the extent of absorption of EE was reduced by about 20% under fed conditions.</p><p>The effect of food on absorption of levomefolate calcium following administration of Tydemy has not been evaluated.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>DRSP and EE serum concentrations decline in two phases. The apparent volume of distribution of DRSP is approximately 4 L/kg and that of EE is reported to be approximately 4 to 5 L/kg.</p><p>DRSP does not bind to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) or corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) but binds about 97% to other serum proteins. Multiple dosing over 3 cycles resulted in no change in the free fraction (as measured at trough concentrations). EE is reported to be highly but non-specifically bound to serum albumin (approximately 98.5 %) and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of both SHBG and CBG. EE induced effects on SHBG and CBG were not affected by variation of the DRSP dosage in the range of 2 to 3 mg.</p><p>Biphasic kinetics is reported for folates with a fast- and a slow-turnover pool. The fast-turnover pool, probably reflecting newly absorbed folate, is consistent with the terminal half-life of approximately 4 to 5 hours after single oral administration of 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium. The slow-turnover pool reflecting turnover of folate polyglutamate has a mean residence time of greater than or equal to 100 days.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>The two main metabolites of DRSP found in human plasma were identified to be the acid form of DRSP generated by opening of the lactone ring and the 4,5-dihydrodrospirenone-3-sulfate, formed by reduction and subsequent sulfatation. These metabolites were shown not to be pharmacologically active. Drospirenone is also subject to oxidative metabolism catalyzed by CYP3A4.</p><p>EE has been reported to be subject to significant gut and hepatic first-pass metabolism. Metabolism of EE and its oxidative metabolites occur primarily by conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate. CYP3A4 in the liver is responsible for the 2-hydroxylation which is the major oxidative reaction. The 2-hydroxy metabolite is further transformed by methylation and glucuronidation prior to urinary and fecal excretion.</p><p>L-5-methyl-THF is the predominant folate transport form in blood under physiological conditions and during folic acid and levomefolate calcium administration.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>DRSP serum concentrations are characterized by a terminal disposition phase half-life of approximately 30 hours after both single and multiple dose regimens. Excretion of DRSP was nearly complete after ten days and amounts excreted were slightly higher in feces compared to urine. DRSP was extensively metabolized and only trace amounts of unchanged DRSP were excreted in urine and feces. At least 20 different metabolites were observed in urine and feces. About 38 to 47% of the metabolites in urine were glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In feces, about 17 to 20% of the metabolites were excreted as glucuronides and sulfates.</p><p>For EE the terminal disposition phase half-life has been reported to be approximately 24 hours. EE is not excreted unchanged. EE is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates and undergoes enterohepatic circulation.</p><p>L-5-methyl-THF is eliminated from the body by urinary excretion of intact folates and catabolic products as well as fecal excretion through a biphasic kinetics process.</p><p><span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Use</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">:</span></span> Safety and efficacy of Tydemy has been established in women of reproductive age.

They do not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.</p><p><span class="Bold">What Is Tydemy?</span></p><p>Tydemy is a birth control pill. It contains two female hormones, a synthetic estrogen called ethinyl estradiol and a progestin called drospirenone. Tydemy also contains levomefolate calcium, which is a B vitamin.</p><p>The progestin drospirenone may increase potassium. Therefore, you should not take Tydemy if you have kidney, liver or adrenal disease because this could cause serious heart and health problems. Other drugs may also increase potassium. If you are currently on daily, long-term treatment for a chronic condition with any of the medications below, you should consult your healthcare provider about whether Tydemy is right for you, and during the first month that you take Tydemy, you should have a blood test to check your potassium level.</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><p>Tydemy may also be taken by women who elect to use an oral contraceptive, to provide folate supplementation. It is recommended that women of reproductive age supplement their diet with 0.4 mg (400 mcg) of folic acid daily to lower their risk of having a pregnancy with a rare type of birth defect (known as a neural tube defect). The amount of folate contained in Tydemy supplements folate in the diet to lower this risk should you become pregnant while taking the drug or shortly after stopping it.</p><p><span class="Bold">How Well Does Tydemy Work?</span></p><p>Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your birth control pills. The better you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant.</p><p>Based on the results of two clinical studies, about 1 woman out of 100 women may get pregnant during the first year they use Tydemy.</p><p>The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant.</p><p><span class="Bold"></span></p><p><span class="Bold">How Do I Take</span> <span class="Bold">Tydemy?</span></p><p>1. <span class="Bold">Be sure to read these directions</span> before you start taking your pills or anytime you are not sure what to do.</p><p>2. The right way to take the pill is to take one pill every day at the same time in the order directed on the package. Preferably, take the pill after the evening meal or at bedtime, with some liquid, as needed. Tydemy can be taken without regard to meals.</p><p>If you miss pills you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. See "WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS" below.</p><p>3. Many women have spotting or light bleeding at unexpected times, or may feel sick to their stomach during the first 1 to 3 packs of pills.</p><p>If you do have spotting or light bleeding or feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If it does not go away, check with your healthcare provider.</p><p>4. Missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you make up these missed pills. On the days you take two pills, to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.</p><p>5. If you have vomiting (within 3 to 4 hours after you take your pill), you should follow the instructions for "WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS." If you have diarrhea or if you take certain medicines, including some antibiotics and some herbal products such as St. John's wort, your pills may not work as well.</p><p>Use a back-up method (such as condoms and spermicides) until you check with your healthcare provider.</p><p>6. If you have trouble remembering to take the pill, talk to your healthcare provider about how to make pill-taking easier or about using another method of birth control.</p><p>7<span class="Bold">. If you have any questions or are unsure about the information in this leaflet, call your healthcare provider.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Before You Start Taking Your Pills</span></p><p>1. Decide What Time of Day You Want to Take Your Pill</p><p>It is important to take Tydemy in the order directed on the package at the same time every day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime, with some liquid, as needed. Tydemy can be taken without regard to meals.</p><p>2. Look at Your Pill Pack (Blister) – It has 28 Pills</p><p>The Tydemy blister has <span class="Bold">21 orange pills</span> (with hormones and folate) to be taken for three weeks, followed by <span class="Bold">7 light orange pills</span> (without hormones, containing folate) to be taken for one week. <span class="Bold">It is important to take the light orange pills because they contain folate.</span></p><p>3. Also look for:</p><p>a) Where on the pack to start taking pills,</p><p>b) In what order to take the pills (follow the arrows)</p><p></p><p>4. Be sure you have ready at all times (a) another kind of birth control (such as condoms and spermicides) to use as a back-up in case you miss pills, and (b) an extra, full blister.</p><p><span class="Bold">When To Start the First Pack of Pills</span></p><p>You have a choice for which day to start taking your first pack of pills. Decide with your healthcare provider which is the best day for you. Pick a time of day which will be easy to remember.</p><p>Day 1 Start:</p><p>1. Take the first orange pill of the pack during the first 24 hours of your period.</p><p>2. You will not need to use a back-up method of birth control, because you are starting the Pill at the beginning of your period. However, if you start Tydemy later than the first day of your period, you should use another method of birth control (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up method until you have taken 7 orange pills.</p><p>Sunday Start:</p><p>1. Take the first orange pill of the pack on the Sunday after your period starts, even if you are still bleeding. If your period begins on Sunday, start the pack that same day.</p><p>2. Use another method of birth control (such as a condom and spermicide) as a back-up method if you have sex anytime from the Sunday you start your first pack until the next Sunday (7 days). This also applies if you start Tydemy after having been pregnant and you have not had a period since your pregnancy.</p><p><span class="Bold">When You Switch From a Different Birth Control Pill</span></p><p>When switching from another birth control pill, Tydemy should be started on the same day that a new pack of the previous birth control pill would have been started.</p><p><span class="Bold">When You Switch From Another Type of Birth Control Method</span></p><p>When switching from a transdermal patch or vaginal ring, Tydemy should be started when the next application would have been due. When switching from an injection, Tydemy should be started when the next dose would have been due. When switching from an intrauterine contraceptive or an implant, Tydemy should be started on the day of removal.</p><p><span class="Bold">What to Do During the Month</span></p><p>1. Take one pill at the same time every day until the pack is empty.</p><p>Do not skip pills even if you are spotting or bleeding between monthly periods or feel sick to your stomach (nausea).</p><p>Do not skip pills even if you do not have sex very often.</p><p>2.

<li>Think you are pregnant</li>
<li>Miss one period and have not taken your birth control pills on time every day</li>
<li>Miss two periods in a row</li>
</ul><p>Birth control pills should not be taken during pregnancy. However, birth control pills taken by accident during pregnancy are not known to cause birth defects.</p><p>Due to an increased risk of blood clots, you should stop Tydemy at least four weeks before you have major surgery and not restart it until at least two weeks after the surgery.</p><p>If you are breastfeeding, consider another birth control method until you are ready to stop breastfeeding. Birth control pills that contain estrogen, like Tydemy, may decrease the amount of milk you make. A small amount of the pill's hormones pass into breast milk.</p><p>Folates may make certain drugs, including some used for epilepsy, less effective, so talk to your healthcare provider about any medicines you take.</p><p>If you have vomiting or diarrhea, your birth control pills may not work as well. Take another pill if you vomit within 3 to 4 hours after taking your pill, or use another birth control method, like condoms and a spermicide, until you check with your healthcare provider.</p><p>If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your doctor you are taking birth-control pills.

This increased risk is highest when you first start taking birth control pills and when you restart the same or different birth control pills after not using them for a month or more. Women who use birth control pills with drospirenone (like Tydemy) may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot. Some studies reported that the risk of blood clots was higher for women who use birth control pills that contain drospirenone than for women who use birth control pills that do not contain drospirenone.</p><p><span class="Bold">Talk with your healthcare provider about your risk of getting a blood clot before deciding which birth control pill is right for you.</span></p><p>It is possible to die or be permanently disabled from a problem caused by a blood clot, such as a heart attack or a stroke. Some examples of serious clots are blood clots in the:</p><ul class="Disc">

<li>Lungs (pulmonary embolus or PE)</li>
<li>Eyes (loss of eyesight)</li>
<li>Heart (heart attack)</li>
<li>Brain (stroke)</li>
</ul><p>To put the risk of developing a blood clot into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use birth control pills are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a blood clot.

However, if you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use birth control pills because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.</p><p>Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.</p><p><span class="Bold">What Should I Know about My Period when Taking</span> <span class="Bold">Tydemy?</span></p><p>Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking Tydemy. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle, is unusually heavy, or lasts for more than a few days, call your healthcare provider.</p><p>Some women may not have a menstrual period but this should not be cause for alarm as long as you have taken the pills regularly on time.</p><p><span class="Bold">What if I Miss My Scheduled Period when Taking</span> <span class="Bold">Tydemy?</span></p><p>It is not uncommon to miss your period. However, if you miss two periods in a row or miss one period when you have not taken your birth control pills regularly on time, call your healthcare provider. Also notify your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. It is important that your healthcare provider checks you to find out if you are pregnant. Stop taking Tydemy if you are pregnant.</p><p><span class="Bold">What If I Want to Become Pregnant?</span></p><p>You may stop taking the pill whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking the pill. See your healthcare provider about appropriate folate supplementation if you stop taking Tydemy, are pregnant, or plan on becoming pregnant.</p><p><span class="Bold">General Advice about</span> <span class="Bold">Tydemy.</span></p><p>Your healthcare provider prescribed Tydemy for you.
