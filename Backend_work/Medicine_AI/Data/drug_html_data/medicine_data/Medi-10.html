</ul><h2>Active Ingredients</h2><h2>Indication and Usage</h2><p class="First">Medi-10 capsule is an orally administered prescription dietary supplement specifically formulated for the dietary management of patients with unique nutritional needs where advanced folate supplementation is required or in management of endothelial dysfunction with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.</p><p><br/>
Medi-10 capsule can be prescribed as therapeutic nutritional supplementation in physiologically stressful conditions for maintenance of good health. It also supports healthy metabolism of glucose and carbohydrates.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><p class="First">Medi-10 capsules should be use only under the direction and supervision of a licensed physician.</p><p>This product is <span class="Bold">contraindicated</span> in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. Call your medical practitioner about side effects.</p><p><span class="Bold">General:</span><br/>
Folates (including folic acid and reduced folates), when administered as a single agent in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure the detection of B12 deficiency (specifically, the administration of folic acid may reverse the hematological manifestations of B12 deficiency, including pernicious anemia, while not addressing the neurological manifestations). Reduced folates may be less likely than folic acid to mask vitamin B12 deficiency. Folate therapy alone is inadequate for the treatment of B12 deficiency.</p><p><span class="Bold">Folate Regulation</span><br/>
The term "folates" are B vitamins that include folic acid and any forms of active pteroylglutamates regardless of the reduction state of the molecule. Folates, or vitamin B9, are primarily hydrolyzed in the intestinal jejunum and the liver to the active circulating form of folate, l-methylfolate, with an intermediate stable form, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate.</p><p>Individuals with genetic polymorphisms for the genes coding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) may not be capable of utilizing or metabolizing folic acid adequately for the vitamin B12dependent methylation cycle.</p><p>Folic acid, including reduced forms<span class="Sup">*</span> such as folinic acid, may obscure pernicious anemia above 0.1 mg doses, and must be administered under the supervision of a licensed medical practitioner.</p><p>The 1971, 1972, 1973, 1980, 1984, 2000, and 2010 Federal Register Notices addressed this concern while establishing that increased folate was proper therapy in megaloblastic anemias - specifically where homocysteine levels were elevated or risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) was at issue.</p><p>The Federal Register Notice of August 2, 1973 (38 FR 20750) specifically states that:<br/>
Dietary supplement preparations are available without a prescription (21 CFR 121.1134). Levels higher than dietary supplement amounts are available only with a prescription.</p><p>Folic acid - including reduced forms, may be added to medical foods undefined in section 5(b)(3) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 USC 360ee(b)(3)), or to food (21 CFR 172.345).</p><p><span class="Sup">*</span> It is not known whether or not l-methylfolate can obscure pernicious anemia above 0.1 mg doses, so caution is advised also with this form of folate.</p><p>Medi-10 capsule is not an antidepressant; however, folate has been shown to enhance antidepressant effects of known antidepressants. Caution is recommended in patients with a history of bipolar illness.</p><h3>Drug Interactions:</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Drug interactions with vitamin B6:</span><br/>
Pyridoxine hydrochloride should not be given to patients receiving the drug levodopa, because the action of levodopa is antagonized by pyridoxine hydrochloride. However, pyridoxine hydrochloride may be used concurrently in patients receiving a preparation containing both carbidopa and levodopa.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Italics">Drug interactions with folate:</span><br/>
• High dose folic acid may result in decreased serum levels for pyrimethamine and first-generation anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, valproic acid, valproate).<br/>
• Folic acid may decrease a patient's response to methotrexate.<br/>
• 5-formyltetrahydrofolate may increase the toxicity of Capecitabine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Drug interactions with vitamin B12:</span><br/>
• Antibiotics, cholestyramine, colchicines, colestipol, metformin, para-aminosalicylic, and potassium chloride may decrease the absorption of vitamin B12.<br/>
• Nitrous oxide can produce a functional vitamin B12 deficiency.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions:</h3><p class="First">Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parental administration of folic acid, and may possibly occur with other forms of folate.</p><p>Allergic reactions have been reported following the use of oral and parenteral vitamin B9.</p><p>Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, transient skin rash, flushing, epigastric pain, and constipation have been associated with acetylcysteine.<br/>
Paresthesia, somnolence, nausea and headaches have been reported with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate.</p><p>Mild transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, itching, transitory exanthema and the feeling of swelling of the entire body has been associated with methylcobalamin.</p><p>All prescriptions using this product shall be pursuant to state statutes as applicable.
