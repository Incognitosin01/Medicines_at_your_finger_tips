It works by relaxing the muscles of your heart and blood vessels.</p><p>Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Valsartan keeps blood vessels from narrowing, which lowers blood pressure and improves blood flow.</p><p>Exforge is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). Lowering blood pressure may lower your risk of a stroke or heart attack.</p><p>Exforge is usually given after other blood pressure medicines have been tried without success.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use Exforge if you are pregnant.</b> If you become pregnant, stop taking this medicine and tell your doctor right away.</p><p>If you have diabetes, do not use Exforge together with any medication that contains aliskiren (such as Amturnide, Tekturna, Valturna, or Tekamlo).</p><p>In rare cases, Exforge can cause a condition that results in the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, leading to kidney failure.
