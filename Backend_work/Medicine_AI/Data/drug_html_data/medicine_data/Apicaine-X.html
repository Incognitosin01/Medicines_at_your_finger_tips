Patients should be instructed to strictly adhere to the recommended dosage and administration guidelines.</p><p>Lidocaine Ointment 5% should be used with extreme caution in the presence of sepsis or severely traumatized mucosa in the area of application, since under such conditions there is the potential for rapid systemic absorption.</p><p><span class="Bold">When using this product,</span><br/>

Lidocaine Ointment may cause drowsiness if it enters your blood stream. If affected, DO NOT drive or operate machinery.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">•</span> Lidocaine Ointment 5% should be used with caution in patients with known drug sensitivities.</p><p><span class="Bold">•</span> When topical anesthetics are used in the mouth, the patient should be aware that the production of topical anaesthesia may impair swallowing and thus enhance the danger of aspiration. For this reason, food should not be ingested for 60 minutes following the use of local anesthetic preparations in the mouth or throat area. This is particularly important in children because of their frequency of eating.</p><p><span class="Bold">•</span> Numbness of the tongue or buccal mucosa may enhance the danger of unintentional biting trauma. Food and chewing gum should not be taken while the mouth or throat area is anesthetized.</p><p><span class="Bold">•</span> The lowest dosage that results in effective anesthesia should be used to avoid high plasma levels and serious adverse effects. Repeated doses of lidocaine may cause significant increases in blood levels with each repeated dose because of slow accumulation of the drug and/or its metabolites.</p><p><span class="Bold">•</span> Lidocaine should also be used with caution in patients with severe shock or heart block.</p><p><span class="Bold">•</span> Early unexplained signs of tachycardia, tachypnea, labile blood pressure and metabolic acidosis may precede temperature elevation. Successful outcome is dependent on early diagnosis, prompt discontinuance of the suspect triggering agent(s) and institution of treatment, including oxygen therapy, indicated supportive measures and dantrolene (consult dantrolene sodium intravenous package insert before using).</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Medicap Laboratories LLC. at 1-800-494-7449 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">•</span> Adverse effects are very rare and dose-related, mostly result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage or rapid absorption, or may result from a hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient.</p><p><span class="Bold">•</span> The following types are those most commonly reported:<br/>
Central nervous system - CNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by light-headedness, drowsiness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest.</p><p><span class="Bold">•</span> Drowsiness is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption.</p><p><span class="Bold">•</span> Cardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, which may lead to cardiac arrest.</p><p><span class="Bold">•</span> An allergic reaction may occur (swelling of the lips, face or neck leading to severe difficulty in breathing; skin rash or hives). This is a very serious but rare side effect. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First">Always use Apicaine-X Ointment exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Otherwise, follow the instructions below. If you are not sure how to use this medicine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</p><p><span class="Bold">Directions:</span><br/>
Clean area with mild soap and warm water. Rinse and dry thoroughly.<br/>
Adults and children 12 years old and older: Apply externally to the affected area up to 6 times a day.<br/>
Children under 12 years of age: Consult a doctor.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adult Dose:</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">•</span> A single application should not exceed 5 g of Lidocaine Ointment 5%, containing 250 mg of lidocaine base (equivalent chemically to approximately 300 mg of lidocaine hydrochloride).<br/>
<span class="Bold">•</span> In a 70 kg adult this dose equals 3.6 mg/kg (1.6 mg/lb) loidocaine base. No more than one-third of a jar, approximately 17-20 g of ointment or 850-1000 mg lidocaine base should be administered in any one day.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dosage for children:</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">•</span> The maximum dose for children may be determined by the application of one of the standard pediatric drug formulas (e.g. Clark's rule). For example a child of five years weighing 50 lbs., the dose of lidocaine should not exceed 75-100 mg when calculated according to Clark's rule.<br/>
<span class="Bold">•</span> In any case, the maximum amount of lidocaine administered should not exceed 4.5 mg/kg (2 mg/lb) of body weight. No more than 3 doses should be administered within 24 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Administration:</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">• </span>In dentistry, apply to previously dried oral mucosa. Subsequent removal of excess saliva with cotton rolls or saliva ejector minimizes dilution of the ointment, permits maximum penetration, and minimizes the possibility of swallowing the topical ointment.<br/>
<span class="Bold">•</span> For use in connection with the insertion of new dentures, apply to all denture surfaces contacting mucosa.<br/>
<span class="Bold">•</span> Nursing mothers<br/>
Apply to the nipples using a small piece of lint or gauze, wash off immediately before the next feed</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED:</h2><p class="First">Lidocaine Ointment, 5% is available in 50 g (1.76 oz) Jar.</p><h2>STORAGE AND HANDLING:</h2><p class="First">Store at controlled room temperature 20° - 25° C (68° - 77° F).<br/>
