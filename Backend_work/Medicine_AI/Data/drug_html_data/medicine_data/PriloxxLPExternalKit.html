</ul><h2>Priloxx LP External Kit Description</h2><p>Lidocaine 2.5% and Prilocaine 2.5% Cream, USP is an emulsion in which the oil phase is a eutectic<br/>
mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine cream in a ratio of 1:1 by weight. This eutectic mixture has a<br/>
melting point below room temperature and therefore both local anesthetics exist as a liquid oil rather<br/>
than as crystals. It is packaged in 5 gram and 30 gram tubes.<br/>
Lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an<br/>
octanol: water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure:</p><p></p><p><br/>
Prilocaine is chemically designated as propanamide, N-(2-methylphenyl)-2-(propylamino), has an<br/>
octanol: water partition ratio of 25 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure:</p><p></p><p>Each gram of lidocaine and prilocaine cream contains lidocaine 25 mg, prilocaine 25 mg,<br/>
polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters (as emulsifiers), carboxypolymethylene (as a thickening agent),<br/>
sodium hydroxide to adjust to a pH approximating 9, and purified water to 1 gram. Lidocaine and<br/>
prilocaine cream contains no preservative, however it passes the USP antimicrobial effectiveness test<br/>
due to the pH. The specific gravity of lidocaine and prilocaine cream is 1.00.</p><h2>Priloxx LP External Kit - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span>: Lidocaine and prilocaine cream applied to intact skin under occlusive dressing,<br/>
provides dermal analgesia by the release of lidocaine and prilocaine from the cream into the epidermal<br/>
and dermal layers of the skin and by the accumulation of lidocaine and prilocaine in the vicinity of<br/>
dermal pain receptors and nerve endings. Lidocaine and prilocaine are amide-type local anesthetic<br/>
agents. Both lidocaine and prilocaine stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes<br/>
required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action.<br/>
The onset, depth and duration of dermal analgesia on intact skin provided by lidocaine and prilocaine<br/>
cream depend primarily on the duration of application. To provide sufficient analgesia for clinical<br/>
procedures such as intravenous catheter placement and venipuncture, lidocaine and prilocaine cream<br/>
should be applied under an occlusive dressing for at least 1 hour. To provide dermal analgesia for<br/>
clinical procedures such as split skin graft harvesting, lidocaine and prilocaine cream should be applied<br/>
under occlusive dressing for at least 2 hours. Satisfactory dermal analgesia is achieved 1 hour after<br/>
application, reaches maximum at 2 to 3 hours, and persists for 1 to 2 hours after removal. Absorption<br/>
from the genital mucosa is more rapid and onset time is shorter (5 to 10 minutes) than after application to<br/>
intact skin. After a 5 to 10 minute application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream to female genital<br/>
mucosa, the average duration of effective analgesia to an argon laser stimulus (which produced a sharp,<br/>
pricking pain) was 15 to 20 minutes (individual variations in the range of 5 to 45 minutes).</p><p>Dermal application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream may cause a transient, local blanching followed by<br/>
a transient, local redness or erythema.</p><p>​ <span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span>: Lidocaine and prilocaine cream is a eutectic mixture of lidocaine 2.5% and<br/>
prilocaine 2.5% formulated as an oil in water emulsion. In this eutectic mixture, both anesthetics are<br/>
liquid at room temperature (see DESCRIPTION) and the penetration and subsequent systemic absorption<br/>
of both prilocaine and lidocaine are enhanced over that which would be seen if each component in<br/>
crystalline form was applied separately as a 2.5% topical cream.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Italics">Absorption</span>: The amount of lidocaine and prilocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine and prilocaine<br/>
cream is directly related to both the duration of application and to the area over which it is applied. In<br/>
two pharmacokinetic studies, 60 g of lidocaine and prilocaine cream (1.5 g lidocaine and 1.5 g<br/>
prilocaine) was applied to 400 cm of intact skin on the lateral thigh and then covered by an occlusive<br/>
dressing. The subjects were then randomized such that one-half of the subjects had the occlusive<br/>
dressing and residual cream removed after 3 hours, while the remainder left the dressing in place for 24<br/>
hours. The results from these studies are summarized below.</p><p></p><p><br/>
When 60 g of lidocaine and prilocaine cream was applied over 400 cm for 24 hours, peak blood<br/>
levels of lidocaine are approximately 1/20 the systemic toxic level. Likewise, the maximum prilocaine<br/>
level is about 1/36 the toxic level. In a pharmacokinetic study, lidocaine and prilocaine cream was<br/>
applied to penile skin in 20 adult male patients in doses ranging from 0.5 g to 3.3 g for 15 minutes.<br/>
Plasma concentrations of lidocaine and prilocaine following lidocaine and prilocaine cream application<br/>
in this study were consistently low (2.5 to 16 ng/mL for lidocaine and 2.5 to 7 ng/mL for prilocaine).<br/>
The application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream to broken or inflamed skin, or to 2,000 cm or more<br/>
of skin where more of both anesthetics are absorbed, could result in higher plasma levels that could, in<br/>
susceptible individuals, produce a systemic pharmacologic response.</p><p><br/>
The absorption of lidocaine and prilocaine cream applied to genital mucous membranes was studied in<br/>
two open-label clinical trials. Twenty-nine patients received 10 g of lidocaine and prilocaine cream<br/>
applied for 10 to 60 minutes in the vaginal fornices. Plasma concentrations of lidocaine and prilocaine<br/>
following lidocaine and prilocaine cream application in these studies ranged from 148 to 641 ng/mL for<br/>
lidocaine and 40 to 346 ng/mL for prilocaine and time to reach maximum concentration (t ) ranged<br/>
from 21 to 125 minutes for lidocaine and from 21 to 95 minutes for prilocaine. These levels are well<br/>
below the concentrations anticipated to give rise to systemic toxicity (approximately 5000 ng/mL for<br/>
lidocaine and prilocaine).</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Distribution</span>: When each drug is administered intravenously, the steady-state volume of distribution is<br/>
1.1 to 2.1 L/kg (mean 1.5, ±0.3 SD, n=13) for lidocaine and is 0.7 to 4.4 L/kg (mean 2.6, ±1.3 SD, n=13)<br/>
for prilocaine. The larger distribution volume for prilocaine produces the lower plasma concentrations<br/>
of prilocaine observed when equal amounts of prilocaine and lidocaine are administered. At<br/>
concentrations produced by application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream, lidocaine is approximately<br/>
70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma<br/>
concentrations (1 to 4 μg/mL of free base) the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration<br/>
dependent. Prilocaine is 55% bound to plasma proteins. Both lidocaine and prilocaine cross the<br/>
placental and blood brain barrier, presumably by passive diffusion.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Metabolism</span>: It is not known if lidocaine or prilocaine are metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is<br/>
metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites including monoethylglycinexylidide<br/>
(MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less<br/>
potent than that of lidocaine. The metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity.<br/>
Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and<br/>
from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Prilocaine is metabolized in both the liver and<br/>
kidneys by amidases to various metabolites including ortho-toluidine and N-n-propylalanine. It is not<br/>
metabolized by plasma esterases. The ortho-toluidine metabolite has been shown to be carcinogenic in<br/>
several animal models (see Carcinogenesis subsection of PRECAUTIONS). In addition, ortho-toluidine<br/>
can produce methemoglobinemia following systemic doses of prilocaine approximating 8 mg/kg (see<br/>
ADVERSE REACTIONS). Very young patients, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydro- genase<br/>
deficiencies and patients taking oxidizing drugs such as antimalarials and sulfonamides are more<br/>
susceptible to methemoglobinemia (seeMethemoglobinemia subsection of WARNINGS).</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Elimination</span>: The terminal elimination half-life of lidocaine from the plasma following IV administration<br/>
is approximately 65 to 150 minutes (mean 110, ±24 SD, n=13). More than 98% of an absorbed dose of<br/>
lidocaine can be recovered in the urine as metabolites or parent drug. The systemic clearance is 10 to<br/>
20 mL/min/kg (mean 13, ±3 SD, n=13). The elimination half-life of prilocaine is approximately 10 to 150<br/>
minutes (mean 70, ±48 SD, n=13). The systemic clearance is 18 to 64 mL/min/kg (mean 38, ±15 SD,<br/>
n=13). During intravenous studies, the elimination half-life of lidocaine was statistically significantly<br/>
longer in elderly patients (2.5 hours) than in younger patients (1.5 hours). No studies are available on the<br/>
intravenous pharmacokinetics of prilocaine in elderly patients.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Pediatrics</span>: Some pharmacokinetic (PK) data are available in infants (1 month to &lt;2 years old) and<br/>
children (2 to &lt;12 years old). One PK study was conducted in 9 full-term neonates (mean age: 7 days and<br/>
mean gestational age: 38.8 weeks). The study results show that neonates had comparable plasma<br/>
lidocaine and prilocaine concentrations and blood methemoglobin concentrations as those found in<br/>
previous pediatric PK studies and clinical trials. There was a tendency towards an increase in<br/>
methemoglobin formation. However, due to assay limitations and very little amount of blood that could<br/>
be collected from neonates, large variations in the above reported concentrations were found.<br/>
Special Populations: No specific PK studies were conducted. The half-life may be increased in cardiac<br/>
or hepatic dysfunction. Prilocaine's half-life also may be increased in hepatic or renal dysfunction since<br/>
both of these organs are involved in prilocaine metabolism.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span>: No specific PK studies were conducted. The half-life may be increased in cardiac<br/>
or hepatic dysfunction. Prilocaine's half-life also may be increased in hepatic or renal dysfunction since<br/>
both of these organs are involved in prilocaine metabolism.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p>Lidocaine and prilocaine cream application in adults prior to IV cannulation or venipuncture was studied<br/>
in 200 patients in four clinical studies in Europe. Application for at least 1 hour provided significantly<br/>
more dermal analgesia than placebo cream or ethyl chloride. Lidocaine and prilocaine cream was<br/>
comparable to subcutaneous lidocaine, but was less efficacious than intradermal lidocaine. Most<br/>
patients found lidocaine and prilocaine cream treatment preferable to lidocaine infiltration or ethyl<br/>
chloride spray.<br/>
Lidocaine and prilocaine cream was compared with 0.5% lidocaine infiltration prior to skin graft<br/>
harvesting in one open label study in 80 adult patients in England. Application of lidocaine and<br/>
prilocaine cream for 2 to 5 hours provided dermal analgesia comparable to lidocaine infiltration.<br/>
Lidocaine and prilocaine cream application in children was studied in seven non-US studies (320<br/>
patients) and one US study (100 patients). In controlled studies, application of lidocaine and prilocaine<br/>
cream for at least 1 hour with or without presurgical medication prior to needle insertion provided<br/>
significantly more pain reduction than placebo. In children under the age of seven years, lidocaine and<br/>
prilocaine cream was less effective than in older children or adults.<br/>
Lidocaine and prilocaine cream was compared with placebo in the laser treatment of facial port-wine<br/>
stains in 72 pediatric patients (ages 5 to 16). Lidocaine and prilocaine cream was effective in providing<br/>
pain relief during laser treatment.<br/>
Lidocaine and prilocaine cream alone was compared with lidocaine and prilocaine cream followed by<br/>
lidocaine infiltration and lidocaine infiltration alone prior to cryotherapy for the removal of male genital<br/>
warts. The data from 121 patients demonstrated that lidocaine and prilocaine cream was not effective as<br/>
a sole anesthetic agent in managing the pain from the surgical procedure. The administration of<br/>
lidocaine and prilocaine cream prior to lidocaine infiltration provided significant relief of discomfort<br/>
associated with local anesthetic infiltration and thus was effective in the overall reduction of pain from<br/>
the procedure only when used in conjunction with local anesthetic infiltration of lidocaine.<br/>
Lidocaine and prilocaine cream was studied in 105 full term neonates (gestational age: 37 weeks) for<br/>
blood drawing and circumcision procedures. When considering the use of lidocaine and prilocaine<br/>
cream in neonates, the primary concerns are the systemic absorption of the active ingredients and the<br/>
subsequent formation of methemoglobin. In clinical studies performed in neonates, the plasma levels of<br/>
lidocaine, prilocaine, and methemoglobin were not reported in a range expected to cause clinical<br/>
symptoms.<br/>
Local dermal effects associated with lidocaine and prilocaine cream application in these studies on<br/>
intact skin included paleness, redness and edema and were transient in nature (see ADVERSE<br/>
REACTIONS).<br/>
The application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream on genital mucous membranes for minor, superficial<br/>
surgical procedures (eg, removal of condylomata acuminata) was studied in 80 patients in a placebocontrolled<br/>
clinical trial (60 patients received lidocaine and prilocaine cream and 20 patients received<br/>
placebo). Lidocaine and prilocaine cream (5 to 10 g) applied between 1 and 75 minutes before surgery,<br/>
with a median time of 15 minutes, provided effective local anesthesia for minor superficial surgical<br/>
procedures. The greatest extent of analgesia, as measured by VAS scores, was attained after 5 to 15<br/>
minutes' application. The application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream to genital mucous membranes as<br/>
pretreatment for local anesthetic infiltration was studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in<br/>
44 female patients (21 patients received lidocaine and prilocaine cream and 23 patients received<br/>
placebo) scheduled for infiltration prior to a surgical procedure of the external vulva or genital<br/>
mucosa. Lidocaine and prilocaine cream applied to the genital mucous membranes for 5 to 10 minutes<br/>
resulted in adequate topical anesthesia for local anesthetic injection.</p><p><br/>
Individualization of Dose: The dose of lidocaine and prilocaine cream that provides effective<br/>
analgesia depends on the duration of the application over the treated area.<br/>
All pharmacokinetic and clinical studies employed a thick layer of lidocaine and prilocaine cream (1 to<br/>
2 g/10 cm ). The duration of application prior to venipuncture was 1 hour. The duration 2 of application<br/>
prior to taking split thickness skin grafts was 2 hours. A thinner application has not been studied and may<br/>
result in less complete analgesia or a shorter duration of adequate analgesia.<br/>
The systemic absorption of lidocaine and prilocaine is a side effect of the desired local effect. The<br/>
amount of drug absorbed depends on surface area and duration of application. The systemic blood<br/>
levels depend on the amount absorbed and patient size (weight) and the rate of systemic drug elimination.<br/>
Long duration of application, large treatment area, small patients, or impaired elimination may result in<br/>
high blood levels. The systemic blood levels are typically a small fraction (1/20 to 1/36) of the blood<br/>
levels that produce toxicity. Table 2 below gives maximum recommended doses, application areas and<br/>
application times for infants and children.</p><p></p><p>Please note: If a patient greater than 3 months old does not meet the minimum weight requirement, the<br/>
maximum total dose of lidocaine and prilocaine cream should be restricted to that which corresponds to<br/>
the patient's weight.<br/>
* These are broad guidelines for avoiding systemic toxicity in applying lidocaine and prilocaine cream<br/>
to patients with normal intact skin and with normal renal and hepatic function.<br/>
** For more individualized calculation of how much lidocaine and prilocaine may be absorbed,<br/>
physicians can use the following estimates of lidocaine and prilocaine absorption for children and<br/>
adults:<br/>
The estimated mean (±SD) absorption of lidocaine is 0.045 (±0.016) mg/cm /hr.<br/>
The estimated mean (±SD) absorption of prilocaine is 0.077 (±0.036) mg/cm /hr.</p><p><br/>
An I.V. antiarrhythmic dose of lidocaine is 1 mg/kg (70 mg/70 kg) and gives a blood level of about 1<br/>
μg/mL. Toxicity would be expected at blood levels above 5 μg/mL. Smaller areas of treatment are<br/>
recommended in a debilitated patient, a small child or a patient with impaired elimination. Decreasing the<br/>
duration of application is likely to decrease the analgesic effect.</p><h2>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h2><p class="First">Lidocaine and prilocaine cream (a eutectic mixture of lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5%) is indicated<br/>
as a topical anesthetic for use on:<br/>
- normal intact skin for local analgesia.<br/>
- genital mucous membranes for superficial minor surgery and as pretreatment for infiltration<br/>
anesthesia.<br/>
Lidocaine and prilocaine cream is not recommended in any clinical situation when penetration or<br/>
migration beyond the tympanic membrane into the middle ear is possible because of the ototoxic effects<br/>
observed in animal studies (see WARNINGS).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Lidocaine and prilocaine cream (lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5%) is contraindicated in patients with<br/>
a known history of sensitivity to local anesthetics of the amide type or to any other component of the<br/>
product.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream to larger areas or for longer times than those<br/>
recommended could result in sufficient absorption of lidocaine and prilocaine resulting in serious<br/>
adverse effects (see Individualization of Dose).<br/>
Patients treated with class III anti-arrhythmic drugs (e.g., amiodarone, bretylium, sotalol, dofetilide)<br/>
should be under close surveillance and ECG monitoring considered, because cardiac effects may be<br/>
additive.<br/>
Studies in laboratory animals (guinea pigs) have shown that lidocaine and prilocaine cream has an<br/>
ototoxic effect when instilled into the middle ear. In these same studies, animals exposed to lidocaine<br/>
and prilocaine cream only in the external auditory canal, showed no abnormality. Lidocaine and<br/>
prilocaine cream should not be used in any clinical situation when its penetration or migration beyond<br/>
the tympanic membrane into the middle ear is possible.<br/>
Methemoglobinemia: Lidocaine and prilocaine cream should not be used in those rare patients with<br/>
congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia and in infants under the age of twelve months who are<br/>
receiving treatment with methemoglobin-inducing agents.<br/>
Very young patients or patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencies are more<br/>
susceptible to methemoglobinemia.<br/>
Patients taking drugs associated with drug-induced methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides,<br/>
acetaminophen, acetanilid, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and<br/>
nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin,<br/>
phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, quinine, are also at greater risk for developing<br/>
methemoglobinemia.<br/>
There have been reports of significant methemoglobinemia (20 to 30%) in infants and children<br/>
following excessive applications of lidocaine and prilocaine cream. These cases involved the use of<br/>
large doses, larger than recommended areas of application, or infants under the age of 3 months who did<br/>
not have fully mature enzyme systems. In addition, a few of these cases involved the concomitant<br/>
administration of methemoglobin-inducing agents. Most patients recovered spontaneously after removal<br/>
of the cream. Treatment with IV methylene blue may be effective if required.<br/>
Physicians are cautioned to make sure that parents orother caregivers understand the need for careful<br/>
application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream, to ensure that the doses and areas of application<br/>
recommended in Table 2 are not exceeded (especially in children under the age of 3 months) and to limit<br/>
the period of application to the minimum required to achieve the desired anesthesia.<br/>
Neonates and infants up to 3 months of age should be monitored for Met-Hb levels before, during, and<br/>
after the application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream, provided the test results can be obtained quickly.</p><h2>PRECAUTION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span>: Repeated doses of lidocaine and prilocaine cream may increase blood levels of lidocaine and<br/>
prilocaine. Lidocaine and prilocaine cream should be used with caution in patients who may be more<br/>
sensitive to the systemic effects of lidocaine and prilocaine including acutely ill, debilitated, or elderly<br/>
patients.</p><p><br/>
Lidocaine and prilocaine cream should not be applied to open wounds.</p><p><br/>
Care should be taken not to allow lidocaine and prilocaine cream to come in contact with the eye<br/>
because animal studies have demonstrated severe eye irritation. Also the loss of protective reflexes can<br/>
permit corneal irritation and potential abrasion. Absorption of lidocaine and prilocaine cream in<br/>
conjunctival tissues has not been determined. If eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with<br/>
water or saline and protect the eye until sensation returns.</p><p><br/>
Patients allergic to paraaminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not<br/>
shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine and/or prilocaine, however, lidocaine and prilocaine cream should<br/>
be used with caution in patients with a history of drug sensitivities, especially if the etiologic agent is<br/>
uncertain.</p><p><br/>
Patients with severe hepatic disease, because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally,<br/>
are at greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations of lidocaine and prilocaine.</p><p><br/>
Lidocaine and prilocaine have been shown to inhibit viral and bacterial growth. The effect of lidocaine<br/>
and prilocaine cream on intradermal injections of live vaccines has not been determined.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span> : When lidocaine and prilocaine cream is used, the patient should be aware that<br/>
the production of dermal analgesia may be accompanied by the block of all sensations in the treated skin.<br/>
For this reason, the patient should avoid inadvertent trauma to the treated area by scratching, rubbing, or<br/>
exposure to extreme hot or cold temperatures until complete sensation has returned.<br/>
Lidocaine and prilocaine cream should not be applied near the eyes or on open wounds.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span> : Lidocaine and prilocaine cream should be used with caution in patients receiving<br/>
Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and<br/>
potentially synergistic.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Prilocaine may contribute to the formation of methemoglobin in patients treated with other drugs<br/>
known to cause this condition</span> (see Methemoglobinemia subsection of WARNINGS).</p><p><br/>
Specific interaction studies with lidocaine/prilocaine and class III anti-arrhythmic drugs (e.g.,<br/>
amiodarone, bretylium, sotalol, doetilide) have not been performed, but caution is advised (see<br/>
WARNINGS).</p><p><br/>
Should lidocaine and prilocaine cream be used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine<br/>
and/or prilocaine, cumulative doses from all formulations must be considered.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p><br/>
<span class="Italics">Carcinogenesis</span>: Long-term studies in animals designed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of<br/>
lidocaine and prilocaine have not been conducted.</p><p><br/>
Metabolites of prilocaine have been shown to be carcinogenic in laboratory animals. In the animal<br/>
studies reported below, doses or blood levels are compared with the Single Dermal Administration<br/>
(SDA) of 60 g of lidocaine and prilocaine cream to 400 cm for 3 hours to a small person (50 kg). The<br/>
typical application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream for one or two treatments for venipuncture sites<br/>
(2.5 or 5 g) would be 1/24 or 1/12 of that dose in an adult or about the same mg/kg dose in an infant.</p><p><br/>
Chronic oral toxicity studies of ortho-toluidine, a metabolite of prilocaine, in mice (450 to 7200 mg/m<br/>
; 60 to 960 times SDA) and rats (900 to 4,800 mg/m ; 60 to 320 times SDA) have shown that orthotoluidine<br/>
is a carcinogen in both species. The tumors included hepatocarcinomas/adenomas in female<br/>
mice, multiple occurrences of hemangiosarcomas/hemangiomas in both sexes of mice, sarcomas of<br/>
multiple organs, transitional-cell carcinomas/papillomas of urinary bladder in both sexes of rats,<br/>
subcutaneous fibromas/fibrosarcomas and mesotheliomas in male rats, and mammary gland<br/>
fibroadenomas/adenomas in female rats. The lowest dose tested (450 mg/m in mice, 900 mg/m in<br/>
rats; 60 times SDA) was carcinogenic in both species. Thus the no-effect dose must be less than 60<br/>
times SDA. The animal studies were conducted at 150 to 2,400 mg/kg in mice and at 150 to 800 mg/kg<br/>
in rats. The dosages have been converted to mg/m for the SDA calculations above.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Mutagenesis</span>: The mutagenic potential of lidocaine HCl has been tested in a bacterial reverse (Ames)<br/>
assay in Salmonella, an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay using human lymphocytes an in vivo<br/>
micronucleus test in mice. There was no indication of mutagenicity or structural damage to<br/>
chromosomes in these tests.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Italics">Ortho</span>-toluidine, a metabolite of prilocaine, at a concentration of 0.5 μg/mL, was genotoxic in<br/>
<span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span> DNA repair and phage-induction assays. Urine concentrates from rats treated with<br/>
ortho-toluidine (300 mg/kg orally; 300 times SDA) were mutagenic when examined in <span class="Italics">Salmonella<br/>
typhimurium</span> in the presence of metabolic activation. Several other tests on ortho-toluidine, including<br/>
reverse mutations in five different Salmonella typhimurium strains in the presence or absence of<br/>
metabolic activation and a study to detect single strand breaks in DNA of V79 Chinese hamster cells,<br/>
were negative.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Italics">Impairment of Fertility</span>: See Use in Pregnancy.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Use in Pregnancy</span>: <span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category B</span>.<br/>
Reproduction studies with lidocaine have been performed in rats and have revealed no evidence of harm<br/>
to the fetus (30 mg/kg subcutaneously; 22 times SDA). Reproduction studies with prilocaine have been<br/>
performed in rats and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus (300 mg/kg<br/>
intramuscularly; 188 times SDA). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in<br/>
pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response,<br/>
lidocaine and prilocaine cream should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.<br/>
Reproduction studies have been performed in rats receiving subcutaneous administration of an aqueous<br/>
mixture containing lidocaine HCl and prilocaine HCl at 1:1 (w/w). At 40 mg/kg each, a dose equivalent<br/>
to 29 times SDA lidocaine and 25 times SDA prilocaine, no teratogenic, embryotoxic or fetotoxic<br/>
effects were observed.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Labor and Delivery</span>: Neither lidocaine nor prilocaine are contraindicated in labor and delivery. Should<br/>
lidocaine and prilocaine cream be used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine and/or<br/>
prilocaine, cumulative doses from all formulations must be considered.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span> : Lidocaine, and probably prilocaine, are excreted in human milk. Therefore, caution<br/>
should be exercised when lidocaine and prilocaine cream is administered to a nursing mother since the<br/>
milk:plasma ratio of lidocaine is 0.4 and is not determined for prilocaine.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span>: Controlled studies of lidocaine and prilocaine cream in children under the age of seven<br/>
years have shown less overall benefit than in older children or adults. These results illustrate the<br/>
importance of emotional and psychological support of younger children undergoing medical or<br/>
surgical procedures.</p><p><br/>
Lidocaine and prilocaine cream should be used with care in patients with conditions or therapy<br/>
associated with methemoglobinemia (see Methemoglobinemia subsection of WARNINGS).<br/>
When using lidocaine and prilocaine cream in young children, especially infants under the age of 3<br/>
months, care must be taken to insure that the caregiver understands the need to limit the dose and area of<br/>
application, and to prevent accidental ingestion (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and<br/>
Methemoglobinemia).</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">In neonates (minimum ges tation age: 37 weeks ) and children weighing les s than 20 kg, the area<br/>
and duration of application should be limited</span> (see TABLE 2 in Individualization of Dose).<br/>
Studies have not demonstrated the efficacy of lidocaine and prilocaine cream for heel lancing in<br/>
neonates.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span>: Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of lidocaine and prilocaine cream, 180<br/>
were age 65 to 74 and 138 were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were<br/>
observed between these patients and younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not<br/>
identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of<br/>
some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><p><br/>
Plasma levels of lidocaine and prilocaine in geriatric and non-geriatric patients following application of<br/>
a thick layer of lidocaine and prilocaine cream are very low and well below potentially toxic levels.<br/>
However, there are no sufficient data to evaluate quantitative differences in systemic plasma levels of<br/>
lidocaine and prilocaine between geriatric and non-geriatric patients following application of lidocaine<br/>
and prilocaine cream.</p><p><br/>
Consideration should be given for those elderly patients who have enhanced sensitivity to systemic<br/>
absorption (see PRECAUTIONS).</p><p><br/>
After intravenous dosing, the elimination half-life of lidocaine is significantly longer in elderly patients<br/>
(2.5 hours) than in younger patients (1.5 hours). (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Localized Reactions : During or immediately after treatment with lidocaine and prilocaine cream on<br/>
intact skin, the skin at the site of treatment may develop erythema or edema or may be the locus of<br/>
abnormal sensation. Rare cases of discrete purpuric or petechial reactions at the application site have<br/>
been reported. Rare cases of hyperpigmentation following the use of lidocaine and prilocaine cream<br/>
have been reported. The relationship to lidocaine and prilocaine cream or the underlying procedure has<br/>
not been established. In clinical studies on intact skin involving over 1,300 lidocaine and prilocaine<br/>
cream-treated subjects, one or more such local reactions were noted in 56% of patients, and were<br/>
generally mild and transient, resolving spontaneously within 1 or 2 hours. There were no serious<br/>
reactions that were ascribed to lidocaine and prilocaine cream.</p><p><br/>
Two recent reports describe blistering on the foreskin in neonates about to undergo circumcision. Both<br/>
neonates received 1.0 g of lidocaine and prilocaine cream.</p><p><br/>
In patients treated with lidocaine and prilocaine cream on intact skin, local effects observed in the trials<br/>
included: paleness (pallor or blanching) 37%, redness (erythema) 30%, alterations in temperature<br/>
sensations 7%, edema 6%, itching 2% and rash, less than 1%.</p><p><br/>
In clinical studies on genital mucous membranes involving 378 lidocaine and prilocaine cream-treated<br/>
patients, one or more application site reactions, usually mild and transient, were noted in 41% of<br/>
patients. The most common application site reactions were redness (21%), burning sensation (17%) and<br/>
edema (10%).</p><p><br/>
Allergic Reactions : Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine or prilocaine can<br/>
occur. They are characterized by urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and shock. If they occur they<br/>
should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful<br/>
value.</p><p><br/>
Systemic (Dose Related) Reactions : Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of<br/>
lidocaine and prilocaine cream are unlikely due to the small dose absorbed (see Pharmacokinetics<br/>
subsection of CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine and/or<br/>
prilocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents including<br/>
CNS excitation and/or depression (light-headedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion,<br/>
dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness,<br/>
twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest). Excitatory CNS<br/>
reactions may be brief or not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness<br/>
merging into unconsciousness. Cardiovascular manifestations may include bradycardia, hypotension and<br/>
cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Peak blood levels following a 60 g application to 400 cm of intact skin for 3 hours are 0.05 to 0.16<br/>
μg/mL for lidocaine and 0.02 to 0.10 μg/mL for prilocaine. Toxic levels of lidocaine (&gt;5 μg/mL) and/or<br/>
prilocaine (&gt;6 μg/mL) cause decreases in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance and mean arterial<br/>
pressure. These changes may be attributable to direct depressant effects of these local anesthetic agents<br/>
on the cardiovascular system. In the absence of massive topical overdose or oral ingestion, evaluation<br/>
should include evaluation of other etiologies for the clinical effects or overdosage from other sources<br/>
of lidocaine, prilocaine or other local anesthetics. Consult the package inserts for parenteral Xylocaine<br/>
(lidocaine HCl) or Citanest (prilocaine HCl) for further information for the management of overdose.</p><h2>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adult Patients -Intact Skin</span><br/>
A thick layer of lidocaine and prilocaine cream is applied to intact skin and covered with an occlusive<br/>
dressing (see INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPLICATION).</p><p><span class="Bold">Minor Dermal Procedures</span> : For minor procedures such as intravenous cannulation and venipuncture,<br/>
apply 2.5 grams of lidocaine and prilocaine cream (1/2 the 5 g tube) over 20 to 25 cm of skin surface<br/>
for at least 1 hour. In controlled clinical trials using lidocaine and prilocaine cream, two sites were<br/>
usually prepared in case there was a technical problem with cannulation or venipuncture at the first site.<br/>
Major Dermal Procedures : For more painful dermatological procedures involving a larger skin area<br/>
such as split thickness skin graft harvesting, apply 2 grams of lidocaine and prilocaine cream per 10 cm<br/>
of skin and allow to remain in contact with the skin for at least 2 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adult Male Genital Skin:</span> As an adjunct prior to local anesthetic infiltration, apply a thick layer of<br/>
lidocaine and prilocaine cream (1 g/10 cm ) to the skin surface for 15 minutes. Local anesthetic<br/>
infiltration should be performed immediately after removal of lidocaine and prilocaine cream.<br/>
Dermal analgesia can be expected to increase for up to 3 hours under occlusive dressing and persist for<br/>
1 to 2 hours after removal of the cream. The amount of lidocaine and prilocaine absorbed during the<br/>
period of application can be estimated from the information in Table 2, ** footnote, in Individualization<br/>
of Dose.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Adult Female Patients -Genital Mucous Membranes</span><br/>
For minor procedures on the female external genitalia, such as removal of condylomata acuminata, as<br/>
well as for use as pretreatment for anesthetic infiltration, apply a thick layer (5 to 10 grams) of lidocaine<br/>
and prilocaine cream for 5 to 10 minutes.</p><p><br/>
Occlusion is not necessary for absorption, but may be helpful to keep the cream in place. Patients<br/>
should be lying down during the lidocaine and prilocaine cream application, especially if no occlusion<br/>
is used. The procedure or the local anesthetic infiltration should be performed immediately after the<br/>
removal of lidocaine and prilocaine cream.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients -Intact Skin</span><br/>
The following are the maximum recommended doses, application areas and application times for<br/>
lidocaine and prilocaine cream based on a child's age and weight:</p><p class="First">Maximum Total<br/>
Dose of Lidocaine and</p><p>Prilocaine Cream</p><p><br/>
Please note: If a patient greater than 3 months old does not meet the minimum weight requirement, the<br/>
maximum total dose of lidocaine and prilocaine cream should be restricted to that which corresponds to<br/>
the patient's weight (see INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPLICATION).</p><p><br/>
Practitioners should carefully instruct caregivers to avoid application of excessive amounts of<br/>
lidocaine and prilocaine cream (see PRECAUTIONS).</p><p><br/>
When applying lidocaine and prilocaine cream to the skin of young children, care must be taken to<br/>
maintain careful observation of the child to prevent accidental ingestion of lidocaine and prilocaine<br/>
cream or the occlusive dressing. A secondary protective covering to prevent inadvertent disruption of<br/>
the application site may be useful.</p><p><br/>
Lidocaine and prilocaine cream s hould not be us ed in neonates with a ges tational age les s than 37<br/>
weeks nor in infants under the age of 12 months who are receiving treatment with<br/>
methemoglobin-inducing agents (s ee Methemoglobinemia s ubs ection of WARNINGS).</p><p><br/>
When lidocaine and prilocaine cream (lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5%) is used concomitantly with<br/>
other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be<br/>
considered (see Individualization of Dose). The amount absorbed in the case of lidocaine and prilocaine<br/>
cream is determined by the area over which it is applied and the duration of application under occlusion<br/>
(see Table 2, ** footnote, in Individualization of Dose).</p><p><br/>
Although the incidence of systemic adverse reactions with lidocaine and prilocaine cream is very low,<br/>
caution should be exercised, particularly when applying it over large areas and leaving it on for longer<br/>
than 2 hours. The incidence of systemic adverse reactions can be expected to be directly proportional<br/>
to the area and time of exposure (see Individualization of Dose).</p><h2>INSTRUCTION FOR APPLICATION</h2><p class="First">To measure 1 gram of lidocaine and prilocaine cream, the Cream should be gently squeezed out of the<br/>
tube as a narrow strip that is 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) long and 0.2 inches (5 mm) wide. The strip of lidocaine<br/>
and prilocaine cream should be contained within the lines of the diagram shown below.</p><p><br/>
Use the number of strips that equals your dose, like the examples in the table below.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Dosing Information</span><br/>
1 gram = 1 strip<br/>
2 grams = 2 strips<br/>
2.5 grams = 2.5 strips</p><p><br/>
For adult and pediatric patients, apply ONLY as prescribed by your physician.<br/>
If your child is below the age of 3 months or small for their age, please inform your doctor before<br/>
applying lidocaine and prilocaine cream, which can be harmful, if applied over too much skin at one<br/>
time in young children.</p><p><br/>
When applying lidocaine and prilocaine cream to the intact skin of young children, it is important that<br/>
they be carefully observed by an adult in order to prevent the accidental ingestion of or eye contact with<br/>
lidocaine and prilocaine cream.</p><p><br/>
Lidocaine and prilocaine cream must be applied to intact skin at least 1 hour before the start of a routine<br/>
procedure and for 2 hours before the start of a painful procedure. A protective covering of the cream is<br/>
not necessary for absorption but may be helpful to keep the cream in place.</p><p><br/>
If using a protective covering, your doctor will remove it, wipe off the lidocaine and prilocaine cream,<br/>
and clean the entire area with an antiseptic solution before the procedure. The duration of effective skin<br/>
anesthesia will be at least 1 hour after removal of the protective covering.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Precautions</span><br/>
1. Do not apply near eyes or open wounds.<br/>
2. Keep out of the reach of children.<br/>
3. If your child becomes very dizzy, excessively sleepy, or develops duskiness of the face or lips<br/>
after applying lidocaine and prilocaine cream, remove the cream and contact the child's physician at<br/>
once.</p><h2>How is Priloxx LP External Kit Supplied</h2><p class="First">Priloxx LP External Pak (Lidocaine 2.5% and Prilocaine 2.5% Cream, USP) with Occlusive</p><p>Dressing Contains:</p><p class="First">packed individually; in a</p><p>child-resistant tube</p><p class="First">occlusive</p><p>NOT FOR OPHTHALMIC USE.<br/>
