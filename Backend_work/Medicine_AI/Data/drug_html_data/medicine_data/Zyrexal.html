</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FACTS</span></p><p>Zyrexal™ is an orally administered prescription tablet<br/>
formulation for the clinical dietary management of<br/>
suboptimal nutritional status in patients where advanced<br/>
folate supplementation is required and nutritional<br/>
supplementation in physiologically stressful conditions for<br/>
maintenance of good health is needed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</span></p><p>This product is contraindicated in patients with a known<br/>
hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. Zyrexal™ tablets<br/>
should only be used under the direction and supervision of a<br/>
licensed medical practitioner. Use with caution in patients that<br/>
may have a medical condition, are pregnant, lactating, trying to<br/>
conceive, under the age of 18, or taking medications.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have: kidney problems, thyroid disease.<br/>
This medication should be used as directed during pregnancy<br/>
or while breast-feeding. Consult your doctor about the risks<br/>
and benefits. Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the<br/>
treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic<br/>
anemias where vitamin B12 is deficient. Folic acid in doses<br/>
above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in<br/>
that hematologic remission can occur while neurological<br/>
manifestations progress.</p><p>Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral<br/>
and parenteral administration of folic acid. You should call<br/>
your doctor for medical advice about serious adverse events.<br/>

<span class="Bold">seal is broken or missing.</span></p><p class="First">* This product is a prescription-folate with or without other dietary in-<br/>
gredients that – due to increased folate levels (AUG 2 1973 FR 20750),<br/>
requires an Rx on the label because of increased risk associated with<br/>
masking of B12 deficiency (pernicious anemia). Based on our assess-<br/>
ment of the risk of obscuring pernicious anemia, this product requires<br/>
licensed medical supervision, an Rx status, and a National Drug Code<br/>
(NDC) – or similarly-formatted product code, as required by pedigree<br/>
reporting requirements and supply-chain control as well as – in some<br/>
cases, for insurance-reimbursement applications.</p><h2>Package Label</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NDC# 72380-915-10</span></p><p><span class="Bold">VIVERA™</span><br/>
