This medicine is used when the atrial fibrillation is not caused by a heart valve problem.</p><p>Pradaxa is also used after hip replacement surgery to prevent a type of blood clot called deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism).</p><p>Pradaxa is also used to treat DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE), and to lower your risk of having a repeat DVT or PE.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Pradaxa can cause you to bleed more easily. <b>Call your doctor at once if you have:</b> bleeding gums, nosebleeds, heavy menstrual periods or abnormal vaginal bleeding, blood in your urine, bloody or tarry stools, coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.</p><p>Many other drugs can increase your risk of bleeding when used with dabigatran. Tell your doctor about all medicines you have recently used.</p><p>Pradaxa can cause a very serious blood clot around your spinal cord if you undergo a spinal tap or receive spinal anesthesia (epidural), especially if you have a genetic spinal defect, if you have a spinal catheter in place, if you have a history of spinal surgery or repeated spinal taps, or if you are also using other drugs that can affect blood clotting. This type of blood clot can lead to long-term or permanent paralysis.</p><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>symptoms of a spinal cord blood clot</b> such as back pain, numbness or muscle weakness in your lower body, or loss of bladder or bowel control.</p><p><b>Do not stop taking Pradaxa without first talking to your doctor. Stopping suddenly can increase your risk of blood clot or stroke.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not take Pradaxa if you are allergic to dabigatran, or if you have:</p><ul>
