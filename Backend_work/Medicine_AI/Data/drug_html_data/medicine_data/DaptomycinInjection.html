The dosage regimen for daptomycin for injection in pediatric patients with renal impairment has not been established. <span class="Bold"><br/>
<br/></span></p><h3>Preparation and Administration of Daptomycin for Injection</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">There are two formulations of daptomycin that have differences concerning storage and reconstitution. Carefully follow the reconstitution and storage procedures in labeling.</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Reconstitution of Daptomycin for Injection Vial</span><br/>
Daptomycin for injection is supplied in single-dose vials, each containing 500 mg daptomycin as a sterile, lyophilized cake or powder. The contents of a daptomycin for injection vial should be reconstituted, using aseptic technique, to 50 mg/mL as follows:<br/>
1. To minimize foaming, AVOID vigorous agitation or shaking of the vial during or after reconstitution.<br/>
2. Remove the polypropylene flip-off cap from the daptomycin for injection vial to expose the central portion of the rubber stopper.<br/>
3. Wipe the top of the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab or other antiseptic solution and allow to dry. After cleaning, do not touch the rubber stopper or allow it to touch any other surface.<br/>
4. Slowly transfer 10 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection through the center of the rubber stopper into the daptomycin for injection vial, pointing the transfer needle toward the wall of the vial. It is recommended that a beveled sterile transfer needle that is 21 gauge or smaller in diameter, or a needleless device is used, pointing the transfer needle toward the wall of the vial.<br/>
5. Ensure that all of the daptomycin for injection cake or powder is wetted by gently rotating the vial.<br/>
   1. Allow the wetted product to stand undisturbed for 10 minutes.<br/>
   2. Gently rotate or swirl the vial contents for a few minutes, as needed, to obtain a completely reconstituted solution.</p><p><span class="Bold">Administration Instructions</span></p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration.<br/>
Slowly remove reconstituted liquid (50 mg daptomycin/mL) from the vial using a beveled sterile needle that is 21 gauge or smaller in diameter. Administer as an intravenous injection or infusion as described below:</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Intravenous Injection over a period of 2 minutes</span><br/>
• For intravenous (IV) injection over a period of 2 minutes in adult patients <span class="Bold">only</span>: Administer the appropriate volume of the reconstituted daptomycin for injection (concentration of 50 mg/mL).<br/>
<span class="Italics">Intravenous Infusion over a period of 30 minutes</span><br/>
• For IV infusion over a period of 30 minutes in adult patients: The appropriate volume of the reconstituted daptomycin for injection (concentration of 50 mg/mL) should be further diluted, using aseptic technique, into a 50 mL IV infusion bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride injection.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients (1 to 17 Years of Age)</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Intravenous Infusion over a period of 30 or 60 minutes</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">• Unlike in Adults, do NOT administer daptomycin by injection over a two (2) minute period to pediatric patients</span> <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].</span><br/>
• <span class="Italics">For Intravenous infusion over a period of 60 minutes in pediatric patients 1 to 6 years of age</span>: The appropriate volume of the reconstituted daptomycin for injection (concentration of 50 mg/mL) should be further diluted, using aseptic technique, into an intravenous infusion bag containing 25 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection. The infusion rate should be maintained at 0.42 mL/minute over the 60-minute period.<br/>
• <span class="Italics">For Intravenous infusion over a period of 30 minutes in pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age</span>: The appropriate volume of the reconstituted daptomycin for injection (concentration of 50 mg/mL) should be further diluted, using aseptic technique, into a 50 mL IV infusion bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride injection. The infusion rate should be maintained at 1.67 mL/minute over the 30-minute period.</p><p>No preservative or bacteriostatic agent is present in this product. Aseptic technique must be used in the preparation of final IV solution. Do not exceed the In-Use storage conditions of the reconstituted and diluted solutions of daptomycin for injection described below. Discard unused portions of daptomycin for injection.</p><p><span class="Bold">In-Use Storage Conditions for Daptomycin for Injection Once Reconstituted in Acceptable Intravenous Diluents</span><br/>
Stability studies have shown that the reconstituted solution is stable in the vial for 12 hours at room temperature and up to 48 hours if stored under refrigeration at 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F).</p><p>The diluted solution is stable in the infusion bag for 12 hours at room temperature and 48 hours if stored under refrigeration. The combined storage time (reconstituted solution in vial and diluted solution in infusion bag) should not exceed 12 hours at room temperature or 48 hours under refrigeration.</p><h3>Compatible Intravenous Solutions</h3><p class="First">Daptomycin for injection is compatible with 0.9% sodium chloride injection and lactated Ringer's injection.</p><h3>Incompatibilities</h3><p class="First">Daptomycin for injection is not compatible with dextrose-containing diluents.</p><p>Daptomycin for injection should not be used in conjunction with ReadyMED<span class="Sup">®</span> elastomeric infusion pumps. Stability studies of daptomycin for injection solutions stored in ReadyMED<span class="Sup">®</span> elastomeric infusion pumps identified an impurity (2-mercaptobenzothiazole) leaching from this pump system into the daptomycin for injection solution.</p><p>Because only limited data are available on the compatibility of daptomycin for injection with other IV substances, additives and other medications should not be added to daptomycin for injection single-dose vials or infusion bags, or infused simultaneously with daptomycin for injection through the same IV line. If the same IV line is used for sequential infusion of different drugs, the line should be flushed with a compatible intravenous solution before and after infusion with daptomycin for injection.</p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS &amp; STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First">Daptomycin for Injection: 500 mg daptomycin as a sterile, pale yellow to light brown lyophilized powder for reconstitution in a single-dose vial.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Daptomycin for injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to daptomycin.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of antibacterial agents, including daptomycin for injection, and may be life-threatening. If an allergic reaction to daptomycin for injection occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis</h3><p class="First">Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), has been reported with the use of daptomycin for injection. Rhabdomyolysis, with or without acute renal failure, has been reported <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p>Patients receiving daptomycin for injection should be monitored for the development of muscle pain or weakness, particularly of the distal extremities. In patients who receive daptomycin for injection, CPK levels should be monitored weekly, and more frequently in patients who received recent prior or concomitant therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or in whom elevations in CPK occur during treatment with daptomycin for injection.</p><p>In adult patients with renal impairment, both renal function and CPK should be monitored more frequently than once weekly <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>In Phase 1 studies and Phase 2 clinical trials in adults, CPK elevations appeared to be more frequent when daptomycin for injection was dosed more than once daily. Therefore, daptomycin for injection should not be dosed more frequently than once a day.</p><p>Daptomycin for injection should be discontinued in patients with unexplained signs and symptoms of myopathy in conjunction with CPK elevations to levels &gt;1,000 U/L (~5× ULN), and in patients without reported symptoms who have marked elevations in CPK, with levels &gt;2,000 U/L (≥10× ULN). In addition, consideration should be given to suspending agents associated with rhabdomyolysis, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, temporarily in patients receiving daptomycin for injection <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Eosinophilic Pneumonia</h3><p class="First">Eosinophilic pneumonia has been reported in patients receiving daptomycin for injection <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. In reported cases associated with daptomycin for injection, patients developed fever, dyspnea with hypoxic respiratory insufficiency, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates or organizing pneumonia. In general, patients developed eosinophilic pneumonia 2 to 4 weeks after starting daptomycin for injection and improved when daptomycin for injection was discontinued and steroid therapy was initiated. Recurrence of eosinophilic pneumonia upon re-exposure has been reported. Patients who develop these signs and symptoms while receiving daptomycin for injection should undergo prompt medical evaluation, and daptomycin for injection should be discontinued immediately. Treatment with systemic steroids is recommended.</p><h3>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)</h3><p class="First">DRESS has been reported in post-marketing experience with daptomycin for injection <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. Patients who develop skin rash, fever, peripheral eosinophilia, and systemic organ (for example, hepatic, renal, pulmonary) impairment while receiving daptomycin for injection should undergo medical evaluation. If <span class="following_xmChange">DRESS</span> is suspected, discontinue daptomycin for injection promptly and institute appropriate treatment.</p><h3>Tubulointerstitial Nephritis (TIN)</h3><p class="First">TIN has been reported in post-marketing experience with daptomycin for injection <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. Patients who develop new or worsening renal impairment while receiving daptomycin for injection should undergo medical evaluation. If TIN is suspected, discontinue daptomycin for injection promptly and institute appropriate <span class="following_xmChange">treatment</span>.</p><h3>Peripheral Neuropathy</h3><p class="First">Cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported during the daptomycin for injection postmarketing experience <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. Therefore, physicians should be alert to signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving daptomycin for injection. Monitor for neuropathy and consider discontinuation.</p><h3>Potential Nervous System and/or Muscular System Effects in Pediatric Patients Younger than 12 Months</h3><p class="First">Avoid use of daptomycin for injection in pediatric patients younger than 12 months due to the risk of potential effects on muscular, neuromuscular, and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or central) observed in neonatal dogs with intravenous daptomycin <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Clostridioides difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridioides difficile</span>–associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with the use of nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including daptomycin for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, since these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.<br/>
<br/>
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Persisting or Relapsing S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis</h3><p class="First">Patients with persisting or relapsing <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> bacteremia/endocarditis or poor clinical response should have repeat blood cultures. If a blood culture is positive for <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span>, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) susceptibility testing of the isolate should be performed using a standardized procedure, and diagnostic evaluation of the patient should be performed to rule out sequestered foci of infection. Appropriate surgical intervention (e.g., debridement, removal of prosthetic devices, valve replacement surgery) and/or consideration of a change in antibacterial regimen may be required.</p><p>Failure of treatment due to persisting or relapsing <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> bacteremia/endocarditis may be due to reduced daptomycin susceptibility (as evidenced by increasing MIC of the <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> isolate) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Decreased Efficacy in Patients with Moderate Baseline Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Limited data are available from the two Phase 3 complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) trials regarding clinical efficacy of daptomycin for injection treatment in adult patients with creatinine clearance (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> ) &lt;50 mL/min; only 31/534 (6%) patients treated with daptomycin for injection in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population had a baseline CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> &lt;50 mL/min. Table 4 shows the number of adult patients by renal function and treatment group who were clinical successes in the Phase 3 cSSSI trials.<br/>

<span class="Bold">Table 4: Clinical Success Rates by Renal Function and Treatment Group in Phase 3 cSSSI Trials in Adult Patients (Population: ITT)</span></p><p>In a subgroup analysis of the ITT population in the Phase 3 <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> bacteremia/endocarditis trial, clinical success rates, as determined by a treatment-blinded Adjudication Committee <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>, in the daptomycin for injection-treated adult patients were lower in patients with baseline CL<span class="Sub">CR</span>&lt;50 mL/min (see Table 5). A decrease of the magnitude shown in Table 5 was not observed in comparator-treated patients.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Table 5: Adjudication Committee Clinical Success Rates at Test of Cure by Baseline Creatinine Clearance and Treatment Subgroup in the <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> Bacteremia/Endocarditis Trial in Adult Patients (Population: ITT)<br/></span></p><p>Consider these data when selecting antibacterial therapy for use in adult patients with baseline moderate to severe renal impairment.</p><h3>Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">Clinically relevant plasma concentrations of daptomycin have been observed to cause a significant concentration-dependent false prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and elevation of International Normalized Ratio (INR) when certain recombinant thromboplastin reagents are utilized for the assay <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Non-Susceptible Microorganisms</h3><p class="First">The use of antibacterials may promote the overgrowth of non-susceptible microorganisms. If these infections occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.<br/>
Prescribing daptomycin for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:<br/>

In Phase 3 trials of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adult patients, the death rate and rates of serious cardiorespiratory adverse events were higher in daptomycin for injection-treated patients than in comparator-treated patients. These differences were due to lack of therapeutic effectiveness of daptomycin for injection in the treatment of CAP in patients experiencing these adverse events <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.4)]</span>.<br/>

In Phase 3 cSSSI trials of adult patients receiving daptomycin for injection at a dose of 4 mg/kg, elevations in CPK were reported as clinical adverse events in 15/534 (2.8%) daptomycin for injection-treated patients, compared with 10/558 (1.8%) comparator-treated patients. Of the 534 patients treated with daptomycin for injection, 1 (0.2%) had symptoms of muscle pain or weakness associated with CPK elevations to greater than 4 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The symptoms resolved within 3 days and CPK returned to normal within 7 to 10 days after treatment was discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.

Steady-state trough concentrations were achieved by the third daily dose. The mean (SD) steady-state trough concentrations attained following the administration of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg q24h were 5.9 (1.6), 6.7 (1.6), 10.3 (5.5), 12.9 (2.9), and 13.7 (5.2) mcg/mL, respectively. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Daptomycin for Injection Administered over a 2-Minute Period in Adults </span><br/>
Following IV administration of daptomycin for injection over a 2-minute period to healthy adult volunteers at doses of 4 mg/kg (N=8) and 6 mg/kg (N=12), the mean (SD) steady-state systemic exposure (AUC) values were 475 (71) and 701 (82) mcg•h/mL, respectively. Values for maximum plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) at the end of the 2-minute period could not be determined adequately in this study. However, using pharmacokinetic parameters from 14 healthy adult volunteers who received a single dose of daptomycin for injection 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 30-minute period in a separate study, steady-state C<span class="Sub">max</span> values were simulated for daptomycin for injection 4 and 6 mg/kg IV administered over a 2-minute period. The simulated mean (SD) steady-state C<span class="Sub">max</span> values were 77.7 (8.1) and 116.6 (12.2) mcg/mL, respectively. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Distribution</span> <br/>
Daptomycin is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin, in a concentration-independent manner. The overall mean binding ranges from 90 to 93%. <br/>
<br/>
In clinical studies, mean serum protein binding in adult subjects with creatinine clearance (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span>) ≥30 mL/min was comparable to that observed in healthy adult subjects with normal renal function. However, there was a trend toward decreasing serum protein binding among subjects with CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> &lt;30 mL/min (88%), including those receiving hemodialysis (86%) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (84%). The protein binding of daptomycin in adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) was similar to that in healthy adult subjects.<br/>
<br/>
The volume of distribution at steady-state (V<span class="Sub">ss</span>) of daptomycin in healthy adult subjects was approximately 0.1 L/kg and was independent of dose. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Metabolism</span> <br/>
In <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies, daptomycin was not metabolized by human liver microsomes. <br/>
<br/>
In 5 healthy adults after infusion of radiolabeled <span class="Sup">14</span>C-daptomycin, the plasma total radioactivity was similar to the concentration determined by microbiological assay. Inactive metabolites were detected in urine, as determined by the difference between total radioactive concentrations and microbiologically active concentrations. In a separate study, no metabolites were observed in plasma on Day 1 following the administration of daptomycin for injection at 6 mg/kg to adult subjects. Minor amounts of three oxidative metabolites and one unidentified compound were detected in urine. The site of metabolism has not been identified. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Excretion</span> <br/>
Daptomycin is excreted primarily by the kidneys. In a mass balance study of 5 healthy adult subjects using radiolabeled daptomycin, approximately 78% of the administered dose was recovered from urine based on total radioactivity (approximately 52% of the dose based on microbiologically active concentrations), and 5.7% of the administered dose was recovered from feces (collected for up to 9 days) based on total radioactivity. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span> <br/>
<span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span> <br/>
<br/>
Population-derived pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for infected adult patients (complicated skin and skin structure infections [cSSSI] and <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> bacteremia) and noninfected adult subjects with various degrees of renal function (Table 12). Total plasma clearance (CL<span class="Sub">T</span>), elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>), and volume of distribution at steady-state (V<span class="Sub">ss</span>) in patients with cSSSI were similar to those in patients with <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> bacteremia. Following administration of daptomycin for injection 4 mg/kg q24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean CL<span class="Sub">T</span> was 9%, 22%, and 46% lower among subjects and patients with mild (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> 30 to &lt;50 mL/min), and severe (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> &lt;30 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively, than in those with normal renal function (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> &gt;80 mL/min). The mean steady-state systemic exposure (AUC), t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>, and V<span class="Sub">ss</span> increased with decreasing renal function, although the mean AUC for patients with CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> 30 to 80 mL/min was not markedly different from the mean AUC for patients with normal renal function. The mean AUC for patients with CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> &lt;30 mL/min and for patients on dialysis (CAPD and hemodialysis dosed post-dialysis) was approximately 2 and 3 times higher, respectively, than for patients with normal renal function. The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> ranged from 60 to 70 mcg/mL in patients with CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> ≥30 mL/min, while the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> for patients with CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> &lt;30 mL/min ranged from 41 to 58 mcg/mL. After administration of daptomycin for injection 6 mg/kg q24h by IV infusion over a 30-minute period, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> ranged from 80 to 114 mcg/mL in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and was similar to that of patients with normal renal function.<br/>

The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin were evaluated in 6 moderately obese (Body Mass Index [BMI] 25 to 39.9 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) and 6 extremely obese (BMI ≥40 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) adult subjects and controls matched for age, gender, and renal function. Following administration of daptomycin for injection by IV infusion over a 30-minute period as a single 4 mg/kg dose based on total body weight, the total plasma clearance of daptomycin normalized to total body weight was approximately 15% lower in moderately obese subjects and 23% lower in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> of daptomycin was approximately 30% higher in moderately obese subjects and 31% higher in extremely obese subjects than in nonobese controls. The differences were most likely due to differences in the renal clearance of daptomycin. No adjustment of daptomycin for injection dosage is warranted in obese patients. </p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric</span><br/>
The pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric subjects was evaluated in 3 single-dose pharmacokinetic studies. In general, body weight-normalized total body clearance in pediatric patients was higher than in adults and increased with a decrease of age, whereas elimination half-life tends to decrease with a decrease of age. Body weight-normalized total body clearance and elimination half-life of daptomycin in children 2 to 6 years of age were similar at different doses.</p><p>A study was conducted to assess safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric patients (1 to 17 years old, inclusive) with cSSSI caused by Grampositive pathogens.

Daptomycin has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro spectrum of activity of daptomycin encompasses most clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria.</p><p>Daptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro. This has been demonstrated both by time-kill curves and by MBC/MIC (minimum bactericidal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratios using broth dilution methodology. Daptomycin maintained bactericidal activity <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> against stationary phase <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> in simulated endocardial vegetations. The clinical significance of this is not known.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span><br/>
Daptomycin binds to bacterial cell membranes and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. This loss of membrane potential causes inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death.</p><p><span class="Bold">Resistance</span><br/>
The mechanism(s) of daptomycin resistance is not fully understood. Currently, there are no known transferable elements that confer resistance to daptomycin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Interactions with Other Antibacterials</span><br/>

However, neither mutagenic nor clastogenic potential was found in a battery of genotoxicity tests, including the Ames assay, a mammalian cell gene mutation assay, a test for chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells, an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus assay, an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> DNA repair assay, and an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> sister chromatid exchange assay in Chinese hamsters.</p><p>Daptomycin did not affect the fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats when administered intravenously at doses of 25, 75, or 150 mg/kg/day, which is approximately up to 9 times the estimated human exposure level based upon AUCs (or approximately up to 4 times the recommended human dose of 6 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison).</p><h3>Animal Pharmacology &amp; OR Toxicology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adult Animals</span><br/>
In animals, daptomycin administration has been associated with effects on skeletal muscle. However, there were no changes in cardiac or smooth muscle. Skeletal muscle effects were characterized by microscopic degenerative/regenerative changes and variable elevations in creatine phosphokinase (CPK). No fibrosis or rhabdomyolysis was evident in repeat-dose studies up to the highest doses tested in rats (150 mg/kg/day) and dogs (100 mg/kg/day). The degree of skeletal myopathy showed no increase when treatment was extended from 1 month to up to 6 months. Severity was dose-dependent. All muscle effects, including microscopic changes, were fully reversible within 30 days following the cessation of dosing.</p><p>In adult animals, effects on peripheral nerve (characterized by axonal degeneration and frequently accompanied by significant losses of patellar reflex, gag reflex, and pain perception) were observed at daptomycin doses higher than those associated with skeletal myopathy. Deficits in the dogs' patellar reflexes were seen within 2 weeks after the start of treatment at 40 mg/kg/day (9 times the human C<span class="Sub">max</span> at the 6 mg/kg/day dose), with some clinical improvement noted within 2 weeks after the cessation of dosing. However, at 75 mg/kg/day for 1 month, 7 of 8 dogs failed to regain full patellar reflex responses within a 3-month recovery period. In a separate study in dogs receiving doses of 75 and 100 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, minimal residual histological changes were noted at 6 months after the cessation of dosing. However, recovery of peripheral nerve function was evident.</p><p>Tissue distribution studies in rats showed that daptomycin is retained in the kidney but appears to penetrate the blood-brain barrier only minimally following single and multiple doses.</p><p><span class="Bold">Juvenile Animals</span><br/>
Target organs of daptomycin-related effects in 7-week-old juvenile dogs were skeletal muscle and nerve, the same target organs as in adult dogs. In juvenile dogs, nerve effects were noted at lower daptomycin blood concentrations than in adult dogs following 28 days of dosing. In contrast to adult dogs, juvenile dogs also showed evidence of effects in nerves of the spinal cord as well as peripheral nerves after 28 days of dosing. No nerve effects were noted in juvenile dogs following 14 days of dosing at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day.</p><p>Administration of daptomycin to 7-week-old juvenile dogs for 28 days at doses of 50 mg/kg/day produced minimal degenerative effects on the peripheral nerve and spinal cord in several animals, with no corresponding clinical signs. A dose of 150 mg/kg/day for 28 days produced minimal degeneration in the peripheral nerve and spinal cord as well as minimal to mild degeneration of the skeletal muscle in a majority of animals, accompanied by slight to severe muscle weakness evident in most dogs. Following a 28-day recovery phase, microscopic examination revealed recovery of the skeletal muscle and the ulnar nerve effects, but nerve degeneration in the sciatic nerve and spinal cord was still observed in all 150 mg/kg/day dogs.</p><p>Following once-daily administration of daptomycin to juvenile dogs for 28 days, microscopic effects in nerve tissue were noted at a C<span class="Sub">max</span> value of 417 mcg/mL, which is approximately 3-fold less than the C<span class="Sub">max</span> value associated with nerve effects in adult dogs treated once daily with daptomycin for 28 days (1308 mcg/mL).</p><p><span class="Bold">Neonatal Animals</span><br/>
Neonatal dogs (4 to 31 days old) were more sensitive to daptomycin-related adverse nervous system and/or muscular system effects than either juvenile or adult dogs. In neonatal dogs, adverse nervous system and/or muscular system effects were associated with a C<span class="Sub">max</span> value approximately 3-fold less than the C<span class="Sub">max</span> in juvenile dogs, and 9-fold less than the C<span class="Sub">max</span> in adult dogs following 28 days of dosing. At a dose of 25 mg/kg/day with associated C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span> values of 147 mcg/mL and 717 mcg•h/mL, respectively (1.6 and 1.0-fold the adult human C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC, respectively, at the 6 mg/kg/day dose), mild clinical signs o f twitching and one incidence of muscle rigidity were observed with no corresponding effect on body weight. These effects were found to be reversible within 28 days after treatment had stopped.</p><p>At higher dose levels of 50 and 75 mg/kg/day with associated C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span> values of ≥321 mcg/mL and ≥1470 mcg•h/mL, respectively, marked clinical signs of twitching, muscle rigidity in the limbs, and impaired use of limbs were observed. Resulting decreases in body weights and overall body condition at doses ≥50 mg/kg/day necessitated early discontinuation by postnatal day (PND) 19.</p><p>Histopathological assessment did not reveal any daptomycin-related changes in the peripheral and central nervous system tissue, as well as in the skeletal muscle or other tissues assessed, at any dose level.</p><p>No adverse effects were observed in the dogs that received daptomycin at 10 mg/kg/day, the NOAEL, with associated C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span> values of 62 mcg/mL and 247 mcg•h/mL, respectively (or 0.6 and 0.4-fold the adult human C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC, respectively at the 6 mg/kg dose).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults with cSSSI</span><br/>
Adult patients with clinically documented complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) (Table 15) were enrolled in two randomized, multinational, multicenter, investigator-blinded trials comparing daptomycin for injection (4 mg/kg IV q24h) with either vancomycin (1 g IV q12h) or an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin (i.e., nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, or flucloxacillin; 4 to 12 g IV per day). Patients could switch to oral therapy after a minimum of 4 days of IV treatment if clinical improvement was demonstrated. Patients known to have bacteremia at baseline were excluded. Patients with creatinine clearance (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span>) between 30 and 70  mL/min were to receive a lower dose of daptomycin for injection as specified in the protocol; however, the majority of patients in this subpopulation did not have the dose of daptomycin for injection adjusted.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 15: Investigator's Primary Diagnosis in the cSSSI Trials in Adult Patients (Population: ITT)</span></p><p>*Comparator: vancomycin (1 g IV q12h) or an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin (i.e., nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, or flucloxacillin; 4 to 12 g/day IV in divided doses).<br/>

The cSSSI pediatric trial was a single prospective multi-center, randomized, comparative trial. A total of 396 pediatric patients aged 1 to 17 years with cSSSI caused by Gram positive pathogens were enrolled into the study. Patients known to have bacteremia, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and pneumonia at baseline were excluded. Patients were enrolled in a stepwise approach into four age groups and given age-dependent doses of daptomycin for injection once daily for up to 14 days. The different age groups and doses evaluated were as follows: Adolescents (12 to 17 years) treated with 5 mg/kg of daptomycin for injection (n=113), Children (7 to 11 years) treated with 7 mg/kg of daptomycin for injection (n=113), Children (2 to 6 years) treated with 9 mg/kg of daptomycin for injection (n=125) and Infants (1 to &lt;2 years) treated with 10mg/kg (n = 45).</p><p>Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive daptomycin for injection or a standard of care (SOC) comparator, which included intravenous therapy with either vancomycin, clindamycin, or an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin (nafcillin, oxacillin, or cloxacillin). Patients could switch to oral therapy after clinical improvement was demonstrated (no minimum IV dosing was required)</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of daptomycin for injection. The clinical outcome was determined by resolution or improvement of symptoms at the End-of-Treatment (EOT), 3 days after the last dose, and Test-of-Cure (TOC), 7 to14 days after the last dose. Investigator observed outcomes were verified in a blinded fashion. Of the 396 subjects randomized in the study, 389 subjects were treated with daptomycin for injection or comparator and included in the ITT population. Of these, 257 subjects were randomized to the daptomycin for injection group and 132 subjects were randomized to the comparator group. Approximately 95% of subjects switched to oral therapy. The mean day of switch was day 4, and ranged from day 1 to day 14. The clinical success rates determined at 7 to 14 days after last dose of therapy (IV and oral) (TOC visit) were 88% (227/257) for daptomycin for injection and 86% (114/132) for comparator. <span class="Bold"><br/></span></p><h3>S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults with <span class="Italics">S.aureus</span> Bacteremia/Endocarditis</span><br/>
The efficacy of daptomycin for injection in the treatment of adult patients with <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> bacteremia was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, multinational, multicenter, open-label trial. In this trial, adult patients with at least one positive blood culture for <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> obtained within 2 calendar days prior to the first dose of study drug and irrespective of source were enrolled and randomized to either daptomycin for injection (6 mg/kg IV q24h) or standard of care [an anti-staphylococcal semisynthetic penicillin 2 g IV q4h (nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, or flucloxacillin) or vancomycin 1 g IV q12h, each with initial gentamicin 1 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for first 4 days]. Of the patients in the comparator group, 93% received initial gentamicin for a median of 4 days, compared with 1 patient (&lt;1%) in the daptomycin for injection group. Patients with prosthetic heart valves, intravascular foreign material that was not planned for removal within 4 days after the first dose of study medication, severe neutropenia, known osteomyelitis, polymicrobial bloodstream infections, creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min, and pneumonia were excluded.</p><p>Upon entry, patients were classified for likelihood of endocarditis using the modified Duke criteria (Possible, Definite, or Not Endocarditis). Echocardiography, including a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), was performed within 5 days following study enrollment. The choice of comparator agent was based on the oxacillin susceptibility of the <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> isolate. The duration of study treatment was based on the investigator's clinical diagnosis. Final diagnoses and outcome assessments at Test of Cure (6 weeks after the last treatment dose) were made by a treatment-blinded Adjudication Committee, using protocol-specified clinical definitions and a composite primary efficacy endpoint (clinical and microbiological success) at the Test of Cure visit.</p><p>A total of 246 patients ≥18 years of age (124 daptomycin for injection, 122 comparator) with <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> bacteremia were randomized from 48 centers in the US and Europe. In the ITT population, 120 patients received daptomycin for injection and 115 received comparator (62 received an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin and 53 received vancomycin). Thirty-five patients treated with an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin received vancomycin initially for 1 to 3 days, pending final susceptibility results for the <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> isolates. The median age among the 235 patients in the ITT population was 53 years (range: 21 to 91 years); 30/120 (25%) in the daptomycin for injection group and 37/115 (32%) in the comparator group were ≥65 years of age. Of the 235 ITT patients, there were 141 (60%) males and 156 (66%) Caucasians across the two treatment groups. In addition, 176 (75%) of the ITT population had systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) at baseline and 85 (36%) had surgical procedures within 30 days prior to onset of the <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> bacteremia. Eighty-nine patients (38%) had bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> (MRSA). Entry diagnosis was based on the modified Duke criteria and comprised 37 (16%) Definite, 144 (61%) Possible, and 54 (23%) Not Endocarditis. Of the 37 patients with an entry diagnosis of Definite Endocarditis, all (100%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis, and of the 144 patients with an entry diagnosis of Possible Endocarditis, 15 (10%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis as assessed by the Adjudication Committee. Of the 54 patients with an entry diagnosis of Not Endocarditis, 1 (2%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis as assessed by the Adjudication Committee.</p><p>In the ITT population, there were 182 patients with bacteremia and 53 patients with infective endocarditis as assessed by the Adjudication Committee, including 35 with right-sided endocarditis and 18 with left-sided endocarditis. The 182 patients with bacteremia comprised 121 with complicated <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> bacteremia and 61 with uncomplicated <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> bacteremia.</p><p>Complicated bacteremia was defined as <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> isolated from blood cultures obtained on at least 2 different calendar days, and/or metastatic foci of infection (deep tissue involvement), and classification of the patient as not having endocarditis according to the modified Duke criteria. Uncomplicated bacteremia was defined as <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> isolated from blood culture(s) obtained on a single calendar day, no metastatic foci of infection, no infection of prosthetic material, and classification of the patient as not having endocarditis according to the modified Duke criteria. The definition of right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) used in the clinical trial was Definite or Possible Endocarditis according to the modified Duke criteria and no echocardiographic evidence of predisposing pathology or active involvement of either the mitral or aortic valve. Complicated RIE comprised patients who were not intravenous drug users, had a positive blood culture for MRSA, serum creatinine ≥2.5 mg/dL, or evidence of extrapulmonary sites of infection.

The pediatric <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> bacteremia study was designed as a prospective multi-center, randomized, comparative trial to treat pediatric patients aged 1 to 17 years with bacteremia. Patients known to have endocarditis or pneumonia at baseline were excluded. Patients were enrolled in a stepwise approach into three age groups and given age-dependent doses of daptomycin for injection once daily for up to 42 days. The different age groups and doses evaluated were as follows: Adolescents (12 to 17 years, n=14 patients) treated with daptomycin for injection dosed at 7 mg/kg once daily, Children (7 to 11 years, n=19 patients) treated with daptomycin for injection dosed at 9 mg/kg once daily and Children (2 to 6 years, n=22 patients) treated with daptomycin for injection dosed at 12 mg/kg once daily. No patients 1 to &lt;2 years of age were enrolled.</p><p>Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive daptomycin for injection or a standard of care comparator, which included intravenous therapy with vancomycin, semisynthetic penicillin, first generation cephalosporin or clindamycin. Patients could switch to oral therapy after clinical improvement was demonstrated (no minimum IV dosing was required).</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety of daptomycin for injection. The clinical outcome was determined by resolution or improvement of symptoms at test-of-cure (TOC) visit, 7 to 14 days after the last dose, which was assessed by the site level Blinded Evaluator.</p><p>Of the 82 subjects randomized in the study, 81 subjects were treated with daptomycin for injection or comparator and included in the safety population, and 73 had a proven <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> bacteremia at Baseline. Of these, 51 subjects were randomized to the daptomycin for injection group and 22 subjects were randomized to the comparator group. The mean duration of IV therapy was 12 days, with a range of 1 to 44 days. Forty-eight subjects switched to oral therapy, and the mean duration of oral therapy was 21 days. The clinical success rates determined at 7 to 14 days after last dose of therapy (IV and oral) (TOC visit) were 88% (45/51) for daptomycin for injection and 77% (17/22) for comparator.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">1.

Store original packages at refrigerated temperatures, 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F); avoid excessive heat <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].</span></p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">Advise patients that allergic reactions, including serious allergic reactions, could occur and that serious reactions require immediate treatment. Patients should report any previous allergic reactions to daptomycin. <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4, 5.5).]</span><br/>
<br/>
Advise patients to report muscle pain or weakness, especially in the forearms and lower legs, as well as tingling or numbness. <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6).]</span><br/>
<br/>
Advise patients to report any symptoms of cough, breathlessness, or fever. <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.3).]</span><br/>
<br/>
Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials that usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever), even as late as 2 or more months after having received the last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.8).]</span><br/>
<br/>
Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs, including daptomycin for injection, should be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When daptomycin for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be administered exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by daptomycin for injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Manufactured by:<br/>
