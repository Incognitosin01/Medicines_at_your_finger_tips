Clobetasol, an analog of prednisolone, has a high degree of glucocorticoid activity and a slight degree of mineralocorticoid activity.</p><p>Chemically, clobetasol propionate is (11ß,16ß)-21-chloro-9- fluoro-11-hydroxy-16-methyl-17-(1-oxopropoxy)-pregna-1,4- diene-3,20-dione, and it has the following structural formula:</p><p></p><p>Clobetasol propionate has the molecular formula C <span class="Sub">25</span>H <span class="Sub">32</span>CIFO <span class="Sub">5</span> and a molecular weight of 467. It is a white to cream-colored crystalline powder insoluble in water.</p><p>Clobetasol propionate cream contains clobetasol propionate 0.5 mg/g in a cream base composed of cetyl alcohol, citric acid, glycol stearate, lanolin oil, methylparaben, PEG-8 stearate, polysorbate 60, propylene glycol, propylparaben, purified water, sodium citrate, stearyl alcohol, and white petrolatum. Sodium hydroxide may be used to adjust pH.</p><h2>Clobetex - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Like other topical corticosteroids, clobetasol propionate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A <span class="Sub">2</span> inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A <span class="Sub">2</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressing with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours has not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption.</p><p>Studies performed with clobetasol propionate cream indicate that it is in the super-high range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Clobetex</h2><p class="First">Clobetasol propionate cream is a super-high potency corticosteroid formulation indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. Treatment beyond 2 consecutive weeks is not recommended, and the total dosage should not exceed 50 g/week because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamicpituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis. Use in pediatric patients under 12 years of age is not recommended.</p><p>As with other highly active corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control has been achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of the diagnosis may be necessary.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Clobetasol Propionate Cream, USP, 0.05% is contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the preparations.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Clobetasol propionate cream should not be used in the treatment of rosacea or perioral dermatitis, and should not be used on the face, groin, or axillae.</p><p>Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal from treatment. Manifestations of Cushing syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on therapy.</p><p>Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. Patients receiving super-potent corticosteroids should not be treated for more than 2 weeks at a time, and only small areas should be treated at any one time due to the increased risk of HPA suppression.</p><p>Clobetasol propionate cream produced HPA axis suppression when used at doses as low as 2 g/day for 1 week in patients with eczema.</p><p>If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur that require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products.</p><p>Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use).</p><p>If irritation develops, clobetasol propionate cream should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a <span class="Italics">failure to heal</span> rather than noting a clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.</p><p>If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of clobetasol propionate cream should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression:</p><ul>
<li>ACTH stimulation test</li>
<li>A.M. plasma cortisol test</li>
<li>Urinary free cortisol test</li>
</ul><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of clobetasol propionate.</p><p>Studies in the rat following subcutaneous administration at dosage levels up to 50 mcg/kg/day revealed that the females exhibited an increase in the number of resorbed embryos and a decrease in the number of living fetuses at the highest dose.</p><p>Clobetasol propionate was nonmutagenic in 3 different test systems: the Ames test, the <span class="Italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> gene conversion assay, and the <span class="Italics">E. coli</span> B WP2 fluctuation test.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application to laboratory animals.</p><p>Clobetasol propionate has not been tested for teratogenicity when applied topically; however, it is absorbed percutaneously, and when administered subcutaneously it was a significant teratogen in both the rabbit and mouse. Clobetasol propionate has greater teratogenic potential than steroids that are less potent.</p><p>Teratogenicity studies in mice using the subcutaneous route resulted in fetotoxicity at the highest dose tested (1 mg/kg) and teratogenicity at all dose levels tested down to 0.03 mg/kg. These doses are approximately 1.4 and 0.04 times, respectively, the human topical dose of clobetasol propionate cream and ointment. Abnormalities seen included cleft palate and skeletal abnormalities.</p><p>In rabbits, clobetasol propionate was teratogenic at doses of 3 and 10 mcg/kg. These doses are approximately 0.02 and 0.05 times, respectively, the human topical dose of clobetasol propionate cream and ointment. Abnormalities seen included cleft palate, cranioschisis, and other skeletal abnormalities.</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of the teratogenic potential of clobetasol propionate in pregnant women. Clobetasol propionate cream should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when clobetasol propionate cream is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of clobetasol propionate cream in pediatric patients have not been established. Use in pediatric patients under 12 years of age is not recommended. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression and Cushing syndrome when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of adrenal insufficiency during or after withdrawal of treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children.</p><p>HPA axis suppression, Cushing syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include low plasma cortisol levels and an absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">A limited number of patients at or above 65 years of age have been treated with clobetasol propionate cream (n = 231) in US and non-US clinical trials. While the number of patients is too small to permit separate analysis of efficacy and safety, the adverse reactions reported in this population were similar to those reported by younger patients. Based on available data, no adjustment of dosage of clobetasol propionate cream in geriatric patients is warranted.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">In controlled clinical trials, the most frequent adverse reactions reported for clobetasol propionate cream were burning and stinging sensation in 1% of treated patients. Less frequent adverse reactions were itching, skin atrophy, and cracking and fissuring of the skin.</p><p>Cushing syndrome has been reported in infants and adults as a result of prolonged use of topical clobetasol propionate formulations.</p><p>The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids, and they may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids. These reactions are listed in an approximately decreasing order of occurrence: dryness, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, irritation, striae, and miliaria.</p><p>To report <span class="Bold">SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>, contact Teligent Pharma, Inc. at 1-856-697-1441 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Topically applied clobetasol propionate cream can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects (see PRECAUTIONS ).</p><h2>Clobetex Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Apply a thin layer of clobetasol propionate cream to the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently and completely (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).</p><p>Clobetasol propionate cream is a super-high potency topical corticosteroid; therefore, <span class="Bold">treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks and amounts greater than 50 g/week should not be used.</span></p><p>As with other highly active corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control has been achieved.

</ul><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Risk Summary</p><p>The limited available data with desloratadine in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rats was not teratogenic at the summed area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 320 times that at the recommended human daily oral dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day. Desloratadine given during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits was not teratogenic at the AUC-based exposures of desloratadine approximately 230 times that at the RHD. Desloratadine given to pregnant rats during organogenesis through lactation resulted in reduced body weight and slow righting reflex of F1 pups at the summed AUC-based exposures of desloratadine and its metabolite approximately 70 times or greater than that at the RHD [see Data].</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p>Data</p><p>Animal Data:</p><p>Desloratadine was given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rats at doses of 6, 24 and 48 mg/kg/day (approximately 50, 200 and 320 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). No fetal malformations were present. Reduced fetal weights and skeletal variations noted at doses of 24 and 48 mg/kg/day were likely secondary to the maternal toxicities of reduced body weight gain and food consumption observed at the same doses. Desloratadine was also given orally during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 30, 70 and 230 times the AUC- based exposure of desloratadine at the RHD). No adverse effects to the fetus were noted. Reduced maternal body weight gain was noted in rabbits at 60 mg/kg/day. In a peri- and post-natal development study, desloratadine was given to rats orally during the peri- natal (Gestation Day 6) through lactation periods (Postpartum Day 21) at doses of 3, 9 and 18 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in F1 pups at doses of 9 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 70 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on F1 pup development at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption were noted at 18 mg/kg/day for F0 dams. F1 offspring were subsequently mated and there was no developmental toxicity for F2 pups observed.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">Risk Summary</p><p>Desloratadine passes into breast milk. There are not sufficient data on the effects of desloratadine on the breastfed infant or the effects of desloratadine on milk production. The decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue desloratadine, taking into account the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding, the nursing mother's clinical need, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from desloratadine or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Infertility</p><p>There are no data available on human infertility associated with desloratadine.</p><p>There were no clinically relevant effects of desloratadine on female fertility in rats. A male specific decrease in fertility occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg or greater in rats (approximately 65 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Male fertility was unaffected at a desloratadine dose of 3 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). [See NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1).]</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of desloratadine oral solution in the pediatric population is based on cross-study comparison of the plasma concentration of desloratadine in adults and pediatric subjects. The safety of desloratadine oral solution has been established in 246 pediatric subjects aged 6 months to 11 years in three placebo-controlled clinical studies. Since the course of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and the effects of desloratadine are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations, it allows extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The effectiveness of desloratadine oral solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of desloratadine tablets in adults. The safety and effectiveness of desloratadine tablets or desloratadine oral solution have not been demonstrated in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age. [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.5) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.5) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>There is no information to indicate that abuse or dependency occurs with desloratadine tablets.</h3><p class="First">​There is no information to indicate that abuse or dependency occurs with desloratadine tablets.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of overdose, consider standard measures to remove any unabsorbed drug. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are not eliminated by hemodialysis.</p><p>Information regarding acute overdosage is limited to experience from post-marketing adverse event reports and from clinical trials conducted during the development of the desloratadine product. In a dose-ranging trial, at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg/day somnolence was reported.</p><p>In another study, no clinically relevant adverse events were reported in normal male and female volunteers who were given single daily doses of desloratadine 45 mg for 10 days [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2)].</p><h2>Clobetex Description</h2><p class="First">Desloratadine tablets USP, 5 mg are light blue, circular, biconvex, film-coated tablets debossed "LU" on one side and "S71" on other side, containing 5 mg desloratadine, an antihistamine, to be administered orally.

Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2 to 3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H1-receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro. Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H1-receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Wheal and Flare</p><p>Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5 mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5 mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown.</p><p>Effects on QTc</p><p>Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In desloratadine-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc (Bazett) there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. Using QTc (Fridericia) there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in desloratadine-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Absorption</p><p>Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5 mg tablet once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (Tmax) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and AUC of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng∙hr/mL were observed, respectively. Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (Cmax and AUC) of desloratadine.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine oral solution was evaluated in a three-way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers. A single dose of 10 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg desloratadine tablet. Food had no effect on the bioavailability (AUC and Cmax) of desloratadine oral solution.</p><p>Distribution</p><p>Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82% to 87% and 85% to 89% bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function.</p><p class="First">Metabolism Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n=988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n=1,462) and Hispanics (2%, n=1,063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with desloratadine oral solution for 15 to 35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out.</p><p class="First">Elimination</p><p>The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours. Cmax and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar Tmax and half-life values compared to desloratadine.</p><p>Special Populations</p><p>Geriatric Subjects:</p><p>In older subjects (≥65 years old; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of desloratadine tablets, the mean Cmax and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (&lt;65 years old). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups. The mean plasma elimination half-life of desloratadine was 33.7 hr in subjects ≥65 years old. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects.</p><p class="First">Pediatric Subjects:</p><p>In subjects 6 to 11 years old, a single dose of 5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 2.5 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. In subjects 2 to 5 years old, a single dose of 2.5 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg of desloratadine, resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg desloratadine tablet. However, the Cmax and AUC of the metabolite (3-hydroxydesloratadine) were 1.27 and 1.61 times higher for the 5 mg dose of oral solution administered in adults compared to the Cmax and AUC obtained in children 2 to 11 years of age receiving 1.25 to 2.5 mg of desloratadine oral solution.</p><p>A single dose of either 2.5 mL or 1.25 mL of desloratadine oral solution containing 1.25 mg or 0.625 mg, respectively, of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age. The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1.25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg dose of desloratadine oral solution.</p><p>Renally Impaired:</p><p>Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51 to 69 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34 to 43 mL/min/1.73 m2), and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment or hemodialysis dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, median Cmax and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis dependent, Cmax and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.5)].</p><p class="First">Hepatically Impaired:</p><p>Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36%, and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination half-life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean Cmax and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.5)].</p><p>Gender:</p><p>Female subjects treated for 14 days with desloratadine tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine Cmax and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine Cmax and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males. However, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Race:</span></span></p><p>Following 14 days of treatment with desloratadine tablets, the C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10% reduction in C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Drug Interactions:</span></span></p><p>In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pretreatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady-state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. Although increased plasma concentrations (C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC <span class="Sub">0 to 24 hrs</span>) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 2), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity Studies</p><p>The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 45 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known. In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively (approximately 30 and 70 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD, respectively), did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors.</p><p class="First">Genotoxicity Studies</p><p>In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay (Salmonella/E. coli mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay).</p><p>Impairment of Fertility</p><p>In a female fertility study, desloratadine was given to female rats orally 14 days prior to and throughout mating until Gestation Day 7 at doses of 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day. An increase in preimplantation loss and a decrease in number of implantations and fetuses noted at 24 mg/kg (approximately 200 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) was likely due to maternal toxicities including reduced body weight gain and food consumption. In a male fertility study in rats, desloratadine was given orally to male rats for 70 days prior to mating and throughout the mating period (total dosing period 106 to 108 days) at doses of 3, 12 and 40 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight gain, food consumption, and absolute organ weights of testes, epididymis, and cauda epididymis were noted at 40 mg/kg/day. A male-specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic changes in testes and epididymis, occurred at a dose of 12 mg/kg or greater (approximately 65 times or greater than the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). Desloratadine had no effect on male fertility in rats at 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis</h3><p class="First">The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets were evaluated in over 2300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 1838 patients received 2.5 to 20 mg/day of desloratadine in 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets, 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose-ranging trial, desloratadine 2.5 to 20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5.0 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%).</p><p>In two 4-week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, desloratadine tablets, 5 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This supports the safety of administering desloratadine tablets to adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma.</p><p>Desloratadine tablets, 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the Total Symptom Score (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. See Table 3.</p><p>There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of desloratadine tablets, 5 mg across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race.</p><h3>Perennial Allergic Rhinitis</h3><p class="First">The clinical efficacy and safety of desloratadine tablets, 5 mg were evaluated in over 1300 patients 12 to 80 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis. A total of 685 patients received 5 mg/day of desloratadine tablets in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States and internationally. In one of these studies desloratadine tablets, 5 mg once daily was shown to significantly reduce the Total Symptom Score in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (Table 4).</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Desloratadine tablets USP, 5 mg are light blue, circular, biconvex, film-coated tablets, debossed "LU" on one side and "S71" on other side.
