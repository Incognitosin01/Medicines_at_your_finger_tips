There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or treatment.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Viokace may increase your chance of having a rare bowel disorder called fibrosing colonopathy. This condition is serious and may require surgery.

Adults with swelling of the pancreas that lasts a long time (chronic pancreatitis), or who have had some or all of their pancreas removed (pancreatectomy) may not digest food normally because they do not make enough enzymes or because their enzymes are not released into the bowel (intestine).</p><p>Viokace contains a mixture of digestive enzymes (including lipases, proteases, and amylases) from pig pancreas.</p><p>It is not known if Viokace is safe and effective in children. Use of Viokace in children may result in poor nutrition and slowing of growth.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Before taking Viokace, tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you:</p><ul>
<li>are allergic to pork (pig) products</li>
<li>have a history of blockage of your intestines, or scarring or thickening of your bowel wall (fibrosing colonopathy)</li>
<li>have gout, kidney disease, or a condition called high blood uric acid (hyperuricemia)</li>
