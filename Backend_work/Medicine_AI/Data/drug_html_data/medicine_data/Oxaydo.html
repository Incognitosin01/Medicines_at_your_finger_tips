Babies born dependent on opioids may need medical treatment for several weeks.</p><p><b>Ask a doctor before using opioid medicine if you are breastfeeding.</b> Tell your doctor if you notice severe drowsiness or slow breathing in the nursing baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use  Oxaydo?</h2><p>Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Never use Oxaydo in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if you feel an increased urge to take more of  Oxaydo.</p><p><b>Never share opioid medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away opioid medicine is against the law.</p><p>Stop taking all other around-the-clock opioid pain medicines when you start taking extended-release Oxaydo.</p><p>Take Oxaydo with food.</p><p><b>Swallow the capsule or tablet whole</b> to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal overdose. Do not crush, chew, break, open, or dissolve.</p><p>If you cannot swallow a capsule whole, open it and sprinkle the medicine into a spoonful of pudding or applesauce. Swallow the mixture right away without chewing. Do not save it for later use.</p><p>Never crush or break an Oxaydo pill to inhale the powder or mix it into a liquid to inject the drug into your vein. This can cause in death.</p><p>Measure liquid medicine carefully. Use the dosing syringe provided, or use a medicine dose-measuring device (not a kitchen spoon).</p><p>You should not stop using Oxaydo suddenly. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.</p><p>Store at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and light. Keep track of your medicine. Oxaydo is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Do not keep leftover opioid medication. <b>Just one dose can cause death in someone using this medicine accidentally or improperly.</b> Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, flush the unused medicine down the toilet.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since  Oxaydo is used for pain, you are not likely to miss a dose. Skip any missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>An opioid overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Overdose symptoms may include severe drowsiness, pinpoint pupils, slow breathing, or no breathing.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend you get naloxone (a medicine to reverse an opioid overdose) and keep it with you at all times. A person caring for you can give the naloxone if you stop breathing or don't wake up. Your caregiver must still get emergency medical help and may need to perform CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on you while waiting for help to arrive.</p><p>Anyone can buy naloxone from a pharmacy or local health department. Make sure any person caring for you knows where you keep naloxone and how to use it.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using  Oxaydo?</h2><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><p>Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how Oxaydo will affect you. Dizziness or severe drowsiness can cause falls or other accidents.</p><p>Avoid medication errors. Always check the brand and strength of oxycodone you get from the pharmacy.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Oxaydo side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Opioid medicine can slow or stop your breathing, and death may occur.
