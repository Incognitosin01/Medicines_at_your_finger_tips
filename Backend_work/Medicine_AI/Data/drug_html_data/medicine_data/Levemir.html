Insulin works by lowering levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood.</p><p>Levemir is a long-acting insulin that starts to work several hours after injection and keeps working evenly for up to 24 hours.</p><p>Levemir is used to improve blood sugar control in people with diabetes mellitus. This medicine is for use in adults and children at least 2 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Levemir if you are allergic to insulin detemir, or if you are in a state of diabetic ketoacidosis (call your doctor for treatment with a short-acting insulin).</p><p><b>Never share a Levemir injection pen or syringe with another person, even if the needle has been changed.</b></p><p>Many other drugs can potentially interfere with the effects of Levemir. It is extremely important that you tell your doctor about all the prescription and over-the-counter medications you use. This includes prescription, over-the-counter, vitamin, and herbal products. Do not start a new medication without telling your doctor.</p><p>Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can occur if you skip a meal, exercise too long, drink alcohol, or are under stress. An insulin overdose can cause life-threatening hypoglycemia. Know the signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and how to recognize them: headache, hunger, weakness, sweating, tremors, irritability, or trouble concentrating. Be sure your family and close friends know how to help you in an emergency.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Levemir if you are allergic to iinsulin detemir. Do not use during an episode of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or diabetic ketoacidosis (call your doctor for treatment).</p><p>To make sure Levemir is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>low levels of potassium in your blood (hypokalemia); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>liver or kidney disease.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>low levels of potassium in your blood (hypokalemia); or</p><p>liver or kidney disease.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you also take pioglitazone or rosiglitazone (sometimes contained in combinations with glimepiride or metformin). Taking certain oral diabetes medicines while you are using Levemir may increase your risk of serious heart problems.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about using Levemir<b>if you are pregnant or you become pregnant.</b> Controlling diabetes is very important during pregnancy, and having high blood sugar may cause complications in both the mother and the baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use Levemir?</h2><p>Use Levemir exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets.</p><p>Levemir is injected under the skin. A healthcare provider may teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand all instructions.</p><p>Prepare an injection only when you are ready to give it. Do not use if the medicine looks cloudy, has changed colors, or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p>Your healthcare provider will show you where on your body to inject Levemir. Use a different place each time you give an injection.
