Assess patient’s risk before prescribing and monitor closely for these behaviors and conditions.Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or when used in patients at higher risk.Accidental ingestion of hydrocodone bitartrate/guaifenesin, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of hydrocodoneEnsure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering hydrocodone bitartrate/guaifenesin. Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death.Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers) can result in a fatal overdose of hydrocodone. Avoid the use of hydrocodone bitartrate/guaifenesin in patients taking CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Avoid use of hydrocodone bitartrate/guaifenesin in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.Instruct patients not to consume alcohol or any products containing alcohol while taking hydrocodone bitartrate/guaifenesin because co-ingestion can result in fatal plasma hydrocodone levels.Hydrocodone bitartrate/guaifenesin is not recommended for use in pregnant women. Prolonged use of hydrocodone bitartrate/guaifenesin during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. If hydrocodone bitartrate/guaifenesin is used for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available .</p><p>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse:Hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Reserve hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets for use in adult patients for whom the benefits of cough suppression are expected to outweigh the risks, and in whom an adequate assessment of the etiology of the cough has been made. Assess each patient’s risk prior to prescribing hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets, prescribe hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets for the shortest duration that is consistent with individual patient treatment goals, monitor all patients regularly for the development of addition or abuse, and refill only after reevaluation of the need for continued treatment.Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression:Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets therapy or when used in patients at higher risk.Accidental Ingestion:Accidental ingestion of even one dose of hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of hydrocodone.Risk of Medication ErrorsEnsure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets. Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death.Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction:The concomitant use of hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in hydrocodone plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in hydrocodone plasma concentration. Avoid the use of hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets in patients taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer.Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants:Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Avoid the use of hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.Interaction with Alcohol:Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products that contain alcohol while taking hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets. The co-ingestion of alcohol with hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of hydrocodone.Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome:Hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women. Prolonged use of hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin tablets is used for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

It acts directly on the cough center in the brain to relieve cough. Guaifenesin is used to help clear mucus or phlegm from the chest when you have congestion from a cold or flu. It works by thinning the mucus or phlegm in the lungs.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Monte-G HC</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>The use of hydrocodone in children younger than 6 years of age has caused serious breathing problems, sometimes causing death. Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of guaifenesin and hydrocodone combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of guaifenesin and hydrocodone combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to develop age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving this medicine.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
