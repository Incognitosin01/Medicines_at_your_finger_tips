</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Ketoconazole Foam</h2><p class="First">Ketoconazole Foam, 2% is indicated for the topical treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in immunocompetent patients 12 years of age and older.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span></p><p>Safety and efficacy of Ketoconazole Foam, 2% for treatment of fungal infections have not been established.</p><h2>Ketoconazole Foam Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Ketoconazole Foam, 2% should be applied to the affected area(s) twice daily for four weeks.</p><p>Hold the container upright, and dispense Ketoconazole Foam, 2% into the cap of the can or other cool surface in an amount sufficient to cover the affected area(s). Dispensing directly onto hands is not recommended, as the foam will begin to melt immediately upon contact with warm skin. Pick up small amounts of Ketoconazole Foam, 2% with the fingertips, and gently massage into the affected area(s) until the foam disappears. For hair-bearing areas, part the hair, so that Ketoconazole Foam, 2% may be applied directly to the skin (rather than on the hair).</p><p>Avoid contact with the eyes and other mucous membranes. Ketoconazole Foam, 2% is not for ophthalmic, oral or intravaginal use.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Ketoconazole Foam, 2% contains 20 mg of ketoconazole, USP per gram, supplied in 50 g and 100 g containers.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Contact Sensitization</h3><p class="First">Ketoconazole Foam, 2% may result in contact sensitization, including photoallergenicity. <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>]</p><h3>Flammable Contents</h3><p class="First">The contents of Ketoconazole Foam, 2% include alcohol and propane/butane, which are flammable. Avoid fire, flame and/or smoking during and immediately following application. Do not puncture and/or incinerate the containers. Do not expose containers to heat and/or store at temperatures above 120°F (49°C).</p><h3>Systemic Effects</h3><p class="First">Hepatitis has been seen with orally administered ketoconazole (1:10,000 reported incidence). Lowered testosterone and ACTH–induced corticosteroid serum levels have been seen with high doses of orally administered ketoconazole. These effects have not been seen with topical ketoconazole.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse reactions that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.</p><p>The safety data presented in Table 1 reflect exposure to Ketoconazole Foam, 2% in 672 subjects, 12 years and older with seborrheic dermatitis. Subjects applied Ketoconazole Foam, 2% or vehicle foam twice daily for 4 weeks to affected areas on the face, scalp, and/or chest. Adverse reactions occurring in &gt; 1% of subjects are presented in Table 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported by &gt;1% Subjects in Clinical Trials</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ketoconazole Foam, 2%</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N=672</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vehicle Foam</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N=497</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Subjects with an Adverse Reaction</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">188 (28%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">122 (25%)</span></p><p class="First">Application site burning</p><p class="First">67 (10%)</p><p class="First">49 (10%)</p><p class="First">Application site reaction</p><p class="First">41 (6%)</p><p class="First">24 (5%)</p><p>Application site reactions that were reported in &lt;1% of subjects were dryness, erythema, irritation, paresthesia, pruritus, rash and warmth.</p><h3>Dermal Safety Studies</h3><p class="First">In a photoallergenicity study, 9 of 53 subjects (17%) had reactions during the challenge period at both the irradiated and non-irradiated sites treated with Ketoconazole Foam, 2%. Ketoconazole Foam, 2% may cause contact sensitization.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse events have been identified during postmarketing use of Ketoconazole Foam, 2%:</p><p>Gastrointestinal disorders: Cheilitis</p><p>General disorders and administration site conditions: Application site pain and application site burn</p><p>Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Skin burning sensation and erythema</p><p>Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>There are no available data on Ketoconazole Foam, 2% use in pregnant women to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No reproductive studies in animals have been performed with Ketoconazole Foam, 2%. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant mice, rats and rabbits both embryotoxic and developmental effects (structural abnormalities) were observed following oral dosing of ketoconazole during organogenesis. Assuming equivalent systemic absorption of topical and oral ketoconazole doses and a Ketoconazole Foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 160 mg ketoconazole), embryotoxic effects were observed at 0.8 to 2.4 times the MRHD and developmental effects were observed at 4.8 times the MRHD <span class="Italics">[see Data].</span></p><p>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>The animal multiples of human exposure calculations are based on body surface area (BSA) comparisons of oral doses administered to animals and a Ketoconazole Foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 2.67 mg ketoconazole/kg/day for a 60 kg individual or 98.8 mg ketoconazole/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day).</p><p>Embryofetal development studies have been conducted in mice, rats and rabbits with orally administered ketoconazole. When orally administered to mice on gestational days 6 through 18 (covering the period of organogenesis), ketoconazole was embryotoxic (25 mg/kg and higher; 0.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) with a high incidence of resorptions, increased number of stillbirths and delayed parturition. Delays in maturation were also observed. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity or malformations at up to 50 mg/kg (1.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). No treatment related developmental effects were observed at 10 mg/kg (0.3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons).</p><p>In the presence of maternal toxicity in rats, orally administered ketoconazole was both embryotoxic (40 mg/kg and higher; 2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including increased resorbed fetuses and stillbirths, and teratogenic (80 mg/kg and higher; 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including syndactylia, oligodactylia, waved ribs and cleft palate. Additionally, 100 mg/kg (6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) ketoconazole orally administered on a single day during gestation (gestational days 9 through 12) was embryotoxic (increased resorptions). This same oral dose given on gestation day 12, 13, 14 or 15 induced external malformations including cleft palate, micromelia and digital anomalies (brachydactyly, ectrodactyly, syndactyly).</p><p>In pregnant rabbits orally administered ketoconazole, evidence of embryotoxicity (increased resorptions) was observed at 10 mg/kg (1.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher and an increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities was observed at 40 mg/kg (4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>There is no information available on the presence of ketoconazole in human milk, or the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production after topical application of Ketoconazole Foam, 2% to women who are breastfeeding. In animal studies ketoconazole was found in milk following oral administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Ketoconazole Foam, 2% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Ketoconazole Foam, 2% or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></span></p><p>In animal fertility studies in rats and dogs, administration of oral doses of ketoconazole between 3-day and 3-month periods resulted in infertility that was reversible <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Ketoconazole Foam, 2% in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established.</p><p>Of the 672 subjects treated with Ketoconazole Foam, 2% in the clinical trials, 44 (7%) were from 12 to 17 years of age. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 672 subjects treated with Ketoconazole Foam, 2% in the clinical trials, 107 (16%) were 65 years and over.</p><p>Clinical trials of Ketoconazole Foam, 2% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects.</p><h2>Ketoconazole Foam Description</h2><p class="First">Ketoconazole Foam, 2% contains 2% ketoconazole USP, an antifungal agent, in a thermolabile hydroethanolic foam for topical application.</p><p>The chemical name for ketoconazole is piperazine, 1-acetyl-4-[4-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) -2-(1<span class="Italics">H</span>-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-1, 3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]-, <span class="Italics">cis</span>- with the molecular formula C<span class="Sub">26</span>H<span class="Sub">28</span>CI<span class="Sub">2</span>N<span class="Sub">4</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span> and a molecular weight of 531.43.</p><p>The following is the chemical structure:</p><p>Ketoconazole Foam, 2% contains 20 mg ketoconazole per gram in a thermolabile hydroethanolic foam vehicle consisting of cetyl alcohol, citric acid, ethanol (denatured with <span class="Italics">tert</span>-butyl alcohol and brucine sulfate) 58%, polysorbate 60, potassium citrate, propylene glycol, purified water, and stearyl alcohol pressurized with a hydrocarbon (propane/butane) propellant.</p><h2>Ketoconazole Foam - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of ketoconazole in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis is not known.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacodynamics of Ketoconazole Foam, 2% has not been established.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">In a bioavailability study, 12 subjects with moderate to severe seborrheic dermatitis applied 3 g of Ketoconazole Foam, 2% twice daily for 4 weeks. Circulating plasma levels of ketoconazole were &lt; 6 ng/mL for a majority of subjects (75%), with a maximum level of 11 ng/mL observed in one subject.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent which inhibits the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> synthesis of ergosterol, a key sterol in the cell membrane of <span class="Italics">Malassezia furfur</span>. The clinical significance of antifungal activity in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis is not known.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic or photo-carcinogenic potential of Ketoconazole Foam, 2%.</p><p>In oral carcinogenicity studies in mice (18-months) and rats (24-months) at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day ketoconazole was not carcinogenic. The high dose in these studies was approximately 2.4 to 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons. In a bacterial reverse mutation assay, ketoconazole did not express any mutagenic potential. In three <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> assays (sister chromatid exchange in humans, dominant lethal and micronucleus tests in mice), ketoconazole did not exhibit any genotoxic potential.</p><p>In animal fertility studies, oral ketoconazole impaired both male and female fertility in rats in a dose and duration dependent manner. In females, oral doses up to 40 mg/kg (2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) had no effect on fertility, while doses of 75 mg/kg (4.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher decreased the pregnancy rate and number of implantation sites. In male rats, oral dosing at 200 mg/kg/day (12 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days decreased fertility and 400 mg/kg/day (24 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days resulted in a complete loss of fertility. When administered for longer durations (up to 3 months), decreased fertility in male rats was observed at doses as low as 24 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In male beagle dogs, an oral dose of 25 mg/kg/day ketoconazole for up to 4 weeks (5.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) resulted in decreased sperm motility, decreased sperm count, increased abnormal sperm and atrophy of the testes. These effects were reversed subsequent to withdrawal of treatment.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of Ketoconazole Foam, 2% were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial in subjects 12 years and older with mild to severe seborrheic dermatitis. In the trial, 427 subjects received Ketoconazole Foam, 2% and 420 subjects received vehicle foam. Subjects applied Ketoconazole Foam, 2% or vehicle foam twice daily for 4 weeks to affected areas on the face, scalp, and/or chest. The overall disease severity in terms of erythema, scaling, and induration was assessed at Baseline and week 4 on a 5-point Investigator’s Static Global Assessment (ISGA) scale.</p><p>Treatment success was defined as achieving a Week 4 (end of treatment) ISGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (majority of lesions have individual scores for scaling, erythema, and induration that averages 1 [minimal or faint]) and at least two grades of improvement from baseline. The results are presented in Table 2. The database was not large enough to assess whether there were differences in effects in age, gender, or race subgroups.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Efficacy Results</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Number of Subjects</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ketoconazole Foam, 2%</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 427</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vehicle Foam</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 420</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n (%)</span></p><p class="First">Subjects Achieving Treatment Success</p><p class="First">239 (56%)</p><p class="First">176 (42%)</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Ketoconazole Foam, 2% contains 20 mg of ketoconazole, USP per gram.
