</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Mycophenolate Suspension</h2><p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection, in recipients of allogeneic kidney <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>, heart <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span> or liver transplants <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>, in combination with other immunosuppressants.</p><h2>Mycophenolate Suspension Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mycophenolate mofetil should not be used without the supervision of a physician with experience in immunosuppressive therapy.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Mycophenolate mofetil for Oral Suspension</span></p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil oral dosage forms (oral suspension) <span class="Bold">should not be used interchangeably with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets without supervision of a physician with experience in immunosuppressive therapy</span> because the rates of absorption following the administration of mycophenolate mofetil oral dosage forms and mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are not equivalent.</p><p>Patients should avoid inhalation or contact of the skin or mucous membranes with the powder contained in mycophenolate mofetil for oral suspension. If such contact occurs, they must wash the area of contact thoroughly with soap and water. In case of ocular contact, rinse eyes with plain water.</p><p>The initial oral dose of mycophenolate mofetil should be given as soon as possible following kidney, heart or liver transplant. It is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil be administered on an empty stomach. In stable transplant patients, however, mycophenolate mofetil may be administered with food if necessary <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Once reconstituted, Mycophenolate mofetil for Oral Suspension must not be mixed with any liquids prior to dose administration. If needed, Mycophenolate mofetil for Oral Suspension can be administered via a nasogastric tube with a minimum size of 8 French (minimum 1.7 mm interior diameter).</p><p>Patients should be instructed to take a missed dose as soon as they remember, except if it is closer than 2 hours to the next scheduled dose; in this case, they should continue to take mycophenolate mofetil at the usual times.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous</span></p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous is recommended for patients unable to take oral mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous should be administered within 24 hours following transplant. Mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous can be administered for up to 14 days; however, patients should be switched to oral mycophenolate mofetil as soon as they can tolerate oral medication.</p><h3>Dosing for Kidney Transplant Patients: Adults and Pediatrics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The recommended dose for adult kidney transplant patients is 1 g orally or intravenously infused over no less than 2 hours, twice daily (daily dose of 2 g).</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatrics (3 months and older)</span></p><p>Pediatric dosing is based on body surface area (BSA). The recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil for oral suspension for pediatric kidney transplant patients 3 months and older is 600 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, administered twice daily (maximum daily dose of 2g or 10 mL of the oral suspension). Pediatric patients with BSA ≥ 1.25 m<span class="Sup">2</span> may be dosed with capsules or tablets as follows:</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1.

In <span class="Bold">kidney transplant patients with severe chronic impairment of the graft</span> (GFR &lt;25 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>), do not administer doses of mycophenolate mofetil greater than 1 g twice a day. These patients should be carefully monitored <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Neutropenia</span></p><p>If neutropenia develops (ANC &lt;1.3 x 10<span class="Sup">3</span>/mcL), dosing with mycophenolate mofetil should be interrupted or reduced, appropriate diagnostic tests performed, and the patient managed appropriately <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Preparation Instructions of Oral Suspension for Pharmacists</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General Preparation Instructions Before Handling the Formulations</span></p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has demonstrated teratogenic effects in humans. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures.<span class="Sup">1</span><span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)]</span></p><p>Care should be taken to avoid inhalation or direct contact with skin or mucous membranes of the dry powder or the constituted suspension because MMF has demonstrated teratogenic effects in humans. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended during reconstitution and when wiping the outer surface of the bottle/cap and the table surface after reconstitution. If such contact occurs, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water; rinse eyes with water.</p><p>Alert patients that they and others should also avoid inhalation or contact of the skin or mucous membranes with the oral suspension. Advise them to wash the area thoroughly with soap and water if such contact occurs; if ocular contact occurs, rinse eyes with plain water.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mycophenolate mofetil for Oral Suspension</span></p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil for Oral Suspension must be reconstituted by the pharmacist prior to dispensing to the patient. Mycophenolate mofetil for Oral Suspension should not be mixed with any other medication. After reconstitution, the oral suspension contains 200 mg/mL MMF.</p><p>Before proceeding with the reconstitution steps read the general preparation instructions above <span class="Italics">[see General Preparation Instructions Before Handling the Formulations]</span>. The following are the steps for reconstitution:</p><p class="First">Tap the closed bottle several times to loosen the powder.</p><p class="First">Measure 91 mL of water in a graduated cylinder.</p><p class="First">Add approximately half the total amount of water for reconstitution to the bottle and shake the closed bottle well for about 1 minute.</p><p class="First">Add the remainder of water and shake the closed bottle well for about 1 minute.</p><p class="First">Remove the child-resistant cap and push bottle adapter into neck of bottle.</p><p class="First">Close bottle with child-resistant cap tightly. This will assure the proper seating of the bottle adapter in the bottle and child-resistant status of the cap.</p><p class="First">Write the date of expiration of the constituted suspension on the bottle label. (The shelf-life of the constituted suspension is 60 days.)</p><p class="First">Dispense with the “Instruction for Use” and oral dispensers. Alert patients to read the important handling information described in the instructions for use.</p><p>Store reconstituted suspension at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Storage in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) is acceptable. Do not freeze. Discard any unused portion 60 days after constitution.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil is available in the following dosage form and strength:</p><p class="First">For oral suspension</p><p class="First">35 g mycophenolate mofetil white to off-white powder, 200 mg/mL upon reconstitution.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Allergic reactions to mycophenolate mofetil have been observed; therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mycophenolic acid (MPA) or any component of the drug product.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Embryofetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Use of MMF during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney and nervous system. Females of reproductive potential must be made aware of these risks and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. Avoid use of MMF during pregnancy if safer treatment options are available <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Lymphoma and Other Malignancies</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (<span class="Italics">6.1)]</span>.</span>The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. For patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.</p><p>Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of kidney, heart and liver transplant patients <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. The majority of PTLD cases appear to be related to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides PTLD were observed in clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Serious Infections</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, fungal, protozoal and new or reactivated viral infections, including opportunistic infections. The risk increases with the total immunosuppressive load. These infections may lead to serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and death <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), (6.2)]</span>.</p><p>Serious viral infections reported include:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>
<p class="First">Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections: CMV seronegative transplant patients who receive an organ from a CMV seropositive donor are at highest risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">Viral reactivation in patients infected with Hepatitis B and C</p>
</li>
</ul><p class="First">Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection</p><p class="First">JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and</p><p class="First">Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections: CMV seronegative transplant patients who receive an organ from a CMV seropositive donor are at highest risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease.</p><p class="First">Viral reactivation in patients infected with Hepatitis B and C</p><p>Consider reducing immunosuppression in patients who develop new infections or reactivate viral infections, weighing the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft.</p><p>PVAN, especially due to BK virus infection, is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN.</p><p>PML, which is sometimes fatal, commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies, and ataxia <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms.</p><p>The risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease is highest among transplant recipients seronegative for CMV at time of transplant who receive a graft from a CMV seropositive donor. Therapeutic approaches to limiting CMV disease exist and should be routinely provided. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for CMV disease.</p><p>Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Monitoring infected patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV or HCV infection is recommended.</p><h3>Blood Dyscrasias: Neutropenia and Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA)</h3><p class="First">Severe neutropenia [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;0.5 x 10<span class="Sup">3</span>/mcL] developed in transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil should be monitored for neutropenia. Neutropenia has been observed most frequently in the period from 31 to 180 days post-transplant in patients treated for prevention of kidney, heart and liver rejection. The development of neutropenia may be related to mycophenolate mofetil itself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or a combination of these causes. If neutropenia develops (ANC &lt;1.3 x 10<span class="Sup">3</span>/mcL), dosing with mycophenolate mofetil should be interrupted or the dose reduced, appropriate diagnostic tests performed, and the patient managed appropriately <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>.  </p><p>Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, unexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow depression.</p><p>Consider monitoring with complete blood counts weekly for the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months, and monthly for the remainder of the first year.</p><p>Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. In some cases, PRCA was found to be reversible with dose reduction or cessation of mycophenolate mofetil therapy. In transplant patients, however, reduced immunosuppression may place the graft at risk.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Complications</h3><p class="First">Gastrointestinal bleeding requiring hospitalization, ulceration and perforations were observed in clinical trials. Physicians should be aware of these serious adverse effects particularly when administering mycophenolate mofetil to patients with a gastrointestinal disease.</p><h3>Patients with Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyl-Transferase Deficiency (HGPRT)</h3><p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor; therefore it should be avoided in patients with hereditary deficiencies of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndromes because it may cause an exacerbation of disease symptoms characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of uric acid leading to symptoms associated with gout such as acute arthritis, tophi, nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis and renal disease including  renal failure.</p><h3>Immunizations</h3><p class="First">During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (e.g., intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines) and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective. Advise patients to discuss with the physician before seeking any immunizations.</p><h3>Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria</h3><p class="First">Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Mycophenolate mofetil for Oral Suspension contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine (0.56 mg phenylalanine/mL suspension). Before prescribing Mycophenolate mofetil for Oral Suspension to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including mycophenolate mofetil.</p><h3>Blood Donation</h3><p class="First">Patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil because their blood or blood products might be administered to a female of reproductive potential or a pregnant woman.</p><h3>Semen Donation</h3><p class="First">Based on animal data, men should not donate semen during therapy and for 90 days following discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil <span class="Italics">[see Use In Specific Populations (8.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Effect of Concomitant Medications on Mycophenolic Acid Concentrations</h3><p class="First">A variety of drugs have potential to alter systemic MPA exposure when co-administered with mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, determination of MPA concentrations in plasma before and after making any changes to immunosuppressive therapy, or when adding or discontinuing concomitant medications, may be appropriate to ensure MPA concentrations remain stable.</p><h3>Potential Impairment of Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery</h3><p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil may impact the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should avoid driving or using machines if they experience somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor, or hypotension during treatment with mycophenolate mofetil <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:</p><ul class="Disc">

It is the 2­ morpholinoethyl ester of mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunosuppressive agent; inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor.</p><p>The chemical name for mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is 2-morpholinoethyl (E)-6-(1,3­dihydro-4-hydroxy-6-methoxy-7-methyl-3-oxo-5-isobenzofuranyl)-4-methyl-4-hexenoate. It has an empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">23</span>H<span class="Sub">31</span>NO<span class="Sub">7</span>, a molecular weight of 433.50, and the following structural formula:</p><p>MMF is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is slightly soluble in water (43 mcg/mL at pH 7.4); the solubility increases in acidic medium (4.27 mg/mL at pH 3.6). It is freely soluble in acetone, soluble in methanol, and sparingly soluble in ethanol. The apparent partition coefficient in 1-octanol/water (pH 7.4) buffer solution is 238. The pKa values for MMF are 5.6 for the morpholino group and 8.5 for the phenolic group.</p><p>Mycophenolate mofetil is available for oral administration as a powder for oral suspension which, when reconstituted, contains 200 mg/mL of MMF.</p><p>Inactive ingredients in Mycophenolate mofetil for Oral Suspension include aspartame, banana flavor (contains arabic gum, natural flavor, potato maltodextrin, medium chain triglycerides), citric acid anhydrous, colloidal silicon dioxide, isopropyl alcohol*, lecithin granular, methylparaben, sodium citrate dihydrate, sorbitol, and xanthan gum.</p><p>*evaporated during processing; negligible amount may be present.</p><p>Net contents after constitution: 175 mL, containing 35 grams mycophenolate mofetil.</p><p>Deliverable volume after constitution: 160-165 mL.</p><h2>Mycophenolate Suspension - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is absorbed following oral administration and hydrolyzed to mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active metabolite. MPA is a selective, uncompetitive, and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and therefore inhibits the <span class="Italics">de novo</span> pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA. Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on <span class="Italics">de novo</span> synthesis of purines, whereas other cell types can utilize salvage pathways, MPA has potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes. MPA inhibits proliferative responses of T- and B-lymphocytes to both mitogenic and allospecific stimulation. Addition of guanosine or deoxyguanosine reverses the cytostatic effects of MPA on lymphocytes. MPA also suppresses antibody formation by B-lymphocytes. MPA prevents the glycosylation of lymphocyte and monocyte glycoproteins that are involved in intercellular adhesion to endothelial cells and may inhibit recruitment of leukocytes into sites of inflammation and graft rejection. MMF did not inhibit early events in the activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, such as the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), but did block the coupling of these events to DNA synthesis and proliferation.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">There is a lack of information regarding the pharmacodynamic effects of MMF.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following oral and intravenous administration, MMF undergoes complete conversion to MPA, the active metabolite. In 12 healthy volunteers, the mean absolute bioavailability of oral MMF relative to intravenous MMF was 94%. Two 500 mg mycophenolate mofetil tablets have been shown to be bioequivalent to four 250 mg mycophenolate mofetil capsules. Five mL of the 200 mg/mL constituted mycophenolate mofetil for oral suspension have been shown to be bioequivalent to four 250 mg capsules.</p><p>The mean (±SD) pharmacokinetic parameters estimates for MPA following the administration of MMF given as single doses to healthy volunteers, and multiple doses to kidney, heart, and liver transplant patients, are shown in <span class="Bold">Table 8</span>. The area under the plasma-concentration time curve (AUC) for MPA appears to increase in a dose-proportional fashion in kidney transplant patients receiving multiple oral doses of MMF up to a daily dose of 3 g (1.5g twice daily) (see <span class="Bold">Table 8</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 8.

At clinically relevant concentrations, MPA is 97% bound to plasma albumin. The phenolic glucuronide metabolite of MPA (MPAG) is 82% bound to plasma albumin at MPAG concentration ranges that are normally seen in stable kidney transplant patients; however, at higher MPAG concentrations (observed in patients with kidney impairment or delayed kidney graft function), the binding of MPA may be reduced as a result of competition between MPAG and MPA for protein binding. Mean blood to plasma ratio of radioactivity concentrations was approximately 0.6 indicating that MPA and MPAG do not extensively distribute into the cellular fractions of blood.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies to evaluate the effect of other agents on the binding of MPA to human serum albumin (HSA) or plasma proteins showed that salicylate (at 25 mg/dL with human serum albumin) and MPAG (at ≥ 460 mcg/mL with plasma proteins) increased the free fraction of MPA. MPA at concentrations as high as 100 mcg/mL had little effect on the binding of warfarin, digoxin or propranolol, but decreased the binding of theophylline from 53% to 45% and phenytoin from 90% to 87%.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Mean (±SD) apparent half-life and plasma clearance of MPA are 17.9 (±6.5) hours and 193 (±48) mL/min following oral administration and 16.6 (±5.8) hours and 177 (±31) mL/min following intravenous administration, respectively.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>The parent drug, MMF, can be measured systemically during the intravenous infusion; however, approximately 5 minutes after the infusion is stopped or after oral administration, MMF concentrations are below the limit of quantitation (0.4 mcg/mL).</p><p>Metabolism to MPA occurs pre-systemically after oral dosing. MPA is metabolized principally by glucuronyl transferase to form MPAG, which is not pharmacologically active. <span class="Italics">In vivo</span>, MPAG is converted to MPA during enterohepatic recirculation. The following metabolites of the 2-hydroxyethyl-morpholino moiety are also recovered in the urine following oral administration of MMF to healthy subjects: N-(2-carboxymethyl)-morpholine, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine, and the N-oxide of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine.</p><p>Due to the enterohepatic recirculation of MPAG/MPA, secondary peaks in the plasma MPA concentration-time profile are usually observed 6 to 12 hours post-dose. Bile sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, reduce MPA AUC by interfering with this enterohepatic recirculation of the drug <span class="Italics">[see Overdose (10)</span> and <span class="Italics">Drug Interaction</span><span class="Italics">Studies</span> below].</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Negligible amount of drug is excreted as MPA (less than 1% of dose) in the urine.

Most (about 87%) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. At clinically encountered concentrations, MPA and MPAG are usually not removed by hemodialysis. However, at high MPAG plasma concentrations (&gt;100 mcg/mL), small amounts of MPAG are removed.</p><p>Increased plasma concentrations of MMF metabolites (MPA 50% increase and MPAG about a 3-fold to 6-fold increase) are observed in patients with renal insufficiency <span class="Italics">[see Specific Populations]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The mean (±SD) pharmacokinetic parameters for MPA following the administration of oral MMF given as single doses to non-transplant subjects with renal impairment are presented in <span class="Bold">Table 9</span>.</p><p>In a single-dose study, MMF was administered as a capsule or as an intravenous infusion over 40 minutes.

In kidney transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC(0-12h)) was approximately 30-50% greater when MMF was administered without cyclosporine compared with when MMF was coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance­ associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA.

In a 104-week oral carcinogenicity study in rats, MMF in daily doses up to 15 mg/kg was not tumorigenic. The highest dose was 0.07 times the recommended clinical dose in kidney transplant patients and 0.05 times the recommended clinical dose in heart transplant patients when corrected for BSA.

MMF was not genotoxic in the bacterial mutation assay, the yeast mitotic gene conversion assay or the Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay.</p><p>MMF had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. This dose represents 0.1 times the recommended clinical dose in renal transplant patients and 0.06 times the recommended clinical dose in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for BSA. In a female fertility and reproduction study conducted in rats, oral doses of 4.5 mg/kg/day caused malformations (principally of the head and eyes) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. This dose was 0.02 times the recommended clinical dose in renal transplant patients and 0.01 times the recommended clinical dose in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for BSA.

People who take mycophenolate mofetil have a higher risk of getting skin cancer (See <span class="Bold">“What is the most important information I should know about mycophenolate mofetil?”</span>). Wear protective clothing when you are in the sun and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor. This is especially important if your skin is very fair or if you have a family history of skin cancer.</li>
