Refer to the ribavirin prescribing information for a list of contraindications for ribavirin <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Risk of Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation in Patients Coinfected with HCV and HBV</h3><p class="First">Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct acting antivirals, and who were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Cases have been reported in patients who are HBsAg positive and also in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection (i.e., HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive). HBV reactivation has also been reported in patients receiving certain immunosuppressants or chemotherapeutic agents; the risk of HBV reactivation associated with treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals may be increased in these patients.</p><p>HBV reactivation is characterized as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level. In patients with resolved HBV infection, reappearance of HBsAg can occur. Reactivation of HBV replication may be accompanied by hepatitis, i.e., increases in aminotransferase levels and, in severe cases, increases in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur.</p><p>Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating HCV treatment with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. In patients with serologic evidence of HBV infection, monitor for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir and during post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone</h3><p class="First">Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient taking amiodarone who was coadministered a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (HARVONI<span class="Sup">®</span> [ledipasvir/sofosbuvir]). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.</p><p>Coadministration of amiodarone with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative viable treatment options and who will be coadministered sofosbuvir and velpatasvir:</p><ul>
<li>Counsel patients about the risk of symptomatic bradycardia.</li>
<li>Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment.</li>
</ul><p>Patients who are taking sofosbuvir and velpatasvir who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.</p><p>Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting sofosbuvir and velpatasvir should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.</p><p>Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion, or memory problems <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Concomitant Use of Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir with Inducers of P-gp and/or Moderate to Strong Inducers of CYP</h3><p class="First">Drugs that are inducers of P-gp and/or moderate to strong inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort, carbamazepine) may significantly decrease plasma concentrations of sofosbuvir and/or velpatasvir, leading to potentially reduced therapeutic effect of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. The use of these agents with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Risks Associated with Ribavirin and Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir Combination Treatment</h3><p class="First">If sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is administered with ribavirin, the warnings and precautions for ribavirin apply to this combination regimen. Refer to the ribavirin prescribing information for a full list of the warnings and precautions for ribavirin <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in labeling:</p><ul>

In vitro, slow metabolic turnover of velpatasvir by CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 was observed.</p><p>Drugs that are inducers of P-gp and/or moderate to strong inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort, carbamazepine) may decrease plasma concentrations of sofosbuvir and/or velpatasvir, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. The use of these agents with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir may be coadministered with P-gp, BCRP, and CYP inhibitors.</p><h3>Potential for Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir to Affect Other Drugs</h3><p class="First">Velpatasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporters P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP2B1. Coadministration of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with drugs that are substrates of these transporters may increase the exposure of such drugs.</p><h3>Established and Potentially Significant Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Clearance of HCV infection with direct acting antivirals may lead to changes in hepatic function, which may impact the safe and effective use of concomitant medications. For example, altered blood glucose control resulting in serious symptomatic hypoglycemia has been reported in diabetic patients in postmarketing case reports and published epidemiological studies. Management of hypoglycemia in these cases required either discontinuation or dose modification of concomitant medications used for diabetes treatment.</p><p>Frequent monitoring of relevant laboratory parameters (e.g., International Normalized Ratio [INR] in patients taking warfarin, blood glucose levels in diabetic patients) or drug concentrations of concomitant medications such as cytochrome P450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., certain immunosuppressants) is recommended to ensure safe and effective use. Dose adjustments of concomitant medications may be necessary.</p><p>Table 4 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with either sofosbuvir and velpatasvir tablets (400 mg/100 mg), or sofosbuvir and velpatasvir as individual agents, or are predicted drug interactions that may occur with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir</h3><p class="First">Based on drug interaction studies conducted with sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, or sofosbuvir and velpatasvir tablets (400 mg/100 mg) no clinically significant drug interactions have been observed with the following drugs <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:</span></p><ul>
