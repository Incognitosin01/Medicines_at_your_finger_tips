It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, or death.</p><p>Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) can cause breathing problems or meningitis. Hib infection usually affects children and can be fatal.</p><p>Hepatitis B causes inflammation of the liver, vomiting, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes). Hepatitis can lead to liver cancer, cirrhosis, or death.</p><p>Pertussis (whooping cough) causes coughing so severe that it interferes with eating, drinking, or breathing. These spells can last for weeks and can lead to pneumonia, seizures (convulsions), brain damage, and death.</p><p>Polio is a life threatening condition that affects the central nervous system and spinal cord. It can cause muscle weakness and paralysis and can paralyze the muscles that help you breathe.</p><p>Tetanus (lockjaw) causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to "locking" of the jaw so the victim cannot open the mouth or swallow. Tetanus leads to death in about 1 out of 10 cases.</p><p>Vaxelis is used to help prevent these diseases in children. This vaccine helps the body develop immunity to these diseases. Your child will not get these diseases by receiving this vaccine.</p><p> Vaxelis vaccine (Vaxelis) is for use in children between the ages of 6 weeks and 5 years old.</p><p>Like any vaccine, Vaxelis may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Your child should not receive a booster vaccine if he or she had a life threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Your child should not receive Vaxelis if he or she has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any vaccine containing diphtheria, haemophilus B, hepatitis B, pertussis, polio, or tetanus.</p><p>Your child may not be able to receive this vaccine if he or she has:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a weak immune system caused by disease such as cancer, or by using certain medicines such as steroids;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>neurologic problems affecting the brain (or if this was a reaction to a previous vaccine);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a neurologic or brain disorder that is getting worse; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a history of seizure within 3 days after receiving a pertussis vaccine.</p>

<li>
<p>a high fever (105 degrees F or higher);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>collapse or loss of consciousness;</p>
</li>

</ul><p>a high fever (105 degrees F or higher);</p><p>collapse or loss of consciousness;</p><p>excessive crying for 3 hours or longer;</p><p>a seizure (convulsions); or</p><p>This vaccine will not protect against infection with hepatitis A, C, and E, or other viruses that affect the liver. It may also not protect against hepatitis B if your child is already infected with the virus, even if the child does not yet show symptoms.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is this vaccine given?</h2><p>This vaccine is given as an injection (shot) into a muscle.</p><p>Vaxelis is given in a series of shots. The first shot is usually given when the child is 2 months old (or as young as 6 weeks old). The booster shots are then given at 4 months and 6 months of age.</p><p>Your child's individual booster schedule may be different from these guidelines, especially if the child was born prematurely. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by your local health department.</p><p>Your child may receive other vaccines at the same time as receiving Vaxelis.</p><p>Your child may need to receive other vaccines to be completely protected from certain diseases. Be sure your child receives all recommended doses of this vaccine, or the child may not be fully protected against disease.</p><p>This vaccine can affect the results of certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats your child that the child has recently received Vaxelis.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor if your child misses a booster dose or gets behind schedule. The next dose should be given as soon as possible. There is no need to start over.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of this vaccine is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving this vaccine?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">This vaccine side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if your child has <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Your child should not receive a booster vaccine if he or she had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot. Keep track of all side effects your child has. When the child receives a booster dose, tell the doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if your child has:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>breathing that stops during sleep;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>unusual pain or discomfort;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>weakness; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>problems with vision, hearing, or muscle movement.</p>
