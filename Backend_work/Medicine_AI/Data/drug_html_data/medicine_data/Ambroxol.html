When administered orally onset of action occurs after about 30 minutes. The breakdown of acid mucopolysaccharide fibers makes the sputum thinner and less viscous and therefore more easily removed by coughing. Although sputum volume eventually decreases, its viscosity remains low for as long as treatment is maintained.</p><h2>Ambroxol Indications</h2><p>All forms of tracheobronchitis, emphysema with bronchitis pneumoconiosis, chronic inflammatory pulmonary conditions, bronchiectasis, bronchitis with bronchospasm asthma.
