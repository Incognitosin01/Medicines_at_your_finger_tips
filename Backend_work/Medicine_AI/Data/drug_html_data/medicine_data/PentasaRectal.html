Mesalamine <i>suppositories</i> are used to treat mild to moderate active ulcerative proctitis (inflammation of the rectum). It works inside the intestines (bowels) to reduce the inflammation and other symptoms of the disease.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Pentasa</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of mesalamine in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of mesalamine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have blood problems (eg, agranulocytosis, neutropenia, pancytopenia) and age-related kidney, liver, or heart disease, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving mesalamine.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

It may not be specific to Pentasa. Please read with care.</b></p><p><i>Use this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.</p><p>This medicine comes with a patient information insert. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p><i>Keep using this medicine for the full time of treatment</i>, even if you begin to feel better after a few days. Do not miss any doses.</p><p>For best results, empty your bowel just before using the rectal enema or suppository.</p><p>If you are using the <i>enema</i>:</p><ul>
<li>This medicine usually comes with patient directions. Read them carefully before using this medicine.</li>
<li>Remove the bottles from the protective foil pouch, being careful not to squeeze or puncture them. The enema is an off-white to tan color. Contents of the enemas removed from the foil pouch may darken with time. Slight darkening will not affect the potency of the contents. However, enemas with dark brown contents should be discarded.</li>
<li>Shake the bottle well to make sure that the medication is thoroughly mixed. Remove the protective cover from the applicator tip. Hold bottle at the neck so that no medicine spills out.</li>
<li>Lie on your left side with your left leg straight and your right knee bent in front of you for balance. You can also lie in the knee-chest position, on your knees with your chest touching the bed.</li>
<li>Gently insert the rectal tip of the enema applicator pointed slightly toward your naval to prevent damage to the rectal wall. Tilt the nozzle slightly toward the back and squeeze slowly to cause the enema to flow into your rectum. Steady pressure will discharge most of the medicine. After administering, withdraw and discard the bottle.</li>
<li>Remain in position for at least 30 minutes to allow the medicine to distribute thoroughly. Retain the medicine all night if possible.</li>
</ul><p>If you are using the <i>suppository</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Never take rectal suppositories by mouth.</li>
<li>Do not cut or break the suppository.</li>
<li>Remove one suppository from the strip of suppositories. Hold suppository upright and carefully remove the foil wrapper.</li>
<li>Before inserting a suppository, go to the bathroom and empty your bladder and, if possible, have a bowel movement.</li>
<li>This medicine will stain any surface it touches (eg, clothing, bedsheets, floors, countertops, etc.). To protect your clothing, consider wearing a sanitary napkin or adult undergarment such as Depend®. Protect your sheets by placing a waterproof pad on your bed. These pads, often called Chux® pads or underpads, are available from a medical supply store.</li>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using this medicine. Remove the foil or wrapper from the suppository before inserting it.</li>
<li>Do not keep the suppository in your hand too long or it may begin to melt.</li>
<li>To make the suppository easier to insert, you may use a lubricating gel such as K-Y® Jelly, but do not use petroleum jelly (Vaseline®).</li>
<li>Insert suppository (pointed end first) completely into rectum with gentle pressure.</li>
<li>The medicine needs to remain in your body for 1 to 3 hours or longer, depending on your doctor's advice. Try not to use the bathroom for at least that length of time after inserting the suppository.</li>
<li>Drink extra fluids so you will urinate more often and help prevent kidney problems.</li>
