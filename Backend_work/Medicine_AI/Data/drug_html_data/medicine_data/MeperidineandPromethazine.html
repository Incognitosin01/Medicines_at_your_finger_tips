Promethazine may also cause orthostatic hypotension.</p><p>• Photosensitivity: Promethazine may cause photosensitivity; avoid prolonged sun exposure.</p><p>• Respiratory depression: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely for respiratory depression, especially during initiation or dose escalation. </b>Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Patients and caregivers should be educated on how to recognize respiratory depression and the importance of getting emergency assistance immediately (eg, calling 911) in the event of known or suspected overdose.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Abdominal conditions: Meperidine may obscure diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.</p><p>• Acute alcoholism: Use meperidine with caution in patients with acute alcoholism.</p><p>• Adrenal insufficiency: Use meperidine with caution in patients with adrenal insufficiency, including Addison disease.</p><p>• Delirium tremens: Use meperidine with caution in patients with delirium tremens.</p><p>• Drug abuse: Use opioids for chronic pain with caution in patients at increased risk for misuse; factors associated with increased risk include previous substance use disorder, younger age, concomitant depression (major), and psychotropic medication use. Consider offering naloxone prescriptions in patients with factors associated with an increased risk for overdose, such as history of overdose or substance use disorder, higher opioid dosages (≥50 morphine milligram equivalents/day orally), and concomitant benzodiazepine use (CDC [Dowell 2016]).</p><p>• Head trauma: Use meperidine with extreme caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or elevated intracranial pressure (ICP); exaggerated elevation of ICP may occur.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use meperidine with caution in patients with hepatic disorders.</p><p>• Mental health conditions: Use opioids with caution for chronic pain in patients with mental health conditions (eg, depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder) due to increased risk for opioid use disorder and overdose; more frequent monitoring is recommended (CDC [Dowell 2016]).</p><p>• Pheochromocytoma: Use meperidine with caution in patients with pheochromocytoma.</p><p>• Prostatic hyperplasia/urinary stricture: Use meperidine with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia and/or urinary stricture.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use meperidine with caution in patients with renal impairment. Avoid the use of meperidine for pain control in renally-compromised patients (Institute for Safe Medication Practices [ISMP] 2007).</p><p>• Respiratory disease: Use with caution in patients with preexisting respiratory compromise (hypoxia and/or hypercapnia), COPD or other obstructive pulmonary disease, and kyphoscoliosis or other skeletal disorder which may alter respiratory function; critical respiratory depression may occur, even at therapeutic dosages.</p><p>• Seizure disorder: Use promethazine with caution in patients at risk of seizures, including those with a history of seizures, head trauma, brain damage, alcoholism, or concurrent therapy with medications which may lower seizure threshold. In addition, meperidine may cause seizures if high doses are used.</p><p>• Sleep-disordered breathing: Use opioids with caution for chronic pain and titrate dosage cautiously in patients with risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing, including HF and obesity. Avoid opioids in patients with moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing (CDC [Dowell 2016]).</p><p>• Sickle-cell disease: Use meperidine with caution in patients with sickle cell anemia.</p><p>• Tachycardia: Use meperidine with caution in patients with supraventricular tachycardia (including atrial flutter); use may increase ventricular response rate possibly due to a vagolytic effect.</p><p>• Thyroid dysfunction: Use meperidine with caution in patients with thyroid dysfunction, including myxedema and hypothyroidism.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Antiemetic effects: Promethazine may mask toxicity of other drugs or conditions (eg, intestinal obstruction, Reye's syndrome, brain tumor) due to antiemetic effects.</p><p>• Benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of meperidine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosage and durations to the minimum required and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</b> Consider prescribing naloxone for emergency treatment of opioid overdose in patients taking benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants concomitantly with opioids.</p><p>• CYP 3A4 interactions: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Use with all CYP3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in meperidine plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitant CYP 3A4 inducer may result in increased meperidine concentrations. Monitor patients receiving meperidine and any CYP 3A4 inhibitor or inducer.</b></p><p>• MAOI interactions: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Concomitant use of meperidine with MAOIs can result in coma, severe respiratory depression, cyanosis, and hypotension. Use of meperidine with MAOIs within last 14 days is contraindicated.</b></p><p>• Sedatives: Effects may be potentiated when used with other sedative drugs or ethanol. In the setting of chronic pain, avoid prescribing opioids and benzodiazepines concurrently whenever possible; epidemiologic studies suggest there is an increased risk for potentially fatal overdose with concurrent use (CDC [Dowell 2016]).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Elderly: Avoid use in elderly patients (Institute for Safe Medication Practices [ISMP] 2007).</p><p>• Neonates: Neonatal withdrawal syndrome: <b> [US Boxed Warning]: Prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy can cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available</b>. Signs and symptoms include irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. Onset, duration and severity depend on the drug used, duration of use, maternal dose, and rate of drug elimination by the newborn.</p><p>• Pediatric:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Respiratory fatalities have been reported in children &lt;2 years of age. Use contraindicated in children &lt;2 years. In children ≥2 years, use the lowest possible dose; other drugs with respiratory depressant effects should be avoided.</b> Note: use of this fixed dose combination product is not indicated for use in children.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Abuse/misuse/diversion: <b> US Boxed Warning]: Meperidine exposes patients and other users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, potentially leading to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing; monitor all patients regularly for development of these behaviors or conditions.</b> Use with caution in patients with a history of drug abuse or acute alcoholism; potential for drug dependency exists. Other factors associated with increased risk for misuse include younger age, concomitant depression (major), and psychotropic medication use.</p><p>• Accidental ingestion: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Accidental ingestion of even one dose, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of meperidine.</b></p><p>• Appropriate use: This combination product is considered possibly effective by the FDA for the labeled indication. Also consider the warnings/precautions associated with the individual components prior to use.</p><p>- Chronic pain (outside of end-of-life or palliative care, active cancer treatment, sickle cell disease, or medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder) in outpatient setting in adults: Opioids should not be used as first-line therapy for chronic pain management (pain &gt;3-month duration or beyond time of normal tissue healing) due to limited short-term benefits, undetermined long-term benefits, and association with serious risks (eg, overdose, MI, auto accidents, risk of developing opioid use disorder). Preferred management includes nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid therapy (eg. NSAIDs, acetaminophen, certain anticonvulsants and antidepressants). If opioid therapy is initiated, it should be combined with nonpharmacologic and non-opioid therapy, as appropriate. Prior to initiation, known risks of opioid therapy should be discussed and realistic treatment goals for pain/function should be established, including consideration for discontinuation if benefits do not outweigh risks. Therapy should be continued only if clinically meaningful improvement in pain/function outweighs risks. Therapy should be initiated at the lowest effective dosage using immediate-release opioids (instead of extended-release/long-acting opioids). Risk associated with use increases with higher opioid dosages. Risks and benefits should be re-evaluated when increasing dosage to ≥50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day orally; dosages ≥90 MME/day orally should be avoided unless carefully justified (CDC [Dowell 2016]).</p><p>• Naloxone access: Discuss the availability of naloxone with all patients who are prescribed opioid analgesics, as well as their caregivers, and consider prescribing it to patients who are at increased risk of opioid overdose. These include patients who are also taking benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, have an opioid use disorder (OUD) (current or history of), or have experienced a previous opioid overdose. Additionally, health care providers should consider prescribing naloxone to patients prescribed medications to treat OUD; patients at risk of opioid overdose even if they are not taking an opioid analgesic or medication to treat OUD; and patients taking opioids, including methadone or buprenorphine for OUD, if they have household members, including children, or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. Inform patients and caregivers on options for obtaining naloxone (eg, by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, a community-based program) as permitted by state dispensing and prescribing guidelines. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression, proper administration of naloxone, and getting emergency help (FDA 2020).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Pain relief, respiratory and mental status; observe patient for excessive sedation, CNS depression, seizures, respiratory depression.</p><p>Alternate recommendations: Chronic pain (long-term therapy outside of end-of-life or palliative care, active cancer treatment, sickle cell disease, or medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder): Evaluate benefits/risks of opioid therapy within 1 to 4 weeks of treatment initiation and with dose increases. Re-evaluate benefits/risks every 3 months during therapy or more frequently in patients at increased risk of overdose or opioid use disorder. Urine drug testing is recommended prior to initiation and re-checking should be considered at least yearly (includes controlled prescription medications and illicit drugs of abuse). State prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data should be reviewed by clinicians prior to initiation and periodically during therapy (frequency ranging from every prescription to every 3 months) (CDC [Dowell 2016]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p><b>[US Boxed Warnings]: Prolonged use of meperidine during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated.
