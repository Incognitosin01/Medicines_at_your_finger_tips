</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for nitrofurazone</h2><p>Nitrofurazone is used to treat burns that have become infected. It is also used to treat skin infections due to skin grafts. It works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth.</p><p>Nitrofurazone may be applied directly to the skin or placed on a gauze pad that will cover the skin.</p><p>Nitrofurazone is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using nitrofurazone</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For nitrofurazone, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to nitrofurazone or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Studies on nitrofurazone have been done only in adult patients, and there is no specific information comparing use of nitrofurazone in children with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of nitrofurazone in the elderly with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of nitrofurazone. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Kidney disease—Certain ingredients (polyethylene glycols) in the topical solution and the soluble dressing may be absorbed through the skin and may not be eliminated from the body normally in patients with kidney function impairment, which may increase the chance of side effects. Nitrofurazone cream does not contain polyethylene glycol.</li>
