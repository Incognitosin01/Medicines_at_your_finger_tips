If ovaries are abnormally enlarged on the last day of follicle stimulating hormone treatment, follow current clinical practice to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).</p><p>• Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: OHSS is a rare exaggerated response to ovulation induction therapy (Corbett 2014; Fiedler 2012). This syndrome may begin within 24 hours of human chorionic gonadotropin treatment but may become most severe 7 to 10 days after therapy (Corbett 2014). Mild/moderate OHSS signs/symptoms may include abdominal distention/discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and mild/moderate enlargement of ovaries/ovarian cysts. Severe OHSS signs/symptoms may include severe abdominal pain, anuria/oliguria, ascites, severe dyspnea, hypotension, hydrothorax, nausea/vomiting (intractable), pleural effusion, rapid weight gain, venous thrombosis, and large ovarian cysts. Decreased CrCl, hemoconcentration, hypoproteinemia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated WBC, and electrolyte imbalances may also be present (ASRM 2016; Corbett 2014; Fiedler 2012). Treatment is primarily symptomatic and includes fluid and electrolyte management, analgesics, and prevention of thromboembolic complications (ASRM 2016; Shmorgun 2017).</p><p>• Thromboembolism: In association with and separate from OHSS, thromboembolic events have been reported. Risk may be increased in patients with a personal or family history of thromboembolic events, severe obesity, or thrombophilia.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Elderly: Safety and efficacy have not been established in the elderly.</p><p>• Pediatric: Safety and efficacy have not been established in children.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Experienced physician: These medications should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.</p><p>• Multiple births: May result from the use of these medications; advise patients of the potential risk of multiple births before starting the treatment.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Ultrasound and/or estradiol levels to assess follicle development; ultrasound to assess number and size of follicles; ovulation (basal body temperature, serum progestin level, menstruation, sonography)</p><p>OHSS: Monitoring of hospitalized patients should include abdominal circumference, albumin, cardiorespiratory status, electrolytes, fluid balance, hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum creatinine, urine output, urine specific gravity, vital signs, weight (all daily or as necessary) and liver enzymes (weekly) (SOGC-CFAS 2011)</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Chorionic gonadotropin (recombinant) is approved to be used as part of an assisted reproductive technology (ART) program; for use only by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management. Multiple births may result from use of this medication.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Chorionic gonadotropin (recombinant) is approved to be used as part of an assisted reproductive technology (ART) program; use is contraindicated in an established pregnancy.</p><p>Ectopic pregnancy, premature labor, postpartum fever, and spontaneous abortion have been reported in clinical trials. Congenital abnormalities have also been observed; however, the incidence is similar during natural conception.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to help women get pregnant.</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
