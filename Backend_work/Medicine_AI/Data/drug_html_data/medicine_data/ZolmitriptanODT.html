</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Zolmitriptan ODT</h2><p class="First">Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Only use zolmitriptan if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to zolmitriptan treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before zolmitriptan is administered to treat any subsequent attacks.</li>
<li>Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks.</li>
<li>Safety and effectiveness of zolmitriptan have not been established for cluster headache.</li>
</ul><h2>Zolmitriptan ODT Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosing Information</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 5 mg.</p><p>In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose.</p><p>If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period.</p><p>The safety of zolmitriptan in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established.</p><h3>Administration of Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets</h3><p class="First">Instruct patients not to break zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets because they are not functionally-scored.</p><p>Administration with liquid is not necessary.</p><p>Orally disintegrating tablets are packaged in a blister pack. Instruct patients not to remove the tablet from the blister until just prior to dosing. Subsequently, instruct patients to peel the blister pack open, and to place the orally disintegrating tablet on the tongue, where it will dissolve and it will be swallowed with the saliva.</p><h3>Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of zolmitriptan in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day.</p><p>The use of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment because these orally disintegrating tablets should not be broken in half [see <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Dosing in Patients taking Cimetidine</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">If zolmitriptan is coadministered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24 hour period [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">2.5 mg tablets are white/mottled white to cream white, round, flat-faced uncoated tablet, debossed with '715' on one side and plain on other the side.</p><p>5 mg tablets are white/mottled white to cream white round, biconvex, beveled, uncoated tablet, debossed with '717' on one side and plain on the other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>  Ischemic coronary artery disease (angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, or documented silent ischemia), other significant underlying cardiovascular disease, or <span class="Italics">c</span> oronary artery vasospasm including Prinzmetal's angina [see<span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span> ].</li>
<li>  Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see<span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span> ].</li>
<li>  History of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or history of hemiplegic or basilar migraine because these patients are at a higher risk of stroke [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span> ].</li>
<li>  Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span> ].</li>
<li>  Ischemic bowel disease [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span> ]</li>
<li>  Uncontrolled hypertension [see<span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span> ].</li>
<li>  Recent use (i.e., within 24 hours) of another 5-HT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sub">1</span></span> agonist, ergotamine-containing medication, or ergot-type medication (such as dihydroergotamine or methysergide) [see<span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.3)</span> ].</li>
<li>  Concurrent administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A inhibitor or recent use of a MAO-A inhibitor (that is within 2 weeks) [see<span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span> ].</li>
<li>  Known hypersensitivity to zolmitriptan (angioedema and anaphylaxis seen) [see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span> ].</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina</h3><p class="First">Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD)<span class="Italics">.</span> There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan.  Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT<span class="Bold"><span class="Sub">1</span></span> agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.</p><p>Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-na√Øve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan.  Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration.  For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan.</p><h3>Arrhythmias</h3><p class="First">Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><h3>Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure</h3><p class="First">As with other 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal's variant angina [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Cerebrovascular Events</h3><p class="First">Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not.</p><p>As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><h3>Other Vasospasm Reactions</h3><p class="First">5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><p>Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists have not been clearly established.</p><h3>Medication Overuse Headache</h3><p class="First">Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.5)]</span>. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)<span class="Italics">.</span> The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.4)</span>].</p><h3>Increase in Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mmHg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mmHg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria</h3><p class="First">Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 2.5 mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 2.51 mg phenylalanine. Each 5 mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 5.01 mg phenylalanine.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</li>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (<span class="Bold">&gt;</span> 5% and &gt; placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth.</p><p>Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in <span class="Bold">&gt;</span> 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14)</span>]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included.</p><p>Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">*</span>Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included.</p><p>There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials in the following subgroups: gender, weight, age, use of prophylactic medications, or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets</span></span></p><p>In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients).</p><p><span class="Italics">General</span></p><p>Infrequent were allergic reactions.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular</span></p><p>Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Neurological</span></p><p>Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia.</p><p> <span class="Italics">Skin</span></p><p>Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria.</p><p> <span class="Italics">Urogenital</span></p><p>Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Oral Disintegrating Tablets</span></span></p><p>The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity Reactions</span></span></p><p>As with other 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Ergot-containing Drugs</h3><p class="First">Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions.  Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><h3>MAO-A Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>5-HT1B/1D agonists</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of other 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><h3>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</span>].</p><h3>Cimetidine</h3><p class="First">Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span> If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration, (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of zolmitriptan in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span></p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2%- 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Clinical Considerations</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</span></p><p>Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Data</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) ‚âà280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was a dose-related increase in embryolethality. A no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs ‚âà1, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with a plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs ‚âà70, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with a plasma AUC ‚âà280 times that in humans at the MRHD.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of zolmitriptan or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of zolmitriptan and its metabolites on milk production. In rats, oral dosing with zolmitriptan resulted in levels in milk up to 4 times that in maternal plasma.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for zolmitriptan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolmitriptan or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, zolmitriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age.</p><p>One randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of zolmitriptan tablets (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) evaluated 696 pediatric patients (aged 12 to 17 years) with migraines. This study did not demonstrate the efficacy of zolmitriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions in the adolescent patients treated with zolmitriptan were similar in nature and frequency to those reported in clinical trials in adults treated with zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan has not been studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years old.</p><p>In the postmarketing experience with triptans, including zolmitriptan, there were no additional adverse reactions seen in pediatric patients that were not seen in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of zolmitriptan did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) prior to receiving zolmitriptan [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan were similar in geriatric patients (aged &gt; 65 years) compared to younger patients [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Patients with Hepatic Impairment:</h3><p class="First">After oral zolmitriptan administration, zolmitriptan blood levels were increased in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some of these patients [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>]. Therefore, adjust the zolmitriptan dose and administer with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12)</span>].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no experience with acute overdose of zolmitriptan. Clinical study subjects who received single 50 mg oral doses of zolmitriptan commonly experienced sedation.</p><p>There is no specific antidote to zolmitriptan. In cases of severe intoxication, intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system.</p><p>The elimination half-life of zolmitriptan is 3 hours [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)</span>]; therefore, monitor patients after overdose with zolmitriptan for at least 15 hours or until symptoms or signs resolve. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan.</p><h2>Zolmitriptan ODT Description</h2><p class="First">Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contain zolmitriptan, which is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> (5 -HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span>) receptor agonist. Zolmitriptan is chemically designated as (S)-4-[[3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-1H-indol-5-yl]methyl]-2-oxazolidinone and has the following chemical structure:</p><p>The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">16</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>, representing a molecular weight of 287.36. </p><p>Zolmitriptan, USP is white to off-white crystalline powder that is freely soluble to soluble in methanol and soluble in water, sparingly soluble in dichloromethane, practically insoluble in toluene.</p><p>Each zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet USP, intended for oral administration,contains 2.5 mg or 5 mg of zolmitriptan USP. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: anhydrous citric acid, aspartame, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, gelatin, magnesium stearate,mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose,  orange flavor, polacrilin potassium and sodium stearyl fumarate.</p><h2>Zolmitriptan ODT - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT<span class="Sub">1D</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B</span> receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span> receptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> and moderate affinity for 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span> receptors.</p><p>Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system.  The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arteriovenous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both zolmitriptan   tablet s and the zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets.

In Study 1, patients treated their headaches in a clinic setting. In the other studies, patients treated their headaches as outpatients. In Study 4, patients who had previously used sumatriptan were excluded, whereas in the other studies no such exclusion was applied.</p><p>Patients enrolled in these 5 studies were predominantly female (82%) and Caucasian (97%) with a mean age of 40 years (range 12 to 65). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed at 1, 2, and, in most studies, 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours post-dose. A second dose of zolmitriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for persistent and recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also recorded. In all studies, the effect of zolmitriptan was compared to placebo in the treatment of a single migraine attack.</p><p>In all five studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients who received zolmitriptan tablets at all doses (except for the 1 mg dose in the smallest study) compared to those who received placebo. In Studies 1 and 3, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the higher dose groups (2.5 and/or 5 mg) compared to the 1 mg dose group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2.5 and 5 mg dose groups (or of doses up to 20 mg) for the primary end point of headache response at 2 hours in any study.
