<span class="Bold">Lice Treatment Creme Rinse</span></p><p><span class="Bold">THE FACTS OF LICE</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Please read all information before using Nix Creme Rinse.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">If you or a member of your household has head lice, don't panic. Keep calm.</span></p><p>Anyone can get head lice - <span class="Bold">it has nothing to do with cleanliness or poor hygiene.</span> Head lice are treatable and very rarely cause serious health problems.</p><p><span class="Bold">What are head lice?</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>head lice are small insects that live and feed on the human scalp</li>
<li>they may get as big as sesame seeds and are brown</li>
<li>lice do not fly or jump from one person to another. They can only crawl.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">What are nits?</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>nits are lice eggs laid on the hair near the scalp. One louse may lay over 100 nits.</li>
<li>nits are oval shaped, tiny and greyish-white</li>
<li>they are attached to hair with a waterproof glue-like substance that cannot be washed out or blown away</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Because nits (eggs) hatch in about one week, all nits must be removed to stop lice.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">How do head lice spread?</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>head lice spread easily from close head-to-head or hand-to-head contact with persons who have lice</li>
<li>they may also spread by sharing hats, helmets, scarves, headphones, brushes, combs, bedding and clothing</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">How do you know if you have lice?</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>itching is the most common symptom</li>
<li>scratching behind the ears or the back of the neck is a sign that you should check for head lice</li>
<li>scabs or blood spots may be seen</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">How do you prevent the spread of lice?</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>do not share or borrow personal items like combs, brushes, or headbands</li>
<li>do not share or borrow hats, sweaters, coats, scarves, helmets, headphones, pillows or stuffed animals</li>
<li>store hats in coat sleeves and hang coats separately, so that they do not touch other people's hats and coats</li>
<li>wash under fingernails when you first see lice or nits (eggs)</li>
<li>check your child's head daily when you hear of a lice outbreak in day care or school</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">I. Inspect</span></p><p><span class="Bold Italics">If you suspect head lice - check. Head lice may be hard to locate because they avoid light. Nits are easier to see.</span></p><ul class="Disc">
