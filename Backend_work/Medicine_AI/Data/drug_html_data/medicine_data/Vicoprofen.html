Hydrocodone is an opioid pain medication. An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). This medicine works by reducing substances in the body that cause pain, fever, and inflammation.</p><p>Vicoprofen is used short-term to relieve severe pain.</p><p>Vicoprofen is not for treating arthritis pain.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Taking Vicoprofen during pregnancy may cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the newborn.</b></p><p>Hydrocodone can slow or stop your breathing, and may be habit-forming. <b>MISUSE OF VICOPROFEN CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b></p><p><b>Fatal side effects can occur if you use Vicoprofen with alcohol, or with other drugs that cause drowsiness or slow your breathing.</b></p><p>Ibuprofen can increase your risk of fatal heart attack or stroke, especially if you use it long term or take high doses, or if you have heart disease. Do not use Vicoprofen just before or after heart bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG).</p><p>Ibuprofen may also cause stomach or intestinal bleeding, which can be fatal. These conditions can occur without warning while you are using ibuprofen, especially in older adults.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Vicoprofen if you are allergic to hydrocodone or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or if you have ever had an asthma attack or severe allergic reaction after taking aspirin or an NSAID. <b>Do not use this medicine just before or after heart bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG).</b></p><p>Ibuprofen can increase your risk of fatal heart attack or stroke, especially if you use it long term or take high doses, or if you have heart disease. Even people without heart disease or risk factors could have a stroke or heart attack while taking Vicoprofen.</p><p>Ibuprofen may also cause stomach or intestinal bleeding, which can be fatal. These conditions can occur without warning while you are using Vicoprofen, especially in older adults.</p><p>To make sure Vicoprofen is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Be sure your doctor knows if you also take stimulant medicine, opioid medicine, herbal products, or medicine for depression, mental illness, Parkinson's disease, migraine headaches, serious infections, or prevention of nausea and vomiting. Ask your doctor before making any changes in how or when you take your medications.</p><p><b>If you use hydrocodone while you are pregnant, your baby could become dependent on the drug.</b> This can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the baby after it is born. Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant.</p><p>Hydrocodone and ibuprofen can pass into breast milk and cause drowsiness or breathing problems in a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding.</p><h2>How should I take Vicoprofen?</h2><p>Take Vicoprofen exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Hydrocodone can slow or stop your breathing. Never take this medicine in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Use the lowest dose that is effective in treating your condition. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain.</p><p>Hydrocodone may be habit-forming. Never share Vicoprofen with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. <b>MISUSE OF NARCOTIC MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Selling or giving away Vicoprofen is against the law.</p><p>If you need surgery, tell the surgeon ahead of time that you are using Vicoprofen. You may need to stop using the medicine for a short time.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep track of your medicine. Hydrocodone is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your Vicoprofen improperly or without a prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Pain:</b></p><p>For short-term (generally less than 10 days) management of acute pain:<br/>
