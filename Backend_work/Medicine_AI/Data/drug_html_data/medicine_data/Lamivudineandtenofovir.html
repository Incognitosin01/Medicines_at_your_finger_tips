Ask your doctor about your risk.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, and use your medications properly to control your infection. HIV can be passed to your baby if the virus is not controlled during pregnancy.

Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk.</p><h2>How should I take lamivudine and tenofovir?</h2><p>Your doctor will perform blood tests to make sure you do not have conditions that would prevent you from safely using this medicine.</p><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets.
