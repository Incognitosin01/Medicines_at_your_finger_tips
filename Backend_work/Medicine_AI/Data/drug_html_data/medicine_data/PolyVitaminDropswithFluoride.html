</ul><h2>Poly Vitamin Drops with Fluoride Description</h2><p class="First">This product does not contain the essential vitamin folic acid.</p><p>See <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span> section below for use by infants and young children 6 months to 3 years of age.</p><p><span class="Bold">Active ingredient for caries prophylaxis:</span> Fluoride as sodium fluoride.</p><p><span class="Bold">Other Ingredients:</span> Ascorbic acid, caramel color, cherry flavor, cholecalciferol, cyanocobalamin, ferrous sulfate, glycerin, methylparaben, niacinamide, oil of orange, polysorbate 80, purified water, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin-5-phosphate sodium, sodium benzoate, sodium hydroxide, thiamine hydrochloride, d-alpha tocopheryl acid succinate, vitamin A palmitate. Citric acid may be added to adjust pH.</p><h2>Poly Vitamin Drops with Fluoride - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries.</p><p>Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the <span class="Italics">hydroxyapatite</span> in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, <span class="Italics">fluorapatite</span>. The reaction may be expressed by the equation:<span class="Bold">1</span></p><p></p><p>Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished:<span class="Bold">1</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Poly Vitamin Drops with Fluoride</h2><p class="First">Supplementation of the diet with nine essential vitamins.</p><p>Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxis. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplementation.</p><p>Multivitamin and Fluoride 0.25 mg drops provide fluoride in drop form for infants and young children 6 months to 3 years of age, in areas where the drinking water contains less than 0.3 ppm of fluoride and for children ages 3-6 years, in areas where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride. Each 1.0 mL supplies sodium fluoride (0.25 mg fluoride) plus nine essential vitamins.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics<span class="Bold">2</span> and the American Dental Association<span class="Bold">3</span> currently recommend that infants and young children 6 months to 3 years of age, in areas where drinking water contains less than 0.3 ppm of fluoride, and children 3-6, in areas where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride, receive 0.25 mg of supplemental fluoride daily which is provided in a full dose (1 mL) of Multivitamin and Fluoride 0.25 mg drops. A half dose (0.5 mL) of Multivitamin and Fluoride Drops 0.5 mg drops could also provide a daily fluoride intake of 0.25 mg; however, this dosage reduces vitamin supplementation by half.</p><p>Multivitamin and Fluoride 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg drops supply significant amounts of vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiences of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, infants and children obtain nine essential vitamins and fluoride.</p><p>A comprehensive 5-1/2 year series of studies of the effectiveness of Tri-Vi-Flor® and Poly-Vi-Flor® products in caries protection has been published.<span class="Bold">4-7</span> Children in this continuing study lived in an area where the water supply contained only 0.05 ppm fluoride. The subjects were divided into two groups, one which used only non-fluoridated Vi-Sol® vitamin products and the other Tri-Vi-Flor® and Poly-Vi-Flor® vitamin-fluoride products.</p><p>The three-year interim report showed 63% fewer carious surfaces in primary teeth and 43% fewer carious surfaces in permanent teeth of the children taking Vi-Flor® vitamin-fluoride products.<span class="Bold">4</span></p><p>After four years the studies continued to support the effectiveness of Tri-Vi-Flor® and Poly-Vi-Flor®, showing a reduction in carious surfaces of 68% in primary teeth and 46% in permanent teeth.<span class="Bold">5</span> Results at the end of 5-1/2 years further confirmed the previous findings and indicated that significant reductions in dental caries are apparent with the continued use of Vi-Flor® vitamin-fluoride products.<span class="Bold">6</span></p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">As in the case of all medications, keep out of reach of children.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">The suggested dose should not be exceeded since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. When prescribing vitamin fluoride products:</p><p>Multivitamin and Fluoride Drops 0.25 mg should be dispensed in the original plastic container, since contact with glass leads to instability and precipitation. (The amount of sodium fluoride in the 50-mL size is well below the maximum to be dispensed at one time according to recommendations of the American Dental Association.)</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Allergic rash and other idiosyncrasies have been rarely reported.</p><p>To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co., Inc. at 1-800-262-9010.</p><h2>Poly Vitamin Drops with Fluoride Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">1.0 mL daily or as prescribed by physician. May be dropped directly into mouth with dropper; or mixed with cereal, fruit juice or other food.</p><h2>How is Poly Vitamin Drops with Fluoride Supplied</h2><p class="First">Multivitamin and Fluoride 0.25 mg drops are available in 50 mL bottles with accompanying calibrated dropper.</p><h3>RECOMMENDED STORAGE:</h3><p class="First">Store at controlled room temperature, 15º-30ºC (59º-86ºF). After opening, store away from direct light. Close tightly after each use. Occasional deepening of color has no significant effect on vitamin potency.</p><p><span class="Bold">REFRIGERATION IS NOT REQUIRED</span></p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First"><br/>
