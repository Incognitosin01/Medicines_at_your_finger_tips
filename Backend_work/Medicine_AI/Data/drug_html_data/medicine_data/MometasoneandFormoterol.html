However, regular treatment with ICS has been shown to increase the risk of pneumonia, especially in those with severe disease. Combination therapy is recommended in patients with a history of hospitalization(s) for exacerbations of COPD, ≥2 moderate exacerbations of COPD per year, blood eosinophils &gt;300 cells/microliter, and concomitant or history of asthma. Combination therapy may also be considered in patients with 1 moderate exacerbation of COPD per year and blood eosinophils of 100 to 300 cells/microliter <sup>[GOLD 2019]</sup>.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to mometasone, formoterol, or any component of the formulation; status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Cardiac tachyarrhythmias; untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or parasitic infections, active tuberculous infection of the respiratory tract, or ocular herpes simplex.</p><p>Documentation of allergenic cross-reactivity for corticosteroids and/or sympathomimetics  are limited. However, because of similarities in chemical structure and/or pharmacologic actions, the possibility of cross-sensitivity cannot be ruled out with certainty.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Asthma:</b><b> Note</b>: The recommended starting dose is based upon asthma severity and previous asthma therapy (including inhaled corticosteroid dosage). Titrate to the lowest effective dose (step down) once asthma is well controlled after 2 to 3 months (GINA 2020). The maximum dose is based on the formoterol component; to increase the dose of the inhaled glucocorticoid component, a separate inhaler with a higher mometasone dose per inhalation must be prescribed.</p><p>Oral inhalation: Metered-dose inhaler: Two inhalations twice daily of mometasone 100 mcg/formoterol 5 mcg or mometasone 200 mcg/formoterol 5 mcg (maximum dose: mometasone 200 mcg/formoterol 5 mcg [2 inhalations] twice daily).</p><p><b>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (stable) (off-label use):</b> Oral inhalation: Metered-dose inhaler: Mometasone 200 mcg/formoterol 10 mcg to mometasone 400 mcg/formoterol 10 mcg twice daily (Doherty 2012; GOLD 2018; GOLD 2019).</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy: </b>Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance.

Prior to first use, prime inhaler by releasing 4 test sprays into the air; shake well before each spray. Inhaler must be reprimed if not used for &gt;5 days; shake well before each use. Discard inhaler after the labeled number of inhalations have been used. Use canister only with provided actuator; do not use with canisters or actuators from other products. Do not remove the canister from the actuator; the correct amount of medication may not be discharged; the dose counter may not function properly; reinsertion may cause the dose counter to count down by 1 and discharge a puff.</p><p>Delivery of dose: Place mouthpiece between lips and inhale deeply and hold breath for up to 10 seconds (or as long as you comfortably can); do not exhale through inhaler. Wait ≥30 seconds prior to the second inhalation dose; may use with or without spacer. Rinse mouth/oropharynx with water and spit out rinse solution (without swallowing) after each use. Do not wash inhaler with water; clean mouthpiece using a dry wipe every 7 days.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at  20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions are permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F); temperatures above 49°C (120°F) may cause bursting. Contents under pressure; do not puncture, incinerate, or store near heat or open flame. Discard inhaler after the labeled number of inhalations have been used (the dose counter will read “0”). The 120-actuation inhaler may be stored in any position; store the 60-actuation inhaler with the mouthpiece down or in a horizontal position after priming.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Aldesleukin: Corticosteroids may diminish the antineoplastic effect of Aldesleukin. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>AtoMOXetine: May enhance the tachycardic effect of Beta2-Agonists.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>AtoMOXetine: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics.

HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis. Withdrawal and discontinuation of a corticosteroid should be done slowly and carefully. Particular care is required when patients are transferred from systemic corticosteroids to inhaled products due to possible adrenal insufficiency or withdrawal from steroids, including an increase in allergic symptoms. Adult patients receiving ≥20 mg per day of prednisone (or equivalent) may be most susceptible. Fatalities have occurred due to adrenal insufficiency in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to aerosol steroids; aerosol steroids do <b>not</b> provide the systemic steroid needed to treat patients having trauma, surgery, or infections. Do not use this product to transfer patients from oral corticosteroid therapy.</p><p>• Asthma-related deaths: The use of long-acting beta-2 agonists (LABAs) as monotherapy has been associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations and asthma-related deaths (SMART 2006; Walters 2007); additional data from other clinical trials suggests risk of asthma-related hospitalization may also be increased with LABA monotherapy in pediatric and adolescent patients. However, data from large randomized, double-blind controlled trials do not show a significant increase in risk of serious asthma related events (including hospitalizations, intubations, and death) in adults, adolescents, and pediatric patients (aged 4 to 11 years) when fixed-dose LABAs are used with inhaled corticosteroids combined in a single inhaler compared with inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy (FDA 2017). Current guidelines recommend the use of an as-needed low-dose inhaled corticosteroid with formoterol for patients with infrequent symptoms (GINA 2020).</p><p>• Bronchospasm: Rarely, paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with use of inhaled bronchodilating agents; this should be distinguished from inadequate response.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (allergic dermatitis, angioedema, bronchospasm, flushing, rash, urticaria) have been reported.</p><p>• Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may increase the incidence of secondary infection, mask acute infection (including fungal infections), prolong or exacerbate viral infections, or limit response to vaccines. Avoid use if possible in patients with ocular herpes; active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; or untreated viral, fungal, or bacterial or parasitic systemic infections. Exposure to chickenpox or measles should be avoided; if the patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin, may be indicated; if chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. If exposure to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin may be indicated.</p><p>• Kaposi sarcoma: Prolonged treatment with corticosteroids has been associated with the development of Kaposi sarcoma (case reports); if noted, discontinuation of therapy should be considered (Goedert 2002).</p><p>• Oral candidiasis: Local oropharyngeal <i>Candida</i> infections have been reported; if this occurs, treat appropriately while continuing mometasone/formoterol therapy. Patients should be instructed to mouth/oropharynx with water (without swallowing) and spit out rinse solution after each use.</p><p>• Psychiatric disturbances: Corticosteroid use may cause psychiatric disturbances, including depression, euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, and personality changes. Preexisting psychiatric conditions may be exacerbated by corticosteroid use.</p><p>• Serious effects/fatalities: Do not exceed recommended dose; serious adverse events, including fatalities, have been associated with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetics.</p><p>• Vasculitis: Rare cases of vasculitis (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [formerly known as Churg-Strauss]) or other systemic eosinophilic conditions can occur; often associated with decrease and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following initiation of inhaled corticosteroid.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Asthma: Appropriate use: Supplemental steroids (oral or parenteral) may be needed during stress or severe asthma attacks. Not to be used in status asthmaticus. In patients presenting to primary care or acute care facility, short-acting beta-2 agonists are recommended for the acute management of exacerbations (GINA 2020).</p><p>• Bone density: Use with caution in patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral count such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (eg, anticonvulsants or oral corticosteroids); high doses and/or long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with decreases in bone mineral density.</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (arrhythmia, coronary insufficiency, or hypertension); beta agonists may cause elevation in blood pressure, heart rate and result in CNS stimulation/excitation. Beta-2 agonists may also increase risk of arrhythmias and ECG changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. Use with caution following acute myocardial infarction; corticosteroids have been associated with myocardial rupture.</p><p>• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus; beta-2 agonists may increase serum glucose and aggravate ketoacidosis; corticosteroids may alter glucose production/regulation leading to hyperglycemia.</p><p>• Gastrointestinal disease: Use corticosteroids with caution in patients with GI diseases (diverticulitis, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis) due to perforation risk.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Monitor patients with hepatic impairment; may lead to accumulation of mometasone.</p><p>• Hypokalemia: Use with caution in patients with hypokalemia; beta-2 agonists may decrease serum potassium (transient), possibly through intracellular shunting.</p><p>• Myasthenia gravis: Use with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis; exacerbation of symptoms has occurred, especially during initial treatment with corticosteroids.</p><p>• Ocular disease: Use with caution in patients with cataracts and/or glaucoma; increased intraocular pressure, open-angle glaucoma, and cataracts have occurred with prolonged use. Consider routine eye exams in chronic users.</p><p>• Pheochromocytoma: Use with caution in patients with pheochromocytoma; beta agonists may stimulate the sympathetic nervous system.</p><p>• Seizure disorders: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders; beta agonists may result in CNS stimulation/excitation.</p><p>• Thyroid disease: Changes in thyroid status may necessitate dosage adjustments; metabolic clearance of corticosteroids increases in hyperthyroid patients and decreases in hypothyroid ones.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Pediatric: LABAs may increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients (~1 centimeter per year [range 0.3 to 1.8 cm per year] and related to dose and duration of exposure). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, each patient should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. Growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Discontinuation of systemic corticosteroid therapy: Withdraw systemic corticosteroid therapy with gradual tapering of dose. Monitor lung function, beta agonist use, asthma symptoms, and for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, hypotension) during withdrawal.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>FEV<sub>1</sub>, peak flow meter, and/or other pulmonary function tests; monitor growth in pediatric patients, symptom relief, monitor for increased use if short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonists (may be a sign of asthma deterioration); HPA axis suppression; bone mineral density; blood pressure, heart rate; CNS stimulation; serum glucose, serum potassium; eye exams (chronic users)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this combination.
