</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Wilate, von Willebrand Factor/Coagulation Factor VIII Complex</h2><p class="First">WILATE is indicated in children and adults with von Willebrand disease for:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>On-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes</li>
<li>Perioperative management of bleeding</li>
</ul><p>WILATE is not indicated for the treatment of hemophilia A.</p><h2>Wilate, von Willebrand Factor/Coagulation Factor VIII Complex Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For Intravenous Use after Reconstitution</span></p><h3>Dose</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Initiate treatment under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of coagulation disorders.</li>
<li>Each vial of WILATE contains the labeled amount in International Units (IU) of von Willebrand factor (VWF) activity as measured with the Ristocetin cofactor assay (VWF:RCo), and coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) activity measured with the chromogenic substrate assay.</li>
<li>The number of units of VWF:RCo and FVIII activities administered is expressed in IU, which is related to the current WHO standards for VWF and FVIII products. VWF:RCo and FVIII activities in plasma are expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IU (relative to the International Standards for VWF:RCo and FVIII activities in plasma). One IU of VWF:RCo activity is equivalent to the quantity of VWF:RCo in one mL of normal human plasma. The ratio between VWF:RCo and FVIII activities in WILATE is approximately 1:1.</li>
<li>Calculate the required dosage of VWF:RCo, based on the empirical finding that 1 IU VWF:RCo per kg body weight raises the plasma VWF activity by approximately 2% of normal activity or 2 IU/dL, using the following formula:</li>

<li>Perform appropriate laboratory tests on the patient’s plasma at suitable intervals to assure that adequate VWF:RCo and FVIII activity levels have been reached and are maintained.</li>
<li>Because WILATE contains FVIII, continued treatment may cause an excessive rise in FVIII activity.</li>

<li>Prior to surgery, measure incremental in vivo recovery (IVR) and assess baseline plasma VWF:RCo activity. The IVR for VWF:RCo provides the IU/dL rise per IU/kg body weight infused and can be measured and calculated as follows:</li>
<li>Measure plasma VWF:RCo at baseline</li>
<li>Infuse 60 IU VWF:RCo/kg of WILATE intravenously at time 0</li>
<li>Measure plasma VWF:RCo at 30 minutes after the infusion</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>Calculation of the loading dose requires four values: the target peak plasma VWF:RCo level, the baseline VWF:RCo level, body weight (BW) in kilograms, and IVR. If the actual IVR calculation exceeds 2.5, use 2.5 to calculate the recommended loading dosing to avoid under-dosing. If IVR is not available, a standardized dose can be calculated based on an assumed VWF:RCo IVR of 2.0 U/dL per IU/kg of WILATE administered.</li>
</ul><p>Assumption: Baseline VWF:RCo value = 10 IU/dL, and VWF:RCo target level = 100 IU/dL = Δ 90 IU/dL</p><p>Assumption: Patient’s weight = 75 kg, patient’s IVR = 1.8 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg)</p><p>/</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>When possible post surgery, perform appropriate laboratory tests on the patient’s plasma once a day after surgery to assure that adequate VWF:RCo and FVIII activity levels have been reached and are maintained. In order to decrease the risk of perioperative thrombosis, FVIII activity levels should not exceed 2 50%. [ 2 ]</li>
</ul><h3>Preparation and Reconstitution</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>WILATE is provided with a Mix2VialTM transfer device for reconstitution of the freeze-dried powder in diluent, a 10 mL syringe, an infusion set and two alcohol swabs.</li>
<li>Reconstitute the powder only directly before injection. Because WILATE contains no preservatives, use the solution immediately after reconstitution.</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Instructions for Reconstitution:</span></p><p class="First">/</p><p>1) Warm the concentrate (WILATE) and Diluent in the closed vials up to room temperature. If a water bath is used for warming, avoid water contact with the rubber stoppers or the caps of the vials. The temperature of the water bath should not exceed +37°C (98°F).</p><p>2) Remove the caps from the concentrate (WILATE) vial and the diluent vial and clean the rubber stoppers with an alcohol swab.</p><p class="First">/</p><p>3) Peel away the lid of the outer package of the Mix2Vial™ transfer set. To maintain sterility, leave the Mix2Vial™ device in the clear outer packaging. Place the diluent vial on a level surface and hold the vial firmly. Take the Mix2Vial™ in its outer package and invert it over the diluent vial. Push the blue plastic cannula of the Mix2Vial™ firmly through the rubber stopper of the diluent vial (Fig. 1). While holding onto the diluent vial, remove the outer package from the Mix2Vial™, leaving the Mix2Vial™ attached firmly to the diluent vial (Fig. 2).</p><p class="First">/</p><p>4) With the concentrate (WILATE) vial held firmly on a level surface, quickly invert the diluent vial with the Mix2Vial™ attached and push the transparent plastic cannula end of the Mix2Vial™ firmly through the stopper of the concentrate (WILATE) vial (Fig. 3). The diluent will be drawn into the concentrate (WILATE) vial by the vacuum. With both vials still attached, immediately start swirling the concentrate (WILATE) vial to ensure the powder is fully saturated. A slight whirlpool is formed by swirling. In order to avoid foaming, please do not shake the vial.</p><p class="First">/</p><p>5) After 30 seconds, firmly hold both the transparent and blue parts of the Mix2Vial™. Unscrew the Mix2Vial™ into two separate pieces (Fig. 4) and discard the empty diluent vial and the blue part of the Mix2Vial™. Continue swirling until the powder in the WILATE vial has completely dissolved. This process may take several minutes.</p><p>The final solution is clear or slightly opalescent, colorless or slightly yellow. If the concentrate fails to dissolve completely or an aggregate is formed, do not use the preparation.</p><h3>Administration</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For intravenous injection after reconstitution only</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">WILATE is available as a sterile, lyophilized powder for reconstitution for intravenous injection, provided in the following nominal strengths per single-use vial:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>500 IU VWF:RCo and 500 IU FVIII activities in 5 mL</li>
<li>1000 IU VWF:RCo and 1000 IU FVIII activities in 10 mL</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">WILATE is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic or severe systemic reactions, to human plasma-derived products, any ingredient in the formulation [see Description ( 11 )], or components of the container.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions may occur with WILATE. Signs and symptoms include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, generalized urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, and wheezing that may progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock) with or without fever.[ 3 ] Closely monitor patients receiving WILATE and observe for any symptoms throughout the infusion period.</p><p>Because inhibitor antibodies may occur concomitantly with anaphylactic reactions, evaluate patients experiencing an anaphylactic reaction for the presence of inhibitors.[ 3 ] [See Warnings and Precautions (5. 3 )]</p><h3>Thromboembolic Events</h3><p class="First">Continued treatment using a FVIII-containing VWF product may cause an excessive rise in FVIII activity[ 1 ], which may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Monitor plasma levels of VWF:RCo and FVIII activities in patients receiving WILATE to avoid sustained excessive VWF and FVIII activity levels.</p><h3>Neutralizing Antibodies</h3><p class="First">Neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to FVIII and VWF in patients with VWD, especially type 3 patients, may occur. If a patient develops inhibitor to VWF (or to FVIII), the condition will manifest itself as an inadequate clinical response. Thus, if expected VWF activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an adequate dose or repeated dosing, perform an appropriate assay to determine whether a VWF inhibitor is present.</p><p>In patients with antibodies against VWF, VWF is not effective and WILATE administration may lead to severe adverse events. Consider other therapeutic options for such patients.</p><p>Because inhibitor antibodies may occur concomitantly with anaphylactic reactions, evaluate patients experiencing an anaphylactic reaction for the presence of inhibitors.[ 3 ] [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</p><h3>Transmissible Infectious Agents</h3><p class="First">WILATE is made from human plasma. Because this product is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and theoretically, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) agent. There is also the possibility that unknown infectious agents may be present in the product. The risk that WILATE will transmit viruses has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing for the presence of certain current virus infections, and by inactivating and removing certain viruses during manufacture. Despite these measures, it may still potentially transmit disease. [ 5 ]</p><p>Record the batch number of the product every time WILATE is administered to a patient, and consider appropriate vaccination (against hepatitis A and B virus) of patients in regular/repeated receipt of WILATE. ALL infections thought by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to Octapharma USA, Inc., at 1-866-766-4860.</p><h3>Monitoring and Laboratory Tests</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Monitor plasma levels of VWF:RCo and FVIII activities in patients receiving WILATE to avoid sustained excessive VWF and FVIII activity levels, which may increase the risk of thromboembolism, particularly in patients with known clinical or laboratory risk factors.</li>
<li>Monitor for development of VWF and FVIII inhibitors. Perform assays to determine whether VWF and/or FVIII inhibitor(s) is present if bleeding is not controlled with the expected dose of WILATE. [ 6 ]</li>
</ul><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most common adverse reactions to treatment with WILATE (≥ 1%) in patients with VWD were hypersensitivity reactions, urticaria, and dizziness. Seroconversions for antibodies to parvovirus B19 not accompanied by clinical signs of disease have been observed.</p><p><span class="Italics">The most serious adverse reactions to treatment with WILATE in patients with VWD were hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed during these trials cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>A total of 157 VWD subjects (aged 1 to 83 years) received WILATE on 6769 occasions, including clinical studies that involved prophylactic use, treatment on demand, surgery, and pharmacokinetics. Of the 157 subjects, 32 (20.4%) had VWD type 1, 42 (26.8%) had VWD type 2, and 83 (52.9%) had VWD type 3; 96 (61.1%) subjects were female and 61 (38.9%) subjects were male. Overall, subjects received 11,222,241 IU of WILATE during 6355 exposure days. The most common adverse reactions were hypersensitivity reactions (3 subjects; 1.9%), urticaria and dizziness (each with 2 subjects; 1.3%). Five subjects (3.2%) showed seroconversion for antibodies to parvovirus B19 not accompanied by clinical signs of disease. Seroconversion for parvovirus B19 DNA has not been reported since implementation of minipool testing of plasma used for the manufacture of WILATE.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immunogenicity</span></p><p>The immunogenicity of WILATE was specifically assessed in 97 subjects in 3 clinical studies in which subjects received 9,635,041 IU of WILATE during 5575 exposure days. No inhibitors of VWF were detected in these 3 studies. In one of 3 studies, which also assessed FVIII inhibitor development in 15 subjects, no inhibitors of FVIII were detected after administration of a total of 223,290 IU of WILATE over 419 administrations.</p><p>The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to WILATE with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of WILATE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to product exposure.</p><p>Post-marketing adverse reactions reported in patients treated with WILATE include, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, rash, headache, tachycardia, flushing, hypotension, chills, cough, chest discomfort, abdominal pain, pyrexia, factor VIII inhibition, anaphylactic reaction and paresthesia.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no data with WILATE use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with WILATE. WILATE was given to four subjects (3 type 3 and 1 type 2B) during labor and delivery in one clinical study. Two subjects underwent vaginal delivery (type 3) and two subjects had a cesarean section (type 3/type 2B). In this study all procedures were uneventful.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, regardless of drug exposure, the estimated background risk of major birth defect and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of WILATE in human milk, the effect on the breastfed infant, and the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for WILATE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from WILATE or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Eleven pediatric subjects with VWD between 5 to 16 years of age (8 type 3, 1 type 2, 2 type 1) were treated with WILATE for 234 bleeding episodes (BEs) in clinical studies. Treatment success was achieved in 88% of BEs [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Efficacy data during surgical prophylaxis were available for 13 pediatric VWD surgery subjects (3 subjects aged 0 to 2 years, 4 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 3 subjects aged 6 to 12 years, and 3 subjects aged 12 to 16 years). Treatment success was achieved in 22 of 22 surgical procedures (17 minor and 5 major).</span></p><p>No dose adjustment is needed for pediatric patients as administered dosages were similar to those used in the adult population [see Clinical Trials ( 14 )].</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Although some of the subjects who participated in the WILATE studies were over 65 years of age, the number of subjects was inadequate to allow subgroup analysis to support recommendations in the geriatric population.</p><h2>Wilate, von Willebrand Factor/Coagulation Factor VIII Complex Description</h2><p class="First">WILATE is a human plasma-derived, sterile, purified, double virus inactivated von Willebrand Factor/Coagulation Factor VIII Complex. WILATE is supplied as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution for intravenous injection. The diluent for reconstitution of the lyophilized powder is Water for Injection with 0.1% Polysorbate 80.</p><p>WILATE contains no preservative. No albumin is added as a stabilizer. WILATE is labeled with the actual VWF:RCo and FVIII activities in IU per vial. The VWF activity (VWF:RCo) is determined using a manual agglutination method referenced to the current “WHO International Standard for von Willebrand Factor Concentrate”. The FVIII activity is determined using a chromogenic substrate assay referenced to the current “WHO International Standard for Human Coagulation Factor VIII Concentrate”. The assay methodologies are according to European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur.). The resulting specific activity of WILATE is ≥ 60 IU VWF:RCo and ≥ 60 IU FVIII activities per mg of total protein.</p><p>The nominal composition of WILATE is as follows:</p><p class="First">VWF:RCo</p><p class="First">500 IU</p><p class="First">1000 IU</p><p class="First">FVIII</p><p class="First">500 IU</p><p class="First">1000 IU</p><p class="First">Total protein</p><p class="First">≤ 7.5 mg</p><p class="First">≤ 15.0 mg</p><p class="First">Glycine</p><p class="First">50 mg</p><p class="First">100 mg</p><p class="First">Sucrose</p><p class="First">50 mg</p><p class="First">100 mg</p><p class="First">Sodium chloride</p><p class="First">117 mg</p><p class="First">234 mg</p><p class="First">Sodium citrate</p><p class="First">14.7 mg</p><p class="First">29.4 mg</p><p class="First">Calcium chloride</p><p class="First">0.8 mg</p><p class="First">1.5 mg</p><p class="First">Water for injection</p><p class="First">5 mL</p><p class="First">10 mL</p><p class="First">Polysorbate 80</p><p class="First">1 mg/mL</p><p class="First">1 mg/mL</p><p>Von Willebrand Factor/Coagulation Factor VIII complex is the active ingredient in WILATE. It is derived from large pools of human plasma collected in U.S. plasma donation centers. All plasma donations are tested for viral markers in compliance with requirements of EU CPMP and FDA guidance. In addition, the limit for the titer of human parvovirus B19 DNA in the manufacturing pool is set not to exceed 10 <span class="Sup">4</span> IU/mL.</p><p>The product is manufactured from cryoprecipitate, which is reconstituted in a buffer and treated with aluminum hydroxide followed by two different chromatography steps, ultra- and diafiltration, and sterile filtration. The manufacturing process includes two virus inactivation steps, namely, treatment with an organic solvent/detergent (S/D) mixture, composed of tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP) and Octoxynol-9, and a terminal dry heat (TDH) treatment of the lyophilized product in final container [at +100°C (212°F) for 120 minutes at a specified residual moisture level of 0.7-1.6%]. In addition, the ion-exchange chromatography step utilized during WILATE manufacturing also removes some viruses [ 8 ].

VWF promotes platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion on damaged vascular endothelium; it also serves as a stabilizing carrier protein for the procoagulant protein FVIII, an essential cofactor in activation of factor X leading to formation of thrombin and fibrin. Patients suffering from VWD have a deficiency or abnormality of VWF. This reduction in VWF plasma concentration results in correspondingly low FVIII activity and abnormal platelet function, thereby resulting in excessive bleeding. [ 9 ] After administration, WILATE temporarily replaces missing VWF and FVIII that are needed for effective hemostasis.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">There have been no specific pharmacodynamic studies on WILATE.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of WILATE were determined by FVIII activity, VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, and VWF:CB obtained from an open label, prospective, randomized, controlled, two-arm cross-over study with WILATE and a comparator product conducted at 6 sites in the US. Twenty-two subjects with inherited VWD [type 1, n=6; type 2, n=9 (6 type 2A, 1 type 2B, and 2 type 2M); and type 3, n=7] received an intravenous bolus dose of WILATE containing approximately 40 IU of VWF:RCo/kg body weight. Twenty subjects completed the study as per protocol. PK parameters for VWF:RCo and FVIII activities are summarized in Table 4 and Table 5 , respectively.</p><p>The PK parameters reported in Table 4 are based on VWF:RCo values obtained using a modified Behring Coagulation System (BCS) analytical method. The modified BCS was used because of its validated lower variability compared with the standard BCS.

For inclusion in the studies, subjects had to have inherited VWD (any type) that did not respond to desmopressin acetate. Subjects aged ≥12 to ≤65 years were eligible to enter three of the four studies, and subjects aged ≥6 to ≤85 years were eligible for one study. Exclusion criteria included the administration of other plasma-derived or blood products or desmopressin acetate 15 days before study entry, administration of acetylsalicylic acid 7 days before study entry, symptomatic infection, past or present inhibitor activity (3 studies), and severe liver or kidney disease (3 studies). A total of 70 VWD subjects with a mean age of 37 years (range 5–77 years) were enrolled in the studies, of whom 37 were type 3 and 30 were male. The total number of exposure days to WILATE for all investigations across the four studies ranged from 202 to 4917 days. Treated BEs were analyzed for efficacy using a set of objective criteria in addition to a subjective 4-point hemostatic efficacy scale (excellent, good, moderate and none) which was determined at the discretion of the investigator. In assessing efficacy using the objective criteria, treatment of a bleeding episode was classified as a success when none of the criteria listed below were met:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>the episode was additionally treated with another VWF-containing product (excluding whole blood)</li>
<li>the subject received a blood transfusion during the episode</li>
<li>follow-up treatment with a daily dosage of WILATE that was greater than or equal to 50% (≥ 50%) above the initial dose (for bleeding episodes with more than 1 day of treatment)</li>
<li>treatment duration of more than 4 days (&gt; 4 days) in cases of severe bleeding (other than gastrointestinal)</li>
<li>treatment duration of more than 3 days (&gt; 3 days) in cases of moderate bleeding (other than gastrointestinal)</li>
<li>treatment duration of more than 2 days (&gt; 2 days) in cases of minor bleeding (other than gastrointestinal)</li>
<li>the last efficacy rating of the bleeding episode was 'moderate' or 'none'</li>
</ul><p>BEs treated with WILATE are summarized for all subjects (n=45) and subjects aged 5–16 years (n=11) in Table 6 . Among the 70 VWD subjects administered WILATE in clinical studies (excluding the PK study), 45 received on demand treatment for 1068 BEs. Using the above objective criteria, corresponding efficacy for each bleeding event was rated as being successful in 84% of the episodes. In these 45 subjects with BEs, 93% of the successfully treated BEs occurred in VWD type 3 subjects (n=25). In 11 pediatric patients aged 5–16 years, efficacy was rated as being successful in 87.6% of BEs.</p><p> <span class="Bold">Table 6 Proportion of Successful Treatments of Bleeding Episodes with WILATE</span></p><p class="First">All subjects (n=45)</p><p class="First">1068</p><p class="First">898</p><p class="First">84.1 (81.8-86.2</p><p class="First">Subjects 5–16 years (n=11)</p><p class="First">234</p><p class="First">205</p><p class="First">87.6 (82.7-91.5)</p><p>Dosing information for 972 successfully treated “bleeding episodes” (1423 infusions), and 211 successfully treated bleeding episodes (289 infusions) in subjects aged 5–16 years, for regional bleeding is summarized in Table 7 . For the purpose of assigning success/failure to regional bleeding that occurred at the same time, bleeding at different sites over the same time span was counted as separate BEs. Thus, the number of these “episodes” is different from that in the overall evaluation for success/failure of WILATE in the treatment of BEs in Table 6 . The majority of BEs were treated for 1-3 days. In subjects with GI bleeds, the duration for product use to control bleeding was longer (up to 7 days).</p><p> <span class="Bold">Table 7 Administered Dosages (VWF:RCo in IU/kg) in Bleeding Episodes* Successfully Treated with WILATE: Mean ± SD (Range)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">/</span></p><p>*For the purpose of this analysis, bleeding at each site is counted as a separate “episode”.</p><p>**“Other” includes mostly muscle bleeds, hematuria, ecchymosis, hematoma and other miscellaneous sites of bleeding.</p><p><span class="Bold">Prevention of Bleeding in Surgery (Perioperative Management)</span></p><p>A prospective, open-label, single-arm, uncontrolled, multi-center clinical study was conducted to investigate the safety and hemostatic efficacy of WILATE in 28 subjects (19 female and 9 male) who underwent 30 surgeries.

Six subjects had type 1 VWD, 1 had type 2A, 1 type 2B, and 20 had type 3 VWD. One type 1 and one type 3 subject had 2 surgeries each.</p><p>Twenty-one surgeries were classified as major (e.g. orthopedic joint replacement, cesarean section and vaginal deliveries, laminectomy, tonsillectomy, appendectomy, 3 <span class="Sup">rd</span> molar extractions) and 9 were classified as minor (e.g. menisectomy, teeth extractions other than 3 <span class="Sup">rd</span> molars, septoplasty, biopsy). Seven surgeries (3 major, 4 minor) were performed in type 1 VWD subjects, 2 surgeries (1 major, 1 minor) were performed in type 2 (A/B) VWD subjects, and 21 surgeries (17 major, 4 minor) were performed in type 3 VWD subjects. The types of surgery for the 9 minor procedures were: dental (n=5, 55.6%); orthopedic (n=2, 22.2%); ophthalmologic (n=1, 11.1%); and ear, nose and throat (n=1, 11.1%). The types of surgery for the 21 major procedures were: orthopedic (n=8, 38.1%); obstetric/gynecological (n=5, 23.8%); gastrointestinal (n=4, 19.0%); dental (n=2, 9.5%); and ear, nose and throat (n=2, 9.5%).

Mean total loading dose per infusion was 51.4 IU/kg (median 52.1 IU/kg; range 27-77 IU/kg). Major surgeries required a mean loading dose of 54.7 IU/kg (median 55.5 IU/kg; range 36-69 IU/kg) in comparison with a mean loading dose of 41.9 IU/kg (median 37.5 IU/kg; range 27−77 IU/kg) for minor surgeries. Mean total maintenance dose per infusion was 28.5 IU/kg (median 28.5 IU/kg; range 8-63 IU/kg).

Efficacy of WILATE was assessed using a stringent and objective 4-point ordinal efficacy scale (excellent, good, moderate, or none) based on estimated expected versus actual blood loss, transfusion requirements and post-operative bleeding and oozing. A rating of excellent or good was required to declare the outcome a success. An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) additionally conducted an independent post hoc adjudication of intra- and post-operative assessments made by the surgeon/investigator-hematologist. In situations where the IDMC’s assessment differed from that of the surgeon and/or investigator-hematologist, the IDMC assessment took priority.</span></p><p>The overall efficacy of WILATE treatment for surgical procedures in this study was 96.7%. Treatment with WILATE was successful in all minor surgeries and in 95.2% of major surgeries ( Table 13 ). It was also successful in all surgical procedures in VWD type 3 and type 2 subjects and in 85.7% of procedures in VWD type 1 subjects ( Table 14 ). One failure was reported in a VWD type 1 subject undergoing lumbar laminectomy (major surgery) who experienced slightly greater blood loss (25 mL) than the expected maximum (20 mL).</p><p> <span class="Bold">Table 13 Hemostatic Efficacy Assessment by Severity of Surgery as Adjudicated by the IDMC (n=30)</span></p><p class="First">Efficacy grade</p><p class="First">n (%)</p><p class="First">Rate</p><p class="First">98.75% CI</p><p class="First">n (%)</p><p class="First">Rate</p><p class="First">98.75% CI</p><p class="First">n (%)</p><p class="First">Rate</p><p class="First">98.75% CI</p><p class="First">Success</p><p class="First">9 (100)</p><p class="First">1.000</p><p class="First">0.569, 1.000</p><p class="First">20 (95.2)</p><p class="First">0.952</p><p class="First">0.704, 1.000</p><p class="First">29 (96.7)</p><p class="First">0.967</p><p class="First">0.784, 1.000</p><p class="First">Failure</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">1 (4.8)</p><p class="First">1 (3.3)</p><p> <span class="Bold">Table 14 Hemostatic Efficacy Assessment by Type of VWD as Adjudicated by the IDMC (n=30)</span></p><p class="First">Efficacy grade</p><p class="First">n (%)</p><p class="First">Rate</p><p class="First">98.75% CI</p><p class="First">n (%)</p><p class="First">Rate</p><p class="First">98.75% CI</p><p class="First">n (%)</p><p class="First">Rate</p><p class="First">98.75% CI</p><p class="First">Overall IDMC assessment</p><p class="First">Success</p><p class="First">6 (85.7)</p><p class="First">0.857</p><p class="First">0.328, 0.999</p><p class="First">2 (100)</p><p class="First">1.000</p><p class="First">0.079, 1.000</p><p class="First">21 (100)</p><p class="First">1.000</p><p class="First">0.785, 1.000</p><p class="First">Failure</p><p class="First">1 (14.3)</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">0</p><p>In this study, actual blood loss (median) was lower than the expected maximal estimated blood loss in all types of surgeries.

Before it can be infused in your vein (intravenous injection), you must mix the powder with the supplied liquid diluent.</p><p>Do not attempt to do an infusion to yourself unless you have been taught how by your healthcare provider or hemophilia center.</p><p>Always follow the specific instructions given by your healthcare provider. The steps listed below are general guidelines for using WILATE. If you are unsure of the procedures, please call you healthcare provider before using WILATE. Your healthcare provider will prescribe the dose that you should take.</p><p><span class="Bold">Preparation and Reconstitution</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>WILATE is provided with a Mix2VialTM transfer device for reconstitution of the WILATE powder in diluent.</li>
<li>Reconstitute the powder only directly before injection.</li>
<li>Because WILATE contains no preservatives, use the solution immediately after reconstitution.</li>
</ul><p class="First">/</p><p>1) Warm the WILATE and diluent vials in the closed vials up to room temperature. If a water bath is used for warming, avoid water contact with the rubber stoppers or the caps of the vials. The temperature of the water bath should not exceed +37°C (98°F).</p><p>2) Remove the caps from the WILATE vial and the diluent vial and clean the rubber stoppers with an alcohol swab.</p><p class="First">/</p><p>3) Peel away the lid of the outer package of the Mix2Vial™ transfer set. To maintain sterility, leave the Mix2Vial™ device in the clear outer packaging. Place the diluent vial on a level surface and hold the vial firmly. Take the Mix2Vial™ in its outer package and invert it over the diluent vial. Push the blue plastic cannula of the Mix2Vial™ firmly through the rubber stopper of the diluent vial (Fig. 1). While holding onto the diluent vial, remove the outer package from the Mix2Vial™, leaving the Mix2Vial™ attached firmly to the diluent vial (Fig. 2).</p><p class="First">/</p><p>4) With the WILATE vial held firmly on a level surface, quickly invert the diluent vial with the Mix2Vial™ attached and push the transparent plastic cannula end of the Mix2Vial™ firmly through the stopper of the WILATE vial (Fig. 3). The diluent will be drawn into the WILATE vial by the vacuum. With both vials still attached, immediately start swirling the concentrate (WILATE) vial to ensure the powder is fully saturated. A slight whirlpool is formed by swirling. In order to avoid foaming, please do not shake the vial.</p><p class="First">/</p><p>5) After 30 second, firmly hold both the transparent and blue parts of the Mix2Vial™. Unscrew the Mix2Vial™ into two separate pieces(Fig. 4) and discard the empty diluent vial and the blue part of the Mix2Vial™. Continue swirling until the powder in the WILATE vial has completely dissolved. This process may take several minutes.</p><p>The final solution is clear or slightly opalescent, colorless or slightly yellow. If the concentrate fails to dissolve completely or an aggregate is formed, do not use the preparation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Administration</span></p><p><span class="Bold">For intravenous use after reconstitution only.</span></p><p>For more product information on WILATE, please visit www.wilateusa.com</p><p><span class="Bold">Manufactured by</span></p><p>Octapharma Pharmazeutika Produktionsges.m.b.H., Oberlaaer Strasse 235, A-1100 Vienna, Austria</p><p>U.S. License No. 1646</p><p><span class="Bold">Distributed by</span></p><p>Octapharma USA, Inc., 121 River Street, 12 <span class="Sup">th</span> floor, Hoboken, NJ 07030</p><p>wilate® is a registered trademark of Octapharma.</p><p>Issued September 2016.</p><p class="First">von Willebrand Factor/Coagulation Factor VIII Complex (Human)</p><p><span class="Bold">Octapharma Pharmazeutika Produktionsges.m.b.H</span></p><p><span class="Bold">500IU/5mL</span></p><p>NDC 68982-182-01</p><p>/</p><p><span class="Bold">1000IU/10mL</span></p><p>NDC 68982-182-02</p><p>/</p><h2>More about antihemophilic factor / von willebrand factor</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
