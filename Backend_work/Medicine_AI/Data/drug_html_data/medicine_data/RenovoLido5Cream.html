KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.</p><p>Precautions</p><p>If irritation or sensitivity occurs or infection appears, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Renovo Lido5 Cream should be used with caution in ill, elderly, debilitated patients and children who may be more sensitive to the systemic effects of lidocaine.</p><p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility:</p><p>Studies of lidocaine in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential of the effect on fertility have not been conducted.</p><p>USE IN PREGNANCY:</p><p>Teratogenic Effects; Pregnancy Category B.</p><p>Reproduction studies have been performed for lidocaine in rats at doses up to 6.6 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus caused by lidocaine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. General consideration should be given to this fact before administering lidocaine to women of childbearing potential, especially during early pregnancy when maximum organogenesis takes place.</p><p>NURSING MOTHERS:</p><p>Lidocaine is excreted in human milk. The clinical significance of this observation is unknown. Caution should be exercised when lidocaine is administered to a nursing woman.</p><p>PEDIATRIC USE:</p><p>Dosage in pediatric patients should be reduced commensurate with age, body weight, and physical condition.</p><p>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</p><p>During or immediately after treatment, the skin at the site of treatment may develop erythema or edema or may be the locus of abnormal sensation.</p><p>CALL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p><span class="Bold">Instructions for Use</span></p><p>Clean and dry affected area<br/>
