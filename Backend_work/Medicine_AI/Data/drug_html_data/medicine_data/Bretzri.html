</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Bretzri</h2><p class="First">BREZTRI AEROSPHERE is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p><p><span class="Italics">Limitations of Use:</span></p><p>BREZTRI AEROSPHERE is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or for the treatment of asthma <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions</span> <span class="Italics">(5.1</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">5.2)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h2>Bretzri Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosage and Administration</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE is budesonide 320 mcg, glycopyrrolate 18 mcg and formoterol fumarate 9.6 mcg (administered as 2 inhalations of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE [budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate 160 mcg/9 mcg/4.8 mcg]) twice daily in the morning and in the evening by oral inhalation. Do not take more than two inhalations twice daily.</p><p>After inhalation, rinse mouth with water without swallowing.</p><h3>Preparation</h3><p class="First">Prime BREZTRI AEROSPHERE before using for the first time. Priming BREZTRI AEROSPHERE is essential to ensure appropriate drug content in each actuation. Prime BREZTRI AEROSPHERE by releasing 4 sprays into the air away from the face, shaking well before each spray.</p><p>If the inhaler has not been used for more than 7 days, is dropped, or after weekly cleaning, prime the inhaler again by releasing 2 sprays into the air away from the face, shaking well before each spray.</p><h3>Dose counter</h3><p class="First">BREZTRI AEROSPHERE canister has an attached dose indicator, which indicates how many inhalations remain. The dose indicator display will move after every tenth actuation. When nearing the end of the usable inhalations, the color behind the number in the dose indicator display window changes to red. BREZTRI AEROSPHERE should be discarded when the dose indicator display window shows zero.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Inhalation Aerosol: a pressurized metered dose inhaler that delivers a combination of 160 mcg budesonide, 9 mcg glycopyrrolate, and 4.8 mcg formoterol fumarate per inhalation.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">BREZTRI AEROSPHERE is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to budesonide, glycopyrrolate, formoterol, or any of the excipients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Description (11)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Serious Asthma-Related Events – Hospitalizations, Intubations, Death</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE in patients with asthma have not been established. BREZTRI AEROSPHERE is not indicated for the treatment of asthma.</p><p>Use of long-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic agonists (LABA) as monotherapy [without inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)] for asthma is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death. Available data from controlled clinical trials also suggest that use of LABA as monotherapy increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. These findings are considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy. When a LABA is used in fixed-dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone.</p><p>Available data do not suggest an increased risk of death with use of LABA in patients with COPD.</p><h3>Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes</h3><p class="First">BREZTRI AEROSPHERE should not be initiated in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD, which may be a life-threatening condition. BREZTRI AEROSPHERE has not been studied in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD. The use of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE in this setting is not appropriate.</p><p>BREZTRI AEROSPHERE should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. BREZTRI AEROSPHERE has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist.</p><p>When beginning treatment with BREZTRI AEROSPHERE, patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., four times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing BREZTRI AEROSPHERE, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. Increasing inhaled beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist use is a signal of deteriorating disease for which prompt medical attention is indicated.</p><p>COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If BREZTRI AEROSPHERE no longer controls symptoms, or the patient’s inhaled, short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist becomes less effective or the patient needs more inhalations of short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting, re-evaluate the patient and the COPD treatment regimen at once. The daily dosage of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE should not be increased beyond the recommended dose.</p><h3>Avoid Excessive Use of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE and Avoid Use with other Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists</h3><p class="First">As with other inhaled drugs containing beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic agents, BREZTRI AEROSPHERE should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medications containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using BREZTRI AEROSPHERE should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><h3>Oropharyngeal Candidiasis</h3><p class="First">BREZTRI AEROSPHERE contains budesonide, an ICS. Localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with <span class="Italics">Candida albicans</span> have occurred in subjects treated with orally inhaled drug products containing budesonide. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with BREZTRI AEROSPHERE continues. In some cases, therapy with BREZTRI AEROSPHERE may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing following administration of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.</p><h3>Pneumonia</h3><p class="First">Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, have been reported following the inhaled administration of corticosteroids. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbations frequently overlap.</p><p>In a 52-week trial of subjects with COPD (n = 8,529), the incidence of confirmed pneumonia was 4.2% for BREZTRI AEROSPHERE 320 mcg/18 mcg/9.6 mcg (n = 2144), 3.5% for budesonide, glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate [BGF MDI 160 mcg/18 mcg/9.6 mcg] (n = 2124), 2.3% for GFF MDI 18 mcg/9.6 mcg (n = 2125) and 4.5% for BFF MDI 320 mcg/9.6 mcg (n = 2136).</p><p>Fatal cases of pneumonia occurred in 2 subjects receiving BGF MDI 160 mcg/18 mcg/9.6 mcg, 3 subjects receiving GFF MDI 18 mcg/9.6 mcg, and no subjects receiving BREZTRI AEROSPHERE 320 mcg/18 mcg/9.6 mcg.</p><p>In a 24-week trial of subjects with COPD (n = 1,896), the incidence of confirmed pneumonia was 1.9% for BREZTRI AEROSPHERE 320 mcg/18 mcg/9.6 mcg (n = 639), 1.6% for glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate [GFF MDI 18 mcg/9.6 mcg] (n = 625) and 1.9% for budesonide and formoterol fumarate [BFF MDI 320 mcg/9.6 mcg] (n = 320). There were no fatal cases of pneumonia in the study.</p><h3>Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections</h3><p class="First">Patients who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affects the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated (see the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information). If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</p><p>ICS should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.</p><h3>Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HPA Suppression/Adrenal Insufficiency</span></p><p>Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to ICS because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available ICS. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.</p><p>Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although BREZTRI AEROSPHERE may provide control of COPD symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does not provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.</p><p>During periods of stress, or a severe COPD exacerbation, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their healthcare practitioner for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress, or a severe COPD exacerbation.</p><p>Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to BREZTRI AEROSPHERE. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with BREZTRI AEROSPHERE. Lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>] or morning peak expiratory flow [PEF]), beta-agonist use, and COPD symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Unmasking of Allergic Conditions Previously Suppressed by Systemic Corticosteroids</span></p><p>Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to BREZTRI AEROSPHERE may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions).</p><p><span class="Bold">Corticosteroid Withdrawal Symptoms</span></p><p>During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.</p><h3>Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression</h3><p class="First">Inhaled budesonide is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active. Effects of budesonide on the HPA axis are not observed with the therapeutic doses of budesonide in BREZTRI AEROSPHERE. However, exceeding the recommended dosage or coadministration with a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor may result in HPA dysfunction <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><p>Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of ICS, patients treated with BREZTRI AEROSPHERE should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.</p><p>It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, appropriate therapy should be initiated as needed.</p><h3>Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE with long-term ketoconazole, and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) because adverse effects related to increased systemic exposure to budesonide may occur <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Paradoxical Bronchospasm</h3><p class="First">As with other inhaled therapies, BREZTRI AEROSPHERE can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with BREZTRI AEROSPHERE, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; BREZTRI AEROSPHERE should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy should be instituted.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions including Anaphylaxis</h3><p class="First">Immediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported after administration of budesonide, glycopyrrolate or formoterol fumarate, the components of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE. If signs suggesting allergic reactions occur, in particular, angioedema (including difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of tongue, lips, and face), urticaria, or skin rash, BREZTRI AEROSPHERE should be stopped at once and alternative treatment should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Cardiovascular Effects</h3><p class="First">Formoterol fumarate, like other beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and also cardiac arrhythmias, such as supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p>If such effects occur, BREZTRI AEROSPHERE may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiographic changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression, although the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, BREZTRI AEROSPHERE should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.</p><h3>Reduction in Bone Mineral Density</h3><p class="First">Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing ICS. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. Since patients with COPD often have multiple risk factors for reduced BMD, assessment of BMD is recommended prior to initiating BREZTRI AEROSPHERE and periodically thereafter. If significant reductions in BMD are seen and BREZTRI AEROSPHERE is still considered medically important for that patient's COPD therapy, use of therapy to treat or prevent osteoporosis should be strongly considered.</p><p>In a subset of COPD patients in a 24-week trial with a 28-week safety extension that evaluated BREZTRI AEROSPHERE 320/18/9.6 mcg and GFF MDI 18/9.6 mcg, the effects on BMD endpoints were evaluated. BMD evaluations were performed at baseline and 52-weeks using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans. Mean percent changes in BMD from baseline was -0.1% for BREZTRI AEROSPHERE 320/18/9.6 mcg and 0.4% for GFF MDI 18/9.6 mcg <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><h3>Glaucoma and Cataracts, Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma</h3><p class="First">Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients with COPD following the long-term administration of ICS or with use of inhaled anticholinergics. BREZTRI AEROSPHERE should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use BREZTRI AEROSPHERE long term.</p><p>In a 52-week trial that evaluated BREZTRI AEROSPHERE 320/18/9.6 mcg, GFF MDI 18/9.6 mcg, and BFF MDI 320/9.6 mcg in subjects with COPD, the incidence of cataracts ranged from 0.7% to 1.0% across groups.</p><h3>Worsening of Urinary Retention</h3><p class="First">BREZTRI AEROSPHERE, like all therapies containing an anticholinergic, should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop.</p><h3>Coexisting Conditions</h3><p class="First">BREZTRI AEROSPHERE, like all therapies containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.</p><h3>Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia</h3><p class="First">Beta-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist therapies may produce transient hyperglycemia in some patients.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE is based on the safety data from one 52-week exacerbation trial (Trial 1) and one 24-week lung function trial with a 28-week safety extension study, resulting in up to 52 weeks of treatment (Trial 2). In Trials 1 and 2, a total of 2783 subjects have received at least 1 dose of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE 320 mcg/18 mcg/9.6 mcg <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><p>In Trials 1 and 2, subjects received one of the following treatments: BREZTRI AEROSPHERE 320 mcg/18 mcg/9.6 mcg, glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate [GFF MDI 18 mcg/9.6 mcg], or budesonide and formoterol fumarate [BFF MDI 320 mcg/9.6 mcg]. Each treatment was administered twice daily.</p><p>In Trial 1, a 52-week, randomized, double-blind clinical trial, a total of 2144 subjects with COPD received at least 1 dose of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE 320 mcg/18 mcg/9.6 mcg (mean age: 64.7 years, 84.9% Caucasian, 59.7% male across all treatments) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>In Trial 2, a 24-week, randomized, double-blind clinical trial, with a 28-week long-term safety extension resulting in up to 52 weeks of treatment, a total of 639 subjects received at least 1 dose of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE 320 mcg/18 mcg/9.6 mcg (mean age: 65.2 years, 50.1% Caucasian, 71.2% male across all treatments) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>The incidence of adverse reactions from the 52-week trial (Trial 1) is presented in Table 1 for subjects treated with BREZTRI AEROSPHERE 320 mcg/18 mcg/9.6 mcg, GFF MDI 18 mcg/9.6 mcg, or BFF MDI 320 mcg/9.6 mcg.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reaction</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">BREZTRI AEROSPHERE</span>*</p><p><span class="Bold">320 mcg/18 mcg/9.6 mcg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N=2144 (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">GFF MDI</span>*</p><p><span class="Bold">18 mcg/9.6 mcg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N=2125 (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">BFF MDI</span>*</p><p><span class="Bold">320 mcg/9.6 mcg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N=2136 (%)</span></p><p class="First">Upper Respiratory Tract Infection</p><p class="First">123 (5.7)</p><p class="First">102 (4.8)</p><p class="First">115 (5.4)</p><p class="First">Pneumonia</p><p class="First">98 (4.6)</p><p class="First">61 (2.9)</p><p class="First">107 (5.0)</p><p class="First">Back pain</p><p class="First">67 (3.1)</p><p class="First">55 (2.6)</p><p class="First">64 (3.0)</p><p class="First">Oral candidiasis</p><p class="First">65 (3.0)</p><p class="First">24 (1.1)</p><p class="First">57 (2.7)</p><p class="First">Influenza</p><p class="First">63 (2.9)</p><p class="First">42 (2.0)</p><p class="First">61 (2.9)</p><p class="First">Muscle spasms</p><p class="First">60 (2.8)</p><p class="First">19 (0.9)</p><p class="First">53 (2.5)</p><p class="First">Urinary tract infection</p><p class="First">58 (2.7)</p><p class="First">60 (2.8)</p><p class="First">41 (1.9)</p><p class="First">Cough</p><p class="First">58 (2.7)</p><p class="First">50 (2.4)</p><p class="First">51 (2.4)</p><p class="First">Sinusitis</p><p class="First">56 (2.6)</p><p class="First">47 (2.2)</p><p class="First">55 (2.6)</p><p class="First">Diarrhea</p><p class="First">44 (2.1)</p><p class="First">37 (1.7)</p><p class="First">38 (1.8)</p><p>In 24-week data from Trial 2, adverse reactions that occurred in subjects treated with BREZTRI AEROSPHERE 320 mcg/18 mcg/9.6 mcg (n=639) at an incidence of ≥ 2% included dysphonia (3.3%) and muscle spasms (3.3%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Additional Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Other adverse reactions that have been associated with one or more of the individual components of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE include: hyperglycemia, anxiety, insomnia, headache, palpitations, nausea, hypersensitivity, depression, agitation, restlessness, nervousness, tremor, dizziness, angina pectoris, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, and extrasystoles), throat irritation, bronchospasm, dry mouth, bruising, urinary retention, chest pain, sign or symptoms of systemic glucocorticoid steroid effects (e.g., hypofunctional adrenal gland), and abnormal behavior.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with BREZTRI AEROSPHERE.</p><h3>Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4</h3><p class="First">The main route of metabolism of corticosteroids, including budesonide, a component of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE, is via cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4). After oral administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, the mean plasma concentration of orally administered budesonide increased. Concomitant administration of a CYP3A4 inhibitor may inhibit the metabolism of, and increase the systemic exposure to, budesonide. Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.9)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>Adrenergic Drugs</h3><p class="First">If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution because the sympathetic effects of formoterol, a component of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE, may be potentiated <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Xanthine Derivatives, Steroids, or Diuretics</h3><p class="First">Concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, or diuretics may potentiate the hypokalemic effect of beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic agonists such as formoterol, a component of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE.</p><h3>Non-Potassium Sparing Diuretics</h3><p class="First">The hypokalemia and/or ECG changes that may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist is exceeded.</p><h3>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors, Tricyclic Antidepressants, QTc Prolonging Drugs</h3><p class="First">BREZTRI AEROSPHERE, as with other beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists, should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants or other drugs known to prolong the QTc interval because the action of adrenergic agonists on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents. Drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval may be associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias.</p><h3>Beta-adrenergic Receptor Blocking Agents</h3><p class="First">Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and BREZTRI AEROSPHERE may interfere with the effect of each other when administered concurrently. Beta-blockers not only block the therapeutic effects of beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists, but may produce severe bronchospasm in COPD patients. Therefore, patients with COPD should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-blockers in patients with COPD. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.</p><h3>Anticholinergics</h3><p class="First">There is a potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Therefore, avoid coadministration of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE with other anticholinergic-containing drugs as this may lead to an increase in anticholinergic adverse effects <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9, 5.10) and Adverse Reactions (6)].</span></p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with BREZTRI AEROSPHERE or with two of its individual components, glycopyrrolate or formoterol fumarate, in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk; however, studies are available for the other component, budesonide.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, budesonide alone, administered by the subcutaneous route, caused structural abnormalities, was embryocidal, and reduced fetal weights in rats and rabbits at 0.3 and 0.75 times maximum recommended human daily inhaled dose (MRHDID), respectively, but these effects were not seen in rats that received inhaled doses up to 4 times the MRHDID. Studies of pregnant women who received inhaled budesonide alone during pregnancy have not shown increased risk of abnormalities. Experience with oral corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroid exposure than humans.</p><p>Formoterol fumarate alone, administered by the oral route in rats and rabbits, caused structural abnormalities at 1500 and 61,000 times the MRHDID, respectively. Formoterol fumarate was also embryocidal, increased pup loss at birth and during lactation, and decreased pup weight in rats at 110 times the MRHDID. These adverse effects generally occurred at large multiples of the MRHDID when formoterol fumarate was administered by the oral route to achieve high systemic exposures. No structural abnormalities, embryocidal, or developmental effects were seen in rats that received inhalation doses up to 350 times the MRHDID.</p><p>Glycopyrrolate alone, administered by the subcutaneous route in rats and rabbits, did not cause structural abnormalities or affect fetal survival at exposures approximately 2700 and 5400 times from MRHDID, respectively. Glycopyrrolate had no effects on the physical, functional, and behavioral development of rat pups with exposures up to 2700 times the MRHDID.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Labor or Delivery:</span> There are no well-controlled human trials that have investigated the effects of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE on preterm labor or labor at term. Because of the potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine contractility, use of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.</p><p class="First">Studies of pregnant women have not shown that inhaled budesonide increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during pregnancy. The results from a large population-based prospective cohort epidemiological study reviewing data from three Swedish registries covering approximately 99% of the pregnancies from 1995-1997 (i.e., Swedish Medical Birth Registry; Registry of Congenital Malformations; Child Cardiology Registry) indicate no increased risk for congenital malformations from the use of inhaled budesonide during early pregnancy. Congenital malformations were studied in 2014 infants born to mothers reporting the use of inhaled budesonide for asthma in early pregnancy (usually 10-12 weeks after the last menstrual period), the period when most major organ malformations occur. The rate of recorded congenital malformations was similar compared to the general population rate (3.8% vs. 3.5%, respectively). In addition, after exposure to inhaled budesonide, the number of infants born with orofacial clefts was similar to the expected number in the normal population (4 children vs. 3.3, respectively).</p><p>These same data were utilized in a second study bringing the total to 2,534 infants whose mothers were exposed to inhaled budesonide. In this study, the rate of congenital malformations among infants whose mothers were exposed to inhaled budesonide during early pregnancy was not different from the rate for all newborn babies during the same period (3.6%).</p><p class="First">In a fertility and reproduction study male rats were subcutaneously dosed for 9 weeks and females for 2 weeks prior to pairing and throughout the mating period.

The mechanism of action described below for the individual components applies to BREZTRI AEROSPHERE. These drugs represent three different classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid, an anticholinergic, and a long-acting selective beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenoceptor agonist) that have different effects on clinical physiology and inflammatory indices of COPD.</p><p class="First">Budesonide is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. In standard in vitro and animal models, budesonide has approximately a 200-fold higher affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and a 1000-fold higher topical anti-inflammatory potency than cortisol (rat croton oil ear edema assay). As a measure of systemic activity, budesonide is 40 times more potent than cortisol when administered subcutaneously and 25 times more potent when administered orally in the rat thymus involution assay.</p><p>In glucocorticoid receptor affinity studies, the 22R epimer of budesonide was two times as active as the 22S epimer. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicated that the two forms of budesonide do not interconvert.</p><p>Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of COPD. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic-mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy.</p><p class="First">Glycopyrrolate is a long-acting antimuscarinic agent which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of the M3 receptor at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> as well as <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> studies, prevention of methylcholine and acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstrictive effects was dose-dependent and lasted more than 12 hours. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The bronchodilation following inhalation of glycopyrrolate is predominantly a site-specific effect.</p><p class="First">Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic agonist (beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist) with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that formoterol has more than 200-fold greater agonist activity at beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptors than at beta<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptors. The <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> binding selectivity to beta<span class="Sub">2</span>- over beta<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenoceptors is higher for formoterol than for albuterol (5 times), whereas salmeterol has a higher (3 times) beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-selectivity ratio than formoterol.</p><p>Although beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but they raise the possibility that even highly selective beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists may have cardiac effects.</p><p>The pharmacologic effects of beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol fumarate, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">A TQT study was not performed with BREZTRI AEROSPHERE as budesonide is not known to affect the QT interval. However, the potential for QTc interval prolongation with glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate was assessed in a double-blind, single-dose, placebo- and positive-controlled crossover trial in 69 healthy subjects. The largest mean (90% upper confidence bound) differences from placebo in baseline-corrected QTcI for 2 inhalations of glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate 9/4.8 mcg and glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate 72/19.2 mcg, were 3.1 (4.7) ms and 7.6 (9.2) ms, respectively, and excluded the clinically relevant threshold of 10 ms. A dose-dependent increase in heart rate was also observed. The largest mean (90% upper confidence bound) differences from placebo in baseline-corrected heart rate were 3.3 (4.9) beats/min and 7.6 (9.5) beats/min seen within 10 minutes of dosing with 2 inhalations of glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate 9/4.8 mcg and glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate 72/19.2 mcg, respectively.</p><p class="First">The effects of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE on cardiac rhythm in subjects with COPD was assessed using 24-hour Holter monitoring at Week 16 in a 52-week trial (Trial 1).</p><p>The Holter monitoring population in Trial 1 included 180 subjects on BREZTRI AEROSPHERE 320 mcg/18 mcg/9.6 mcg, 160 subjects on glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate [GFF MDI 18 mcg/9.6 mcg], and 183 subjects on budesonide/formoterol fumarate [BFF MDI 320 mcg/9.6 mcg]. No clinically meaningful effects on cardiac rhythm were observed.</p><p class="First">Effects of BREZTRI AEROSPHERE on the HPA axis were assessed by measurement of 24-hour serum cortisol at Baseline and Week 24 in subjects with COPD.
