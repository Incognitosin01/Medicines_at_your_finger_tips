</ul><h2>Ferric Subsulfate Aqueous Description</h2><p class="First">Ferric Subsulfate, Aqueous; 8gm single-use glass vials.</p><h2>CONTENTS</h2><p class="First">Ferric subsulfate 259mg/g [0.0638gm Fe <span class="Sup">3+</span>/<span class="Sub">ml</span>]. Preserved with benzalkonium chloride 0.005%. Povidone USP 23.2%. Glycerin USP 13.3%. Purified Water USP.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Ferric Subsulfate Aqueous</h2><p class="First">Ferric Subsulfate, Aqueous, is a stypic agent used for achieving local hemostasis. In punch biopsies of the full dermis, the time to achieve hemostasis is typically less than 20 seconds.<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">1</span></span> <span class="Bold">One method of applying ferric subsulfate solution for dermal use consists of the physician placing fingers at the opposite edge of the wound and stretching the skin. The wound is then wiped with gauze, the ferric subsulfate solution applied, and the tension maintained for approximately 15 seconds.</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">2</span></span></p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For External Use Only</span>. Should inadvertent eye contact occur, the eye(s) should be washed immediately with large amounts of water or normal saline, occasionally lifting the upper and lower lids until no evidence of solution remains (approximately 15-20 minutes).</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">As with all iron solutions applied to dermal surfaces denuded of epithelium or to mucous membranes topical application of Ferric Subsulfate Aqueous (ferric subsulfate) may result in hyperpigmentation (“tattooing”).<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">3,4</span></span> Microscopically, this hyperpigmentation may be observed as ferrugination of collagen fibers and fibrin.<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">5</span></span> In one study of uterine cervical tissue, ferric subsulfate solution penetrated denuded mucosa and produced coagulation necrosis to a maximum depth of 0.6mm.<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">6</span></span> In an in vitro study, ferric subsulfate solution produced a radiopacity with a density intermediate between that of water/tissue and calcium.<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">7</span></span></p><p>Should a re-biopsy of the same lesion be required, pathologists and other physicians involved in the care of the patient should be aware of the previous use of ferric subsulfate solution. Previous use of ferric subsulfate solution may result in a histologic artifact upon re-biopsy of heavy pigmentation, similar to hemosiderin, together with shrinkage and discoloration of collagen bundles<span class="Bold">.</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">8,9</span></span> Similarly, previous use of ferric subsulfate solution may result in a radiographic artifact.</p><h2>CAUTION</h2><p class="First">Federal law (USA) prohibits dispensing without a prescription.</p><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Keep tightly closed and protect from light. <span class="Bold">DO NOT</span> use if seal is broken. Store at room temperature 59°-86°F (15°-30° C).</p><h2>DISPOSAL</h2><p class="First">Opened containers with unused portions of product and applicator swabs containing residual product should be placed in a suitable, dry container for later disposal according to local hazardous waste practices. Waste containing Ferric Subsulfate Aqueous should not be subjected to any thermal process whether intended for destruction or recycling purposes.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><ul class="Disc">
