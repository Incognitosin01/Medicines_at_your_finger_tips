Hydroxocobalamin works by helping cells in the body convert cyanide to a form that can be removed from the body through urination.</p><p>Cyanokit is used in an emergency to treat cyanide poisoning. This type of poisoning can occur if you are exposed to smoke from a house or industrial fire, if you swallow or breathe in cyanide, or if you get cyanide on your skin.</p><p>Cyanokit may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>If possible before you receive Cyanokit, tell your caregivers if you have high blood pressure, heart disease, congestive heart failure, liver disease, or kidney disease (or if you are on dialysis).</p><p>Also tell your caregivers if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to hydroxocobalamin, Vitamin B12, or cyanocobalamin (Nascobal, Cobolin, Cyomin, and others).</p><p>In an emergency situation it may not be possible before you are treated to tell your caregivers about your health conditions or if you are pregnant or breast feeding.
