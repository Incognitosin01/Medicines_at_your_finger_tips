It may also be used to treat a condition known as ankylosing spondylitis.</p><p>Etanercept-szzs injection is also used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It is also used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in patients who may benefit from receiving phototherapy (ultraviolet light treatment) or other treatments.</p><p>Etanercept-szzs is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using etanercept-szzs</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For etanercept-szzs, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to etanercept-szzs or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of etanercept-szzs injection in children with <i>juvenile idiopathic arthritis</i> younger than 2 years of age and in children with <i>psoriasis</i> younger than 4 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of etanercept-szzs injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have infections, which may require caution in patients receiving etanercept-szzs.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking etanercept-szzs, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using etanercept-szzs with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of etanercept-szzs</h2><p>Etanercept-szzs is given as a shot under the skin of your thigh, stomach, or upper arm. Etanercept-szzs may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital. If you or your child are using etanercept-szzs at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you how to prepare and inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand exactly how to use the medicine.</p><p>Etanercept-szzs comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>If you use etanercept-szzs at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself or your child a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems.</p><p>Etanercept-szzs is available in 2 forms. You may use a <i>prefilled syringe</i> or a prefilled <i>Sensoready® pen</i>.</p><p>The needle cap on the <i>prefilled syringe</i> and the internal needle cover within the cap of the <i>Sensoready® pen</i> contain dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you or your child have a latex allergy before you start using etanercept-szzs.</p><p>To use:</p><ul>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using etanercept-szzs.</li>
<li>Remove the carton with the syringe or pen from the refrigerator and place it on a clean cloth.</li>
<li>Allow 15 to 30 minutes for the syringe or autoinjector to warm up to room temperature.</li>
<li>Do not remove the needle cover on the prefilled syringe or pen while allowing the medicine to reach room temperature. Remove this just before use. Do not shake the medicine.</li>
<li>Check the liquid in the syringe or pen. It should be clear and colorless to slightly yellow, and may have small white particles. If it is cloudy, discolored, or has large particles in it, do not use it.</li>
<li>Choose an injection site on your body (eg, thigh, lower abdomen, or stomach area). Clean the injection site with a fresh alcohol wipe and let it dry.</li>
<li>Remove the cap or needle cover when you are ready to inject.</li>
<li>Do not inject into skin areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, thick, scaly, has scars or stretch marks, or affected by psoriasis.</li>
<li>When using the Sensoready® Pen, the window in the pen turns green when the injection is complete. After removing the Sensoready® Pen, if the window has not turned green, or if it looks like the medicine is still injecting, it means you have not received a full dose. Call your doctor right away if this happens.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of etanercept-szzs will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of etanercept-szzs. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
