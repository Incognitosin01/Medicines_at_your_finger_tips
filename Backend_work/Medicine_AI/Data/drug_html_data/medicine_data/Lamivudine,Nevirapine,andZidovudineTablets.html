</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HEPATOTOXICITY: Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, particularly in the first 18 weeks, has been reported in patients treated with nevirapine, a component of Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets. In some cases, patients presented with non-specific prodromal signs or symptoms of hepatitis and progressed to hepatic failure. These events are often associated with rash. Female gender and higher CD4 <span class="Sup">+</span> cell counts at initiation of therapy place patients at increased risk; women with CD4 <span class="Sup">+</span> cell counts greater than 250 cells per mm <span class="Sup">3</span>, including pregnant women receiving nevirapine in combination with other antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, are at the greatest risk. However, hepatotoxicity associated with nevirapine use can occur in both genders, all CD4 <span class="Sup">+</span> cell counts and at any time during treatment. Hepatic failure has also been reported in patients without HIV taking nevirapine for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Use of nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated</span> <span class="Bold">[ <span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>]. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis, or with increased transaminases combined with rash or other systemic symptoms, must discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">SKIN REACTIONS: Severe, life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have occurred in patients treated with nevirapine. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction. Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions must discontinue Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets and seek medical evaluation immediately. Transaminase levels should be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. The 14-day lead-in period with nevirapine daily dosing has been observed to decrease the incidence of rash and must be followed</span> <span class="Bold">[ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">MONITORING FOR HEPATOTOXICITY AND SKIN REACTIONS:</span><span class="Bold">Patients must be monitored intensively during the first 18 weeks of therapy with Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets to detect potentially life-threatening hepatotoxicity or skin reactions.  Extra vigilance is warranted during the first 6 weeks of therapy, which is the period of greatest risk of these events.  Do not restart Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets following clinical hepatitis, or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms, or following severe skin rash or hypersensitivity reactions.

The optimal frequency of monitoring during this period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, would include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation, and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout lamivudine, zidovudine, and nevirapine tablets treatment [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5)</span>]. In some cases, hepatic injury has progressed despite discontinuation of treatment.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustment</h3><p class="First">Because Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets is a fixed-dose combination and cannot be adjusted, it is not recommended for:</p><ul>

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine, a component of lamivudine, nevirapine, and zidovudine. tablets. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups.</p><p>The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with nonspecific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests.</p><p>The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible</span> [ <span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span> <span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets. Do not restart Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4 <span class="Sup">+</span>cell counts. In general, during the first 6 weeks of treatment, women have a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%), and patients with higher CD4 <span class="Sup">+</span> cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with nevirapine. In a retrospective review, women with CD4 <span class="Sup">+</span> cell counts greater than 250 cells per mm <span class="Sup">3</span> had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4 <span class="Sup">+</span> cell counts less than 250 cells per mm <span class="Sup">3</span> (11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4 <span class="Sup">+</span> cell counts greater than 400 cells per mm <span class="Sup">3</span> (6% versus 1% for men with CD4 <span class="Sup">+</span> cell counts less than 400 cells per mm <span class="Sup">3</span>). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4 <span class="Sup">+</span> cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4 <span class="Sup">+</span> cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT.</p><p>In addition, serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure requiring transplantation in one instance) has been reported in HIV-1 uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. Use of nevirapine for occupational and non-occupational PEP is contraindicated [ <span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><p>Increased nevirapine trough concentrations have been observed in some patients with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, carefully monitor patients with either hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for evidence of drug-induced toxicity. Do not administer Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment [ <span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">Nevirapine, a component of Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets, has been associated with severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects.</p><p>Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets and seek medical evaluation immediately. Do not restart Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction.</p><p>If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, measure transaminases immediately. Permanently discontinue Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets in patients with rash-associated transaminase elevations [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><p>Therapy with nevirapine must be initiated with a 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg per m <span class="Sup">2</span> per day in pediatric patients), which has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash. Discontinue Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets if a patient experiences severe rash or any rash accompanied by constitutional findings. Do not increase Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets dose to a patient experiencing a mild to moderate rash without constitutional symptoms during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg per day (150 mg per m <span class="Sup">2</span> per day in pediatric patients) until the rash has resolved <span class="Italics">.</span> The total duration of the once-daily lead-in dosing period must not exceed 28 days at which point an alternative regimen should be sought [ <span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span>]. Patients must be monitored closely if isolated rash of any severity occurs. Delay in stopping Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets treatment after the onset of rash may result in a more serious reaction.</p><p>Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash with nevirapine.</p><p>In a clinical trial, concomitant prednisone use (40 mg per day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) was associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Therefore, use of prednisone to prevent nevirapine-associated rash is not recommended.</p><h3>Hematologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression</h3><p class="First">Zidovudine, a component of Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells per mm <span class="Sup">3</span> or hemoglobin less than 9.5 grams per dL <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span> . Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed.</p><h3>Myopathy</h3><p class="First">Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, a component of Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets, and therefore may occur with therapy with Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets.</p><h3>Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis</h3><p class="First">Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including lamivudine and zidovudine, components of Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets. A majority of these cases have been in women.  Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine) and RETROVIR (zidovudine). Treatment with Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).</p><h3>Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis:</span> Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine, a component of Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine). Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow‑up for at least several months after stopping treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has been reported in HIV–1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine).</span></p><h3>Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens in HIV-1/HCV Co-Infected Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine, components of Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets, should be closely monitored for treatment‑associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine) and RETROVIR (zidovudine). Discontinuation of Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin).</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets is not advised.</p><h3>Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Lipoatrophy</h3><p class="First">Treatment with zidovudine, a component of Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets, has been associated with loss of subcutaneous fat. The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy are related to cumulative exposure. This fat loss, which is most evident in the face, limbs, and buttocks, may be only partially reversible and improvement may take months to years after switching to a non-zidovudine-containing regimen. Patients should be regularly assessed for signs of lipoatrophy during therapy with zidovudine-containing products, and if feasible, therapy should be switched to an alternative regimen if there is suspicion of lipoatrophy.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">See Table 5 for listings of established and potential drug interactions [ <span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>Concomitant use of St. John's wort ( <span class="Italics">Hypericum perforatum</span>) or St. John's wort-containing products and nevirapine, a component of Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets, is not recommended. Co-administration of St. John’s wort with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine, is expected to substantially decrease NNRTI concentrations and may result in sub-optimal levels of nevirapine and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to nevirapine or to the class of NNRTIs.</p><h3>Resistance</h3><p class="First">Nevirapine, a component of Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets, must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when nevirapine is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with nevirapine should take into consideration the potential for cross resistance. When discontinuing an antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine, the long half-life of nevirapine should be taken into account; if antiretrovirals with shorter half-lives than nevirapine are stopped concurrently, low plasma concentrations of nevirapine alone may persist for a week or longer and virus resistance may subsequently develop [ <span class="Italics">see Microbiology (12.4)</span>].</p><h3>Immune Reconstitution Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and nevirapine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium avium</span> infection, cytomegalovirus, <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span> pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.</p><p>Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul>

Binding to plasma protein is low. Approximately 70% of an intravenous dose of lamivudine is recovered as unchanged drug in the urine. Metabolism of lamivudine is a minor route of elimination. In humans, the only known metabolite is the trans-sulfoxide metabolite (approximately 5% of an oral dose after 12 hours).</p><p><span class="Italics">Zidovudine:</span> Following oral administration, zidovudine is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed. Binding to plasma protein is low. Zidovudine is eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism. The major metabolite of zidovudine is GZDV. GZDV area under the curve (AUC) is about 3-fold greater than the zidovudine AUC. Urinary recovery of zidovudine and GZDV accounts for 14% and 74% of the dose following oral administration, respectively. A second metabolite, 3′-amino-3′-deoxythymidine (AMT), has been identified in plasma.

Absolute bioavailability in 12 healthy adults following single-dose administration was 93 ± 9% (mean ± SD) for a 50 mg tablet and 91 ± 8% for an oral solution. Peak plasma nevirapine concentrations of 2 ± 0.4 mcg per mL (7.5 micromolar) were attained by 4 hours following a single 200 mg dose. Following multiple doses, nevirapine peak concentrations appear to increase linearly in the dose range of 200 to 400 mg per day. Steady-state trough nevirapine concentrations of 4.5 ± 1.9 mcg per mL (17 ± 7 micromolar), (n=242) were attained at 400 mg per day. Nevirapine tablets and suspension have been shown to be comparably bioavailable and interchangeable at doses up to 200 mg. When nevirapine (200 mg) was administered to 24 healthy adults (12 female, 12 male), with either a high-fat breakfast (857 kcal, 50 g fat, 53% of calories from fat) or antacid (Maalox <span class="Sup">®</span> 30 mL), the extent of nevirapine absorption (AUC) was comparable to that observed under fasting conditions. In a separate trial in HIV-1 infected subjects (n=6), nevirapine steady-state systemic exposure (AUC <span class="Sub">t</span>) was not significantly altered by didanosine, which is formulated with an alkaline buffering agent. Nevirapine may be administered with or without food, antacid or didanosine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Nevirapine is highly lipophilic and is essentially nonionized at physiologic pH. Following intravenous administration to healthy adults, the apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) of nevirapine was 1.21 ± 0.09 L per kg, suggesting that nevirapine is widely distributed in humans. Nevirapine readily crosses the placenta and is also found in breast milk <span class="Italics">[</span><span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)]</span>. Nevirapine is about 60% bound to plasma proteins in the plasma concentration range of 1-10 mcg per mL. Nevirapine concentrations in human cerebrospinal fluid (n=6) were 45% (±5%) of the concentrations in plasma; this ratio is approximately equal to the fraction not bound to plasma protein.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism/Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vivo</span> trials in humans and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies with human liver microsomes have shown that nevirapine is extensively biotransformed via cytochrome P450 (oxidative) metabolism to several hydroxylated metabolites. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies with human liver microsomes suggest that oxidative metabolism of nevirapine is mediated primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes from the CYP3A and CYP2B6 families, although other isozymes may have a secondary role. In a mass balance/excretion trial in eight healthy male volunteers dosed to steady state with nevirapine 200 mg given twice daily followed by a single 50 mg dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-nevirapine, approximately 91.4 ± 10.5% of the radiolabeled dose was recovered, with urine (81.3 ± 11.1%) representing the primary route of excretion compared to feces (10.1 ± 1.5%). Greater than 80% of the radioactivity in urine was made up of glucuronide conjugates of hydroxylated metabolites. Thus cytochrome P450 metabolism, glucuronide conjugation, and urinary excretion of glucuronidated metabolites represent the primary route of nevirapine biotransformation and elimination in humans. Only a small fraction (less than 5%) of the radioactivity in urine (representing less than 3% of the total dose) was made up of parent compound; therefore, renal excretion plays a minor role in elimination of the parent compound.</p><p>Nevirapine is an inducer of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic enzymes 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine induces CYP3A and CYP2B6 by approximately 20-25%, as indicated by erythromycin breath test results and urine metabolites. Autoinduction of CYP3A and CYP2B6 mediated metabolism leads to an approximately 1.5- to 2-fold increase in the apparent oral clearance of nevirapine as treatment continues from a single dose to two-to-four weeks of dosing with 200-400 mg per day. Autoinduction also results in a corresponding decrease in the terminal phase half-life of nevirapine in plasma, from approximately 45 hours (single dose) to approximately 25-30 hours following multiple dosing with 200-400 mg per day.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effect of Food on Absorption of Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine</span>: Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets may be administered with or without food.</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Special Populations:</span> <span class="Italics">Renal Impairment: Lamivudine and Zidovudine</span><span class="Italics">:</span> The effect of renal impairment on the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine has not been evaluated (see the U.S. prescribing information for the individual lamivudine and zidovudine components).</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatic Impairment:</span> <span class="Italics">Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets:</span> Do not administered Lamivudine, Nevirapine, and Zidovudine Tablets to patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C, respectively) hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span> .</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics">Lamivudine and Zidovudine:</span> The effect of hepatic impairment on the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine has not been evaluated (see the U.S. prescribing information for the individual lamivudine and zidovudine components).</p><p><span class="Italics">Nevirapine</span>: In a steady-state trial comparing 46 subjects with mild (n=17; expansion of some portal areas; Ishak Score 1-2), moderate (n=20; expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal-to-portal and portal-to-central bridging; Ishak Score 3-4), or severe (n=9; marked bridging with occasional cirrhosis without decompensation indicating Child-Pugh A; Ishak Score 5-6) fibrosis as a measure of hepatic impairment, the multiple dose pharmacokinetic disposition of nevirapine and its five oxidative metabolites were not altered.

Genotypic analysis of isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from lamivudine-treated subjects showed that the resistance was due to a specific amino acid substitution in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase at codon 184 changing the methionine to either valine or isoleucine (M184V/I).</p><p><span class="Italics">Zidovudine:</span> HIV‑1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to zidovudine have been selected in cell culture and were also recovered from subjects treated with zidovudine. Genotypic analyses of the isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from zidovudine-treated subjects showed thymidine analogue mutation (TAM) substitutions HIV-1 RT (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y or F, QK219E/R/H/Q/N) that confer zidovudine resistance. In general, higher levels of resistance were associated with greater number of substitutions.

Genotypic analysis showed mutations in the HIV-1 RT gene encoding Y181C and/or V106A substitutions depending upon the virus strain and cell line employed. Time to emergence of nevirapine resistance in cell culture was not altered when selection included nevirapine in combination with several other NNRTIs.</p><p>Phenotypic and genotypic changes in HIV-1 isolates from treatment-naïve subjects receiving either nevirapine (n=24) or nevirapine and zidovudine (n=14) were monitored in Phase 1 and 2 trials ranging from 1 to12 weeks or longer. After 1 week of nevirapine monotherapy, isolates from 3/3 subjects had decreased susceptibility to nevirapine in cell culture. One or more of the RT mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions K103N, V106A, V108I, Y181C, Y188C, and G190A were detected in HIV-1 isolates from some subjects as early as 2 weeks after therapy initiation. By week eight of nevirapine monotherapy, 100% of the subjects tested (n=24) had HIV-1 isolates with a greater than 100-fold decrease in susceptibility to nevirapine in cell culture compared to baseline, and had one or more of the nevirapine-associated RT resistance substitutions. Nineteen of these subjects (80%) had isolates with Y181C substitutions regardless of dose.</p><p>Genotypic analysis of isolates from antiretroviral-naïve subjects experiencing virologic failure (n=71) receiving nevirapine once daily (n=25) or twice daily (n=46) in combination with lamivudine and stavudine (trial 2NN) for 48 weeks showed that isolates from 8/25 and 23/46 subjects, respectively, contained one or more of the following NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions: Y181C, K101E, G190A/S, K103N, V106A/M, V108I, Y188C/L, A98G, F227L, and M230L.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cross-Resistance:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Lamivudine and Zidovudine</span>: Cross‑resistance has been observed among NRTIs.

Nevirapine-resistant HIV-1 isolates were cross-resistant to the NNRTIs delavirdine, efavirenz and etravirine. The Y188N conferred 22- and 7-fold reductions in susceptibility to delavirdine and efavirenz, respectively, but showed no decrease in susceptibility to etravirine. Similarly, the Y181I substitution reduced susceptibility to delavirdine and etravirine 3-and 8-fold, respectively, but did not reduce susceptibility to efavirenz. However, nevirapine-resistant isolates were susceptible to the NRTIs ddI and ZDV.
