Athenex has initiated temporary importation of another manufacturer's Potassium Chloride Injection Concentrate 2 mEq/mL into the U.S. market. This product is manufactured and marketed in Italy by Industria Farmaceutica Galenica Senese S.r.l. (Galenica).</p><p>Given the scale of this shortage, FDA is coordinating with several firms to import Potassium Chloride Injection 2 mEq/mL. At this time, however, no other entity except Athenex Pharmaceutical Division, LLC is authorized by the FDA to import or distribute Galenica's Potassium Chloride Injection Concentrate 2 mEq/mL ampule. FDA has not approved Galenica's Potassium Chloride Injection Concentrate 2 mEq/mL ampule but does not object to its importation into the United States. You may be provided with additional letters for other imported products you receive. Please read each letter in its entirety because each letter may contain different, product-specific information.</p><p>Effective immediately, and during this temporary period, Athenex will offer the following presentation of Potassium Chloride Injection Concentrate:</p><p>It is important to note the following:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Each ampule contains potassium chloride 20 mEq/10 mL (2 mEq/mL). An image of the carton label is included in Table 1.</li>
<li>Follow standard aseptic technique and withdraw contents of the ampule with a 5-micron filter needle. Change the needle before diluting in a solution for intravenous infusion.</li>
<li>There is no barcode on the ampule or carton. Alternative procedures should be followed to assure that the correct drug product is being used.</li>

To avoid potassium poisoning, the infusion must be slow.</p><p>Administration should be guided through serial electrocardiograms; serum potassium levels are not indicative of potassium cell concentrations. It is good practice to monitor the fluid, electrolytes and acid-base balance during the infusion.</p><p>The medicinal product should be administered with caution in patients:</p><h2>INTERACTIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have recently taken any other medicinal product, including medicines obtained without a prescription.</span></p><p>The use of drugs such as potassium-sparing diuretics may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia, particularly in the presence of renal dysfunction. Therefore, in such cases serum potassium levels must be monitored closely.</p><p>The use of medicinal products such as ACE inhibitors that cause a decrease in aldosterone levels can lead to potassium retention. Therefore, serum potassium levels must be monitored closely.</p><h2>SPECIAL WARNINGS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">The solution must be clear, colourless and free from visible particles. Use immediately after opening the container. The container must be used for a single uninterrupted administration and no residue may be used afterwards.</span></p><h3>Pregnancy and breastfeeding</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.</span></p><p>There are no data on possible adverse effects of the medicinal product when administered during pregnancy or breastfeeding or concerning the reproductive capacity.</p><p>Therefore, the medicinal product must not be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless clearly necessary and only after assessing the risk/benefit ratio.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on ability to drive and use machines</span></p><p>The medicine does not affect the ability to drive or use machines.</p><h2>POSOLOGY AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">The medicine must not be injected as such. It is fatal if infused undiluted (see Precautions for use).</p><p>The medicinal product should be administered intravenously only after dilution in a 5% glucose or 0.9% sodium chloride solution (saline solution) or other compatible solutions (see end of this section).</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Shake well when preparing the dilution and before administration.</span></p><p>The dose depends on the patient's age, weight and clinical condition, taking into account that the ordinary daily potassium requirement is as follows</p><p><span class="Italics Underline">Adults</span>: 40-80 mEq per day. The total dose must not exceed 200 mEq per day.</p><p><span class="Italics Underline">Children</span>: 2-3 mEq/kg per day.</p><p><span class="Italics">The safety and efficacy parameters</span> of potassium chloride have not been determined in children.</p><p>The medicinal product must only be administered with an intact renal function and at a rate not exceeding 10 mEq potassium/hour.</p><p>Under urgent conditions (potassium values less than or equal to 2 mEq/l with electrocardiographic changes and muscular paralysis) do not exceed the infusion rate of 40 mEq/h, under electrocardiographic monitoring and do not exceed the dose of 400 mEq in 24 hours.</p><p>Too fast infusions can cause local pain and the infusion rate should be adjusted in relation to tolerance.</p><p><span class="Bold">Incompatibility with Galenica Senese Potassium chloride</span></p><p>Unless otherwise indicated, and with the exception of the solutions indicated below, it is not recommended to mix the potassium chloride solution with other medicinal products.</p><p><span class="Bold">Solutions to be used for the dilution of Galenica Senese potassium chloride</span></p><p>See Posology and method of administration.</p><p>Dilute the solution immediately after opening the container; the diluted solution must be used immediately. This must be clear, colourless and free from visible particles. The container must be used for a single uninterrupted administration and no residue may be used afterwards.</p><p>Shake well when preparing the dilution and before administration. Do not use the medicine if the solution is not clear, colourless or should it contain particles.</p><p>Take all usual precautions to maintain everything sterile before and during the intravenous infusion.</p><h2>OVERDOSE</h2><p class="First">In case of overdose, immediately stop the infusion of the potassium-containing solution and establish a corrective therapy to reduce the high plasma levels of potassium and to restore, if necessary, the acid-base balance (see Precautions for use).</p><p>In case of accidental ingestion/intake of an excessive dose of Galenica Senese Potassium Chloride, inform your doctor immediately or contact your nearest hospital.</p><p>Should you have any further questions or doubts on the use of Galenica Senese Potassium Chloride, contact your doctor or pharmacist.</p><h2>ADVERSE EFFECTS</h2><p class="First">Like all medicinal products, Potassium Chloride can cause adverse effects, although not everybody has these.</p><p>The adverse effects of Potassium Chloride are listed below.
