Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Apomorphine sublingual (Kynmobi) is placed under the tongue, where it will dissolve in about 3 minutes.</p><p>Do not chew or cut the sublingual film, and do not swallow it whole. Allow at least 2 hours to pass between doses. Do not take more than 5 doses per day.</p><p>Apomorphine injection (Apokyn) is injected under the skin. A healthcare provider will give your first dose and may teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself.</p><p><b>Do not inject apomorphine into a vein.</b></p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand all instructions.</p><p>Prepare an injection only when you are ready to give it. Do not use if the medicine looks cloudy, has changed colors, or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p>Measuring your apomorphine injection dose correctly is extremely important. The dose in an apomorphine injection pen is measured in milliliters (mL) marked on the pen. However, your prescribed dose may be in milligrams (mg). One milligram, or 1 mg, of apomorphine is equal to 0.1 mL marked on the injection pen.</p><p>Your healthcare provider will show you where on your body to inject apomorphine. Use a different place each time you give an injection. Do not inject into the same place two times in a row.</p><p>You may be given other medications to help prevent nausea and vomiting. <b>Use only the anti-nausea medicine prescribed by your doctor</b>. Some anti-nausea medicines can increase certain side effects of apomorphine, or can make your Parkinson's symptoms worse.</p><p>Your blood pressure will need to be checked often.</p><p><b>The medicine from an apomorphine injection pen can cause irritation if it gets in your eyes or on your skin.</b> If this happens, rinse with water.</p><p>Do not stop using apomorphine suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms such as fever and confusion. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine.</p><p>If you stop using apomorphine injection for 7 days or longer, ask your doctor before restarting the medication. You may need to restart with a lower dose.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>Keep each sublingual film in the foil pouch until you are ready to take the medicine.</p><p>Use a needle and syringe only once and then place them in a puncture-proof "sharps" container. Follow state or local laws about how to dispose of this container. Keep it out of the reach of children and pets.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Use the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using apomorphine?</h2><p>Some people using apomorphine have fallen asleep during normal daytime activities such as working, talking, eating, or driving. <b>Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medicine will affect you</b>. Dizziness or severe drowsiness can cause falls or other accidents.</p><p>Avoid getting up too fast from a sitting or lying position, or you may feel dizzy.</p><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> It can further lower your blood pressure and may increase certain side effects of apomorphine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Apomorphine side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives, itching; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
