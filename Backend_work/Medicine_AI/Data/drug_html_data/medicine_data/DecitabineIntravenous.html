It also treats certain types of anemia. Decitabine is an antineoplastic (cancer medicine).</p><p>Decitabine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using decitabine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For decitabine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to decitabine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of decitabine injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of decitabine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of decitabine than younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of decitabine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Infection—May decrease your body's ability to fight an infection.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of decitabine</h2><p>Medicines used to treat cancer are very strong and can have many side effects. Before receiving decitabine, make sure you understand all the risks and benefits. It is important for you to work closely with your doctor during your treatment.</p><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you decitabine in a medical facility. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. You may receive decitabine either as a 3-day or 5-day regimen.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using decitabine</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that decitabine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Receiving decitabine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. It may also cause birth defects if the father is using it when his sexual partner becomes pregnant. Female patients should use effective birth control during treatment with decitabine and for 6 months after the last dose. Male patients who have female partners should use effective birth control during treatment with decitabine and for at least 3 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving decitabine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Cancer medicines can cause nausea or vomiting in most people, sometimes even after receiving medicines to prevent it. Ask your doctor or nurse about other ways to control these side effects.</p><p>Decitabine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>If you plan to have children, talk with your doctor before receiving decitabine. Some men receiving decitabine have become infertile (unable to have children).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Decitabine side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
