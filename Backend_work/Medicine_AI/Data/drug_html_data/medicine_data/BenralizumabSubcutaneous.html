It is given to patients whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. It is also used in patients whose asthma has an eosinophilic phenotype.</p><p>Benralizumab helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and may improve your breathing. It also helps reduce blood eosinophils, which are a type of white blood cell that may contribute to your asthma.</p><p>Benralizumab is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using benralizumab</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For benralizumab, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to benralizumab or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of benralizumab injection in children younger than 12 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of benralizumab injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of benralizumab than younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of benralizumab. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Asthma attack or</li>
<li>Bronchospasm (breathing problem), acute—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Parasite or worm infection—Should be treated first before receiving benralizumab.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of benralizumab</h2><p>A doctor or other trained health professional will give you benralizumab. It is given as a shot under your skin, usually in the upper arm, stomach, or thighs once every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, then once every 8 weeks.</p><p>Benralizumab injection may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital or clinic. If you are using benralizumab at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you or your caregiver how to inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand exactly how to use this.</p><p>Benralizumab comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>If you use benralizumab at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections. Do not inject into scars, moles, or skin areas that are red, bruised, tender, hard, or not intact.</p><p>Benralizumab comes in two forms: a prefilled syringe (to be given by the doctor or other healthcare professional) and prefilled autoinjector or Fasenra® Pen™ (to be used by the patient or caregiver).</p><p>Allow 30 minutes for the prefilled autoinjector (Fasenra® Pen™) to warm up to room temperature. Do not warm it in any other way.</p><p>Use each Fasenra® Pen™ only one time. Do not save an open autoinjector.</p><p>Check the liquid in the Fasenra® Pen™. It should be clear and colorless or slightly yellow. Do not use benralizumab if it is cloudy or if there are particles in it. Do not use the pen if it looks damaged or broken.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of benralizumab will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of benralizumab. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
