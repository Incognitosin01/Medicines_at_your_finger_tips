Abatacept helps keep joint damage from getting worse after other medicines have been used and did not work well.</p><p>Abatacept injection is also used alone or together with methotrexate to treat moderate to severe active juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).</p><p>Abatacept injection is also used alone or together with other medicines to treat active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), which is a type of arthritis that causes pain and swelling in the joints along with patches of scaly skin on some areas of the body.</p><p>Abatacept is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using abatacept</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For abatacept, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to abatacept or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of abatacept injection in children with JIA. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 2 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of abatacept injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of abatacept than younger adults and are more likely to have cancer and serious infections, which may require caution in patients receiving abatacept injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

Abatacept is given as a shot under your skin or into a vein.</p><p>If abatacept is <i>given through a vein</i> in your arm, it must be injected by your doctor slowly and your IV tube will need to stay in place for 30 minutes. You will receive abatacept again at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after your first dose and then every 4 weeks after.</p><p>Abatacept may be also given as a <i>shot under your skin</i>. It may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital. If you or your child are using abatacept at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you how to prepare and inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand exactly how to use the medicine.</p><p>Abatacept comes with patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>If you use abatacept at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself or your child a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems.</p><p>Abatacept is available in 3 forms: a vial (glass container), a prefilled syringe, or a ClickJect™ autoinjector. The <i>prefilled syringe</i> and <i>ClickJect™ autoinjector</i> are the dosage forms you can use at home.</p><p>Check the liquid in the prefilled syringe or ClickJect™ autoinjector. It should be clear and colorless or slightly yellow. Do not use it if it is cloudy, discolored, or if you see particles in it. Do not use the prefilled syringe or ClickJect™ autoinjector if it looks cracked or broken.</p><p>Allow 30 minutes for the syringe to warm up to room temperature. Do not warm abatacept in any other way.</p><p>Do not remove the needle cover on the prefilled syringe or the autoinjector cap while allowing the medicine to reach room temperature.
