Perforated tympanic membrane is considered a contraindication to the use of any medication in the external ear canal.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Discontinue promptly if sensitization or irritation occurs.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Transient stinging or burning may be noted occasionally when the solution is first instilled into the acutely inflamed ear.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 3 years have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Stinging or burning may be noted occasionally; local irritation has occurred very rarely.</p><h2>Hydrocortisone and Acetic Acid Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Carefully remove all cerumen and debris to allow solution to contact infected surfaces directly. To promote continuous contact, insert a wick of cotton saturated with the solution into the ear canal; the wick may also be saturated after insertion. Instruct the patient to keep the wick in for at least 24 hours and to keep it moist by adding 3 to 5 drops of solution every 4 to 6 hours. The wick may be removed after 24 hours but the patient should continue to instill 5 drops of solution 3 or 4 times daily thereafter, for as long as indicated. In pediatric patients, 3 to 4 drops may be sufficient due to the smaller capacity of the ear canal.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED</h2><p class="First">Hydrocortisone and Acetic Acid Otic Solution USP, 1%/2% is available in a 10 mL measured-drop, safety-tip plastic bottle (NDC 45963-412-61).</p><p>Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p><p>Keep container tightly closed.</p><p>Manufactured by:<br/>
