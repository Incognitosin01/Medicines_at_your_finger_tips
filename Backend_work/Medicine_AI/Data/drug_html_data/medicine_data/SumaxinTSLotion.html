</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION:</span> Sodium sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide with antibacterial activity while sulfur acts as a keratolytic agent. Chemically sodium sulfacetamide is N-[(4-aminophenyl) sulfonyl] acetamide, monosodium salt, monohydrate. The structural formula is:<br/></p><p></p><p>Each mL of <span class="Bold">Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 9% and sulfur 4%) Wash</span> contains 90 mg of sodium sulfacetamide and 40 mg of sulfur in a formulation consisting of: aloe, butylated hydroxytoluene, cetyl alcohol, disodium oleamido MEA sulfosuccinate, edetate disodium, fragrance, glyceryl stearate/PEG-100 stearate, green tea, magnesium aluminum silicate, methylparaben, propylparaben, purified water, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, sodium thiosulfate, stearyl alcohol, xanthan gum.<br/>
<br/>
Each mL of <span class="Bold">Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 8% and sulfur 4%) TS</span> contains 80 mg of sodium sulfacetamide and 40 mg of sulfur in a formulation consisting of: aloe, butylated hydroxytoluene, cetyl alcohol, disodium oleamido MEA sulfosuccinate, edetate disodium, fragrance, glyceryl stearate, green tea, magnesium aluminum silicate, methylparaben, PEG-100 stearate, propylparaben, purified water, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, sodium thiosulfate, stearyl alcohol, xanthan gum.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</span> The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods-Fildes theory, which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth.<br/>
<br/>
While absorption through intact skin has not been determined, sodium sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine, largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours. The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown, but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of Propionibacterium acnes and the formation of free fatty acids.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS:</span><span class="Bold">Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 9% and sulfur 4%) Wash</span> and <span class="Bold">Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 8% and sulfur 4%) TS</span> are indicated for the topical control of acne vulgaris, acne rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS: Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 9% and sulfur 4%) Wash</span> and <span class="Bold">Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 8% and sulfur 4%) TS</span> are contraindicated for use by patients having known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, sulfur or any other component of this preparation. <span class="Bold">Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 9% and sulfur 4%) Wash</span> and <span class="Bold">Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 8% and sulfur 4%) TS</span> are not to be used by patients with kidney disease.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span> Although rare, sensitivity to sodium sulfacetamide may occur. Therefore, caution and careful supervision should be observed when prescribing this drug for patients who may be prone to hypersensitivity to topical sulfonamides. Systemic toxic reactions such as agranulocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, purpura hemorrhagica, drug fever, jaundice, and contact dermatitis indicate hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Particular caution should be employed if areas of denuded or abraded skin are involved.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.</span> Keep away from eyes. Keep out of reach of children. Keep container tightly closed.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> General – If irritation develops, use of the product should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Patients should be carefully observed for possible local irritation or sensitization during long-term therapy. The object of this therapy is to achieve desquamation without irritation, but sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur can cause reddening and scaling of the epidermis. These side effects are not unusual in the treatment of acne vulgaris, but patients should be cautioned about the possibility.<br/>
<br/></p><p class="First">Information for Patients – Avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, lips and mucous membranes. If accidental contact occurs, rinse with water. If excessive irritation develops, discontinue use and consult your physician.<br/></p><p class="First">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility – Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PREGNANCY:</span> Category C – Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with <span class="Bold">Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 9% and sulfur 4%) Wash</span> and <span class="Bold">Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 8% and sulfur 4%) TS</span>. It is also not known whether <span class="Bold">Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 9% and sulfur 4%) Wash</span> and <span class="Bold">Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 8% and sulfur 4%) TS</span> can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. <span class="Bold">Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 9% and sulfur 4%) Wash</span> and <span class="Bold">Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 8% and sulfur 4%) TS</span> should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NURSING MOTHERS:</span> It is not known whether sodium sulfacetamide is excreted in the human milk following topical use of <span class="Bold">Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 9% and sulfur 4%) Wash</span> and <span class="Bold">Sumaxin® (sodium sulfacetamide 8% and sulfur 4%) TS</span>. However, small amounts of orally administered sulfonamides have been reported to be eliminated in human milk.
