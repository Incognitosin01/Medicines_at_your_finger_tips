Organ rejection happens when the immune system treats the new organ as an invader and attacks it.</p><p>Imuran is used to prevent your body from rejecting a transplanted kidney. This medicine is also used to treat symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Imuran may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Imuran may cause a rare type of lymphoma (cancer) of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow that can be fatal.</b> This has occurred mainly in teenagers and young men with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not take  Imuran if you are allergic to Imuran.</p><p><b>You should not use Imuran to treat rheumatoid arthritis if you are pregnant.</b> This medicine can harm an unborn baby.

Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>When given for kidney transplant, Imuran is usually given right before or on the day of transplant.
