Patients should be warned not to use this product if they are now taking a prescription monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) (certain drugs for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions, or Parkinson's disease), or for 2 weeks after stopping the MAOI drug. If patients are uncertain whether a prescription drug contains an MAOI, they should be instructed to consult a health professional before taking such a product.</p><p><span class="Italics">Drug interactions:</span> MAO inhibitors may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of antihistamines and the overall effects of sympathomimetic agents.</p><p><span class="Italics">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility:</span> No long term animal studies have been performed with R-Tanna Tablets.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy:</span> Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C.
