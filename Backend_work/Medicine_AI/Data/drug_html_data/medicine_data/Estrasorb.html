Estradiol is a form of estrogen, a female sex hormone that regulates many processes in the body.</p><p>Estrasorb is used to after menopause to reduce moderate to severe hot flashes. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 to 55 years old. When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating (“hot flashes” or “hot flushes”). In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe.</p><p>Estrasorb may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Estrasorb if you have any of the following conditions: a history of heart attack, stroke, or blood clot, a bleeding or blood-clotting disorder, liver disease, abnormal vaginal bleeding, history of an allergic reaction to estradiol topical, or a hormone-related cancer such as breast or uterine cancer.</p><p><b>Do not use Estrasorb if you are pregnant.</b></p><p>Estradiol may increase your risk of developing a condition that may lead to uterine cancer. Call your doctor at once if you have any unusual vaginal bleeding while using Estrasorb.</p><p>Children should avoid coming into contact with skin areas where you have applied Estrasorb. <b>Topical estradiol is absorbed through the skin and can cause side effects in a child who comes into contact with Estrasorb or with skin where the medicine was applied.</b></p><p>Estradiol should not be used to prevent heart disease, stroke, or dementia, because this medicine may actually increase your risk of developing these conditions. Long-term use may also increase your risk of breast cancer or blood clot.</p><h2>Before this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Estrasorb if you have:</p><ul>
