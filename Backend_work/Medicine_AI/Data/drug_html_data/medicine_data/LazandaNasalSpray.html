</ul><h2>Lazanda Nasal Spray Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</p><p>Healthcare professionals who prescribe LAZANDA on an outpatient basis must enroll in the TIRF REMS Access program and comply with the requirements of the REMS to ensure safe use of LAZANDA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7)].<br/>
Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals.<br/>
It is important to minimize the number of strengths available to patients at any time to prevent confusion and possible overdose.<br/>
Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse.<br/>
Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with LAZANDA and adjust the dosage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)].<br/>
Instruct patients and caregivers to take steps to store LAZANDA securely and to properly dispose of unused LAZANDA as soon as no longer needed [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2, 5.6), Patient Counseling Information ( 17)].<br/>
LAZANDA is not bioequivalent with other fentanyl products. Do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from other fentanyl products. There are no conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5)].<br/>
LAZANDA is NOT a generic version of any other oral transmucosal fentanyl product [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5)].</p><h3>Initial Dosage</h3><p class="First">2.2 Initial Dosage</p><p>Initiate treatment with LAZANDA for all patients (including those switching from another fentanyl product) using ONE 100 mcg spray of LAZANDA (1 spray in one nostril).</p><p>Repeat Dosing</p><p>If adequate analgesia is obtained within 30 minutes of administration of the 100 mcg single spray, treat subsequent episodes of breakthrough pain with this dose.<br/>
If adequate analgesia is not achieved with the first 100 mcg dose, dose escalate in a step-wise manner over consecutive episodes of breakthrough pain until adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects is achieved.<br/>
Patients MUST wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough cancer pain with LAZANDA.</p><h3>Titration and Maintenance of Therapy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">2.3 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Titration</span></p><p>The objective of dose titration is to identify an effective and tolerable maintenance dose for ongoing management of breakthrough cancer pain episodes. The effective and tolerable dose of LAZANDA will be determined by dose titration in individual patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Titration steps:</span> If adequate analgesia is not achieved with the first 100 mcg dose, dose escalate in a step-wise manner over consecutive episodes of breakthrough pain until adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects is achieved.</p><p>Patients MUST wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough cancer pain with LAZANDA.</p><p>The titration steps should be:</p><p class="First">Using the 100 mcg dose, a total of four sprays, alternating one spray in right nostril, second spray in left nostril, third spray in right nostril, and fourth spray in left nostril</p><p>OR</p><p>Using the 400 mcg dose; one spray in one nostril</p><p>Patients should confirm the dose of LAZANDA that works for them with a second episode of breakthrough pain and review their experience with their physicians to determine if that dose is appropriate, or whether a further adjustment is warranted.</p><p>The safety and efficacy of doses higher than 800 mcg have not been evaluated in clinical studies. Avoid the use of a combination of dose strengths to treat an episode as this may cause confusion and dosing errors.</p><p></p><p>In order to minimize the risk of LAZANDA-related adverse reactions and to identify the appropriate dose, it is imperative that patients be supervised closely by health professionals during the titration process.</p><p><span class="Bold">Maintenance Therapy</span></p><p>Once an appropriate dose has been established, instruct patients to use that dose for each subsequent breakthrough cancer pain episode. Limit LAZANDA use to four or fewer doses per day.</p><p>Patients MUST wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough cancer pain with LAZANDA.</p><p>During any episode of breakthrough cancer pain, if there is inadequate pain relief after 30 minutes following LAZANDA dosing or if a separate episode of breakthrough cancer pain occurs before the next dose of LAZANDA is permitted (i.e. within 2 hours), the patients may use a rescue medication as directed by their healthcare provider.</p><h3>Dose Re-Adjustment</h3><p class="First">2.4 Dose Re-Adjustment</p><p>If the response (analgesia or adverse reactions) to the titrated LAZANDA dose markedly changes, an adjustment of dose may be necessary to ensure that an appropriate dose is maintained.</p><p>If more than four episodes of breakthrough pain are experienced per day, re-evaluate the dose of the long-acting opioid used for persistent underlying cancer pain. If the long-acting opioid or dose of long-acting opioid is changed, re-evaluate and re-titrate the LAZANDA dose as necessary to ensure the patient is on an appropriate dose.</p><p>Limit the use of LAZANDA to treat four or fewer episodes of breakthrough pain per day.</p><p>It is imperative that any dose re-titration is monitored carefully by a healthcare professional.</p><h3>Administration of LAZANDA</h3><p class="First">2.5 Administration of LAZANDA</p><p>Instruct patients on the proper use of LAZANDA.</p><p>Prime the device before use by spraying into the pouch (4 sprays in total). If the product has not been used for 5 days, re-prime by spraying once. For priming, follow the instructions provided [See Medication Guide].<br/>
Insert the nozzle of the LAZANDA bottle a short distance (about ½ inch or 1 cm) into the nose and point towards the bridge of the nose, tilting the bottle slightly.<br/>
Press down firmly on the finger grips until they hear a “click” and the number in the counting window advances by one.</p><p>Advise patients that the fine mist spray is not always felt on the nasal mucosal membrane and to rely on the audible click and the advancement of the dose counter to confirm a spray has been administered.</p><h3>Discontinuation of Therapy</h3><p class="First">2.6 Discontinuation of Therapy</p><p>For patients no longer requiring opioid therapy, consider discontinuing LAZANDA along with a gradual downward titration of other opioids to minimize possible withdrawal effects. In patients who continue to take their chronic opioid therapy for persistent pain but no longer require treatment for breakthrough pain, LAZANDA therapy can usually be discontinued immediately [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3)].</p><h3>Disposal of LAZANDA</h3><p class="First">2.7 Disposal of LAZANDA</p><p>Instruct patients and caregivers to properly dispose of all unused, partially used and used LAZANDA bottles. The remaining liquid in all bottles must be sprayed into the pouch, provided in the pack, for safe disposal as soon as possible.</p><p>Instruct the patient how to do this correctly. If there are any unwanted therapeutic sprays remaining in the bottle, instruct the patient to spray these into the pouch until the number “8” appears in the counting window and there are no more full therapeutic sprays obtainable from the bottle. After the counter has advanced to “8”, the patient should continue to push down on the finger grips a total of four times in order to expel any residual medicine from the bottle. After the 8 therapeutic sprays have been emitted, the patient will not hear a click and the counter will not advance beyond “8”; further sprays emitted will not be full sprays and should always be trapped in the pouch, not used therapeutically.</p><p>Instruct the patient and caregiver to seal the pouch and place both it and the empty bottle into the child-resistant storage container. Patients must wash their hands with soap and water immediately after handling the pouch. The patient must discard the child-resistant container containing the pouch and the bottle in the trash.</p><p>The patient or caregiver must continue to store the LAZANDA bottle in the specially provided child-resistant container and the pouch out of the reach of children until proper disposal, as described above, is possible.</p><p>Instruct the patient to dispose of the LAZANDA bottle and start a new one if it has been 60 days or more since they first used the bottle of LAZANDA.</p><p>In the event that caregivers or patients require additional assistance with the disposal of LAZANDA bottles, call the West Therapeutic Development, LLC toll-free number (1-844-452-9263).</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Nasal Spray, LAZANDA is formulated to deliver a spray of 100 mcL of solution containing 100 mcg, 300 mcg or 400 mcg fentanyl base.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">LAZANDA is contraindicated in:</p><p>· Opioid non-tolerant patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression and death could occur at any dose in opioid non-tolerant patients <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1); Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.1<span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p>· Acute or postoperative pain including headache/migraine and dental pain, or in the emergency department.</p><p>· Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.9<span class="Italics">)]</span></p><p>· Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.14<span class="Italics">)]</span></p><p>Known hypersensitivity to fentanyl or components of LAZANDA (e.g., anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span>6.2<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdosage ( 10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of LAZANDA, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of LAZANDA.</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of LAZANDA are essential [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1)]. Overestimating the LAZANDA dosage can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. The substitution of LAZANDA for any other fentanyl product may result in fatal overdose [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5)].</p><p>LAZANDA could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant.</p><p>Accidental ingestion of (or exposure to) even one dose of LAZANDA, especially by (in) children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)].</p><p>Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [ <span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (</span>2.4<span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><h3>Increased Risk of Overdose in Children Due to Accidental Ingestion or Exposure</h3><p class="First">Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested transmucosal immediate –release fentanyl products.</p><p>Patients and their caregivers must be informed that LAZANDA contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure.</p><p>Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17)].</p><p>Detailed instructions for the proper storage, administration, disposal, and important instructions for managing an overdose of LAZANDA are provided in the LAZANDA Medication Guide. Encourage patients to read this information in its entirety and give them an opportunity to have their questions answered.</p><h3>Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of LAZANDA with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of fentanyl and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.2<span class="Italics">)]</span>, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of LAZANDA is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in LAZANDA treated patients may increase fentanyl plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When using LAZANDA with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in LAZANDA treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of LAZANDA until stable drug effects are achieved <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span>2.3<span class="Italics">), Drug Interactions (</span>7<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p>Concomitant use of LAZANDA with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of an CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease fentanyl plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. When using LAZANDA with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span>2.6<span class="Italics">), Drug Interactions (</span>7<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First">Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of LAZANDA with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions ( 7)].</p><p>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when LAZANDA is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7), Patient Counseling Information ( 17)].</p><h3>Risk of Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to LAZANDA from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as LAZANDA and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis.</p><p>LAZANDA is NOT a generic version of other transmucosal immediate release fentanyl (TIRF) formulations. When dispensing, DO NOT substitute a LAZANDA prescription for any other TIRF formulation under any circumstances. Other TIRF formulations and LAZANDA are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of LAZANDA compared to other fentanyl products including other TIRF formulations that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of LAZANDA for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose.</p><p>There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of LAZANDA should always be ONE 100 mcg spray. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3)].</p><h3>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</h3><p class="First">LAZANDA contains fentanyl a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, LAZANDA exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].</span></p><p>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed LAZANDA. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.</p><p>Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing LAZANDA, and monitor all patients receiving LAZANDA for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as LAZANDA, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of LAZANDA along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing LAZANDA. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (</span>17<span class="Italics">)]</span>. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><h3>Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program</h3><p class="First">Because of the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>, LAZANDA is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g. hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of LAZANDA, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required.</p><p>Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are:</p><p>· Healthcare professionals who prescribe LAZANDA must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements.</p><p>· To receive LAZANDA, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement.</p><p>· Pharmacies that dispense LAZANDA must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the REMS requirements.</p><p>· Wholesalers and distributers that distribute LAZANDA must enroll in the program and distribute only to authorized pharmacies.</p><p>Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.tirfremsaccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483.</p><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Prolonged use of LAZANDA during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1), Patient Counseling Information ( 17)].</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</h3><p class="First">The use of LAZANDA in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease</span>: LAZANDA-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of LAZANDA <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.1<span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</span>: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.1<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p>Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating LAZANDA and when LAZANDA is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.1<span class="Italics">)]</span>. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome with Concomitant Use of Serotonergic Drugs</h3><p class="First">Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of fentanyl with serotonergic drugs. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAO inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span>7<span class="Italics">)]</span>. This may occur within the recommended dosage range.</p><p>Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue LAZANDA if serotonin syndrome is suspected.</p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><h3>Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First">LAZANDA may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions ( 7)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of LAZANDA. In patients with circulatory shock, LAZANDA may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of LAZANDA in patients with circulatory shock.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness</h3><p class="First">In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO <span class="Sub">2</span> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), LAZANDA may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO <span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with LAZANDA.</p><p>Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of LAZANDA in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First">LAZANDA is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>The fentanyl in LAZANDA may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</h3><p class="First">The fentanyl in LAZANDA may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during LAZANDA therapy.</p><h3>Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery</h3><p class="First">LAZANDA may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of LAZANDA and know how they will react to the medication.</p><h3>Cardiac Disease</h3><p class="First">Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use LAZANDA with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug product cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety of LAZANDA has been evaluated in a total of 523 opioid-tolerant patients with breakthrough cancer pain. The average duration of therapy in patients in the long-term study was 73 days, with 153 patients being treated for over 3 months. Patients continuing into the open-label extension period of the safety study have been treated for up to 26 months.</p><p>The clinical trials of LAZANDA were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain; all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone, or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse reaction data presented in Table 1 reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received LAZANDA for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of LAZANDA therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse events are included regardless of causality or severity. Table 1 lists adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration by maximum dose received. The ability to assign LAZANDA a dose-response relationship to these adverse events is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Adverse Reactions That Occurred During Titration at a Frequency of <span class="Bold">&gt;</span>5%</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">System Organ Class MedDRA preferred term, n (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">100 mcg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=483)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">200 mcg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=380)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">400 mcg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=301)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">800 mcg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=161)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Total</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=516)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal disorders</span></p><p class="First">Nausea</p><p class="First">19 (4)</p><p class="First">6 (2)</p><p class="First">6 (2)</p><p class="First">5 (3)</p><p class="First">35 (7)</p><p class="First">Vomiting</p><p class="First">14 (3)</p><p class="First">10 (3)</p><p class="First">9 (3)</p><p class="First">1 (1)</p><p class="First">33 (6)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nervous system disorders</span></p><p class="First">Dizziness</p><p class="First">14 (3)</p><p class="First">11 (3)</p><p class="First">6 (2)</p><p class="First">4 (2)</p><p class="First">31 (6)</p><p>Table 2 lists, by dose, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of ≥5% within the total population that occurred after a final titrated dose had been determined.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Adverse Reactions That Occurred During Maintenance Treatment at a Frequency of ≥5%</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">System Organ Class MedDRA preferred term, n (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">100 mcg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=61)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">200 mcg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=68)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">400 mcg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=109)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">800 mcg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=108)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Total</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=346)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal disorders</span></p><p class="First">Vomiting</p><p class="First">8 (13)</p><p class="First">5 (7)</p><p class="First">9 (8)</p><p class="First">12 (11)</p><p class="First">34 (10)</p><p class="First">Nausea</p><p class="First">4 (7)</p><p class="First">6 (9)</p><p class="First">4 (4)</p><p class="First">9 (8)</p><p class="First">23 (7)</p><p class="First">Constipation</p><p class="First">6 (10)</p><p class="First">1 (1)</p><p class="First">8 (7)</p><p class="First">5 (5)</p><p class="First">20 (6)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General disorders and administration site conditions</span></p><p class="First">Pyrexia</p><p class="First">3 (5)</p><p class="First">5 (7)</p><p class="First">8 (7)</p><p class="First">6 (6)</p><p class="First">22 (6)</p><p>The adverse reactions listed below represent those that occurred in ≥1% of patients from clinical trials while receiving LAZANDA.

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth.</p><p>Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Labor or Delivery</span></p><p>Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. LAZANDA is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including LAZANDA, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>In women treated acutely with intravenous or epidural fentanyl during labor, symptoms of neonatal respiratory or neurological depression were no more frequent than would be expected in infants of untreated mothers.</p><p>Transient neonatal muscular rigidity has been observed in infants whose mothers were treated with intravenous fentanyl.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Fentanyl has been shown to embryocidal in pregnant rats at doses of 30 mcg/kg intravenously (0.4 times the 800 mcg dose of LAZANDA on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and 160 mcg/kg subcutaneously (2 times the 800 mcg dose of LAZANDA based on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis). There was no evidence of teratogenicity reported.</p><p>No evidence of malformations or adverse effects on the fetus was reported in a published study in which pregnant rats were administered fentanyl continuously via subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps at doses of 10, 100, or 500 mcg/kg/day starting 2-weeks prior to breeding and throughout pregnancy. The high dose was approximately 6 times the human dose of 800 mcg LAZANDA per pain episode on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis and produced mean steady-state plasma levels that are 3 times higher than the mean C <span class="Sub">max</span> observed following administration of 800 mcg dose of LAZANDA in humans.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Fentanyl is present in breast milk. One published lactation study reports a relative infant dose of fentanyl of 0.024%. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of fentanyl on the breastfed infant and the effects of fentanyl on milk production.</p><p>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with LAZANDA.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Monitor infants exposed to LAZANDA through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span>6.2<span class="Italics">), Clinical Pharmacology (</span>12.2<span class="Italics">), Nonclinical Toxicology(</span>13.1<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of LAZANDA have not been established in patients below the age of 18 years.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 523 opioid tolerant cancer patients with breakthrough cancer pain in clinical studies of LAZANDA, 148 (28%) were aged 60 years and over. No clinically meaningful difference was noted in the safety profile of the group aged over 60 years versus that of younger patients in LAZANDA clinical trials.</p><p>Elderly patients have been shown to be more sensitive to the effects of fentanyl when administered intravenously compared with the younger population. Therefore, exercise caution when individually titrating LAZANDA in elderly patients to provide adequate efficacy while minimizing risk.</p><p>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of LAZANDA slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)].</p><p>Fentanyl is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h3>Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Insufficient information exists to make recommendations regarding the use of LAZANDA in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Fentanyl is metabolized primarily via the human CYP3A4 isoenzyme system and the inactive metabolite is mostly eliminated in urine. If the drug is used in these patients, it is to be used with caution because of the hepatic metabolism and renal excretion of fentanyl.</p><p>It is recommended that LAZANDA be titrated to clinical effect for all patients with special care taken in patients with severe renal or hepatic disease.</p><h3>Sex</h3><p class="First">Both male and female opioid-tolerant cancer patients were studied for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain. No clinically relevant sex differences were observed in adverse events.</p><h3>Patients with Allergic (Seasonal) Rhinitis</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of LAZANDA in individuals with known allergic (seasonal) rhinitis showed no clinically meaningful differences in rate or extent of exposure to fentanyl, or in local tolerability of LAZANDA when compared to Asymptomatic (Unchallenged) state. However, when treated for their rhinitis with oxymetazoline, LAZANDA absorption was compromised [see Pharmacokinetics ( 12.3)].</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">LAZANDA contains fentanyl, a Schedule II controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">LAZANDA contains fentanyl, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. LAZANDA can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6)].</p><p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p><p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</p><p>“Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Health care providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>LAZANDA, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p>Risks Specific to the Abuse of LAZANDA</p><p>LAZANDA is for intranasal transmucosal use only. Abuse of LAZANDA poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of LAZANDA with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p><p>Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1)].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span></p><p>Acute overdose with LAZANDA can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment of Overdose</span></p><p>In case of overdose, priorities are: the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to fentanyl overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to fentanyl overdose.</p><p>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of fentanyl in LAZANDA, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.</p><p>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p><h2>Lazanda Nasal Spray Description</h2><p>LAZANDA (fentanyl) nasal spray is a liquid formulation of fentanyl citrate, an opioid agonist, intended for intranasal transmucosal administration. The product consists of a practically clear to clear, colorless, aqueous solution of fentanyl citrate in a glass multidose container to which is attached a metered-dose nasal spray pump with a visual and audible spray counter. Each actuation is designed to deliver a spray of 100 mcL of solution containing 100 mcg, 300 mcg or 400 mcg fentanyl base, respectively. This enables doses of 100 mcg , 300 mcg or 400 mcg to be administered using a single spray into one nostril (1 spray) and 200 mcg, 600 mcg or 800 mcg to be administered using a single spray into both nostrils (2 sprays).</p><p><span class="Bold">Active ingredient</span>: Fentanyl citrate, USP is N-(l-phenethyl-4-piperidyl) propionanilide citrate (1:1). Fentanyl is a highly lipophilic compound (octanol-water partition coefficient at pH 7.4 is 816:1). Fentanyl citrate is sparingly soluble in water (1:40). The molecular weight of the free base and citrate salt are 336.5 and 528.6, respectively. The pKa is 8.4. The compound has the following structural formula:</p><p></p><p>LAZANDA is available in 3 strengths of nasal spray: 100 mcg fentanyl (yellow label), 300 mcg fentanyl (blue label) and 400 mcg fentanyl (violet label). The strength is expressed as the amount of fentanyl free base per spray, e.g., the 100 mcg strength provides 100 mcg of fentanyl free base per 100 mcL spray.</p><p><span class="Bold">Inactive ingredients</span>: mannitol, pectin, phenylethyl alcohol, propylparaben, sucrose, water. Sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid are added if required for pH adjustment.</p><h2>Lazanda Nasal Spray - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Fentanyl is an opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on the Central Nervous System</span></p><p>Fentanyl produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increase in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.</p><p>Fentanyl causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span></p><p>Fentanyl causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span></p><p>Fentanyl produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Endocrine System</span></p><p>Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2)]. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2)].</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Immune System</span></p><p>Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.</p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration–Efficacy Relationships</span></p><p>The analgesic effects of fentanyl are related to the blood level of the drug, if proper allowance is made for the delay into and out of the CNS (a process with a 3- to 5-minute half-life).</p><p>In general, the effective concentration and the concentration at which toxicity occurs increase with increasing tolerance with any and all opioids. The rate of development of tolerance varies widely among individuals.</p><p>The minimum effective analgesic concentration of fentanyl for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1, 2.4)].</p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration–Adverse Reaction Relationships</span></p><p>There is a relationship between increasing fentanyl plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)].</p><p><span class="Bold">Respiratory System</span></p><p>All opioid mu-receptor agonists, including fentanyl, produce dose-dependent respiratory depression. The risk of respiratory depression is less in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy who develop tolerance to respiratory depression and other opioid effects. Peak respiratory depressive effects may be seen as early as 15 to 30 minutes from the start of transmucosal fentanyl citrate product administration and may persist for several hours.</p><p>Serious or fatal respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses. Although not observed with oral or nasal transmucosal fentanyl products in clinical trials, fentanyl given rapidly by intravenous injection in large doses may interfere with respiration by causing rigidity in the muscles of respiration. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1), Adverse Reactions ( 6), Overdosage ( 10)].</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>In a study that compared the relative bioavailability of LAZANDA and an oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate product, the bioavailability of fentanyl from LAZANDA was approximately 20% higher.

Breakthrough cancer pain was defined as a transient flare of moderate-to-severe pain occurring in patients experiencing persistent cancer pain otherwise controlled with maintenance doses of opioid medications including at least 60 mg of oral morphine/day or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid (which could be fentanyl) for a week or longer. All patients were on stable doses of either long-acting oral opioids or transdermal fentanyl for their persistent cancer pain.</p><p>The clinical trial included an open-label titration phase where a dose was identified that provided adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects, within the range of 100 to 800 mcg.
