Therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved; if no improvement is seen, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Occlusive dressings may be used during treatment of psoriasis or recalcitrant conditions; discontinue use of occlusive dressings if infection develops. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Aldesleukin: Corticosteroids may diminish the antineoplastic effect of Aldesleukin. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Calcipotriene: Hydrocortisone (Topical) may diminish the therapeutic effect of Calcipotriene.  Management: Monitor for reduced calcipotriene efficacy if combined with hydrocortisone valerate. Consider separating the administration of these agents by 10 to 12 hours to minimize the risk of this potential interaction.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Adrenal suppression: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids may cause hypercortisolism or suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, particularly in younger children or in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods. HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis.</p><p>• Immunosuppression: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection; discontinue if dermatological infection persists despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy.</p><p>• Sensitization: Topical use has been associated with local sensitization (redness, irritation); discontinue if sensitization is noted.</p><p>• Systemic effects: Topical corticosteroids may be absorbed percutaneously. Absorption of topical corticosteroids may cause manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, or glycosuria. Absorption is increased by the use of occlusive dressings, application to denuded skin, or application to large surface areas.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Pediatric: Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of corticosteroids after topical application and may be more prone to systemic effects. HPA axis suppression, intracranial hypertension, and Cushing's syndrome have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Prolonged use may affect growth velocity; growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Sulfite: May contain sodium metabisulfate; use caution in patients with sulfite allergy.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
