Qutenza patches must be applied only by a healthcare professional.</p><p>Do not touch Qutenza, treatment areas, and all used supplies or other materials placed in contact with the treatment area without wearing nitrile gloves.</p><p>Do not take by mouth. This medicine is for use only on the skin.</p><p>Do not use Qutenza on open wounds or on sunburned, windburned, dry, chapped, or irritated skin. <b>If this medicine gets in your eyes, nose, mouth, rectum, or vagina, rinse with water.</b></p><p>Make sure your skin is clean and dry before you apply the patch.</p><p>Pre-treat the area with a topical anesthetic to reduce discomfort associated with the application of Qutenza.</p><p>Apply topical anesthetic to the entire treatment area and surrounding 1 to 2 cm, and keep the local anesthetic in place until the skin is anesthetized prior to the application of a Qutenza patch.</p><p>Qutenza patches must be applied only by a healthcare professional. Tear open the pouch along the three dashed lines and remove the patch.</p><p>Inspect the patch and identify the outer surface backing layer with the printing on one side and the capsaicin-containing adhesive on the other side. The adhesive side of the patch is covered by a clear, unprinted, diagonally-cut release liner.</p><p>Cut the patch before removing the protective release liner. The diagonal cut in the release liner is to aid in its removal. Peel a small section of the release liner back, and place the adhesive side of the patch on the treatment area.</p><p>While you slowly peel back the release liner from under the patch with one hand, use your other hand to smooth the patch down on to the skin.</p><p>Once the Qutenza patch is applied, leave in place for 60 minutes for postherpetic neuralgia, and 30 minutes for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the feet.</p><p>To keep the medication from getting on your hands when you apply it, use nitrile gloves. Wear nitrile gloves at all times while handling Qutenza and cleaning treatment areas.</p><p>Capsaicin can cause a burning sensation wherever it is applied.</p><p>If the burning sensation is painful or causes significant discomfort, wash the treated skin area with soap and cool water. <b>Get medical attention right away if you have severe burning, pain, swelling, or blistering.</b></p><p>Do not cover treated skin with a bandage or heating pad, which can increase the burning sensation. You may cover the skin with clothing.</p><p>Avoid taking a bath or shower within 1 hour before or after you apply capsaicin to your skin. Also avoid direct sunlight, swimming or vigorous exercise. Warm water or perspiration can increase the burning sensation caused by capsaicin.</p><p>Avoid getting Qutenza in your eyes or near your nose where you might inhale it. If it does get into any of these areas, rinse thoroughly with water.</p><p>Use only nitrile gloves when handling Qutenza, and when cleaning capsaicin residue from the skin. Do not use latex gloves as they do not provide adequate protection.</p><p>Also avoid getting this medication on contact lenses, dentures, and other items that come into contact with sensitive areas of your body.</p><p>For best results, keep using the medication as directed. Pain relief should occur gradually as the substance P in your body is decreased in the nerve cells.</p><p>Call your doctor if your pain does not improve after using this medication for 7 days, or if your symptoms get worse or get better and then come back in a few days.</p><p>Store Qutenza at room temperature away from moisture and heat, in a place where children and pets cannot get to it.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Postherpetic Neuralgia:</b></p><p>Up to 4 patches applied to intact, non-irritated, dry skin, and allowed to remain in place for 30 minutes for the feet and 60 minutes for other locations<br/>
