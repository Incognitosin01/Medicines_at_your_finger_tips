It is given to patients whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. It is also used to treat eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES).</p><p>Mepolizumab is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using mepolizumab</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For mepolizumab, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to mepolizumab or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of mepolizumab injection to treat severe asthma in children younger than 6 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of mepolizumab injection to treat EGPA in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of mepolizumab injection to treat HES in children younger than 12 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of mepolizumab injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving mepolizumab injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of mepolizumab. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Parasitic infections—Should be treated first before receiving mepolizumab.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of mepolizumab</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you or your child mepolizumab. It is given as a shot under your skin, usually on the upper arms, stomach, or thigh once every 4 weeks.</p><p>Mepolizumab injection may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital or clinic. If you are using mepolizumab at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you how to inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand exactly how to use this.</p><p>Mepolizumab comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow the instructions carefully . Ask your doctor if you have questions.</p><p>If you use mepolizumab at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems. Do not inject into scars, moles, or skin areas that are red, bruised, tender, hard, or not intact.</p><p>Mepolizumab is available in 2 forms. You may use a <i>prefilled syringe</i> or a <i>prefilled autoinjector</i>.</p><p>Allow the prefilled syringe or prefilled autoinjector to warm to room temperature 30 minutes before using it. Do not warm it in any other way.</p><p>Check the liquid in the prefilled syringe or prefilled autoinjector. It should be clear and colorless or slightly yellow. Do not use mepolizumab if it is cloudy or if there are particles in it. Do not use the prefilled syringe or autoinjector if it looks damaged or broken.</p><p>Use all of the medicine in each prefilled syringe or autoinjector. Use each prefilled syringe and autoinjector only one time. Do not save an open syringe or autoinjector.</p><p>Mepolizumab must be injected within 8 hours after removal from the carton. Throw away if not used within 8 hours.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of mepolizumab will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label.
