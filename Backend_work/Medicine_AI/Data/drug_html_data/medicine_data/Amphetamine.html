One advantage of Vyvanse is that it may be less likely to be abused; however, there is no generic form available so it is more costly than Adderall.

Studies have shown that Vyvanse is just as effective as Adderall, and side effects, including the risk of dependence, are similar.</p><p>  Continue reading</p><p>Adzenys ER is an extended-release 1.25mg/mL liquid suspension compared to most other brands of amphetamine which are tablet and capsule formulations.
