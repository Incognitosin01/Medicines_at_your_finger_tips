</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Doxercalciferol Injection</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>Doxercalciferol Injection is indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adult patients with CKD on dialysis.</li>
</ul><h2>Doxercalciferol Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Prior to Initiation of Doxercalciferol Injection</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Ensure serum calcium is not above the upper limit of normal before initiating treatment with Doxercalciferol Injection <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></li>
</ul><h3>Important Administration Instructions for Doxercalciferol Injection</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Administer Doxercalciferol Injection intravenously as a bolus dose at the end of dialysis.</li>
<li>Inspect Doxercalciferol Injection visually prior to administration; the solution should appear clear and colorless. Do not use if the solution is not clear or particles are present.</li>
<li>After initial vial use, store opened multi-dose vial for up to 3 days at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Discard unused portion of multi-dose vial after 3 days <span class="Italics">[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].</span></li>
</ul><h3>Dosage Recommendations for Doxercalciferol Injection in Patients with CKD on Dialysis</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Initiate Doxercalciferol Injection at a dose of 4 mcg given by bolus intravenous administration three times weekly at the end of dialysis (no more frequently than every other day).</li>
<li>Target the maintenance dose of doxercalciferol to intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels within the desired therapeutic range and serum calcium within normal limits.</li>
<li>Monitor serum calcium, phosphorus, and intact PTH levels weekly after initiation of therapy or dose adjustment.</li>
<li>Titrate the dose of Doxercalciferol Injection based on intact PTH. The dose may be increased at 8-week intervals by 1 mcg to 2 mcg if intact PTH is not lowered by 50% and fails to reach the target range. The maximum dose is 18 mcg weekly. Prior to raising the dose, ensure serum calcium is within normal limits.</li>
<li>Suspend or decrease the dose if intact PTH is persistently and abnormally low to reduce the risk of adynamic bone disease <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span> or if serum calcium is consistently above the normal range to reduce the risk of hypercalcemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span> If suspended, the drug should be restarted one week later at a dose that is at least 1 mcg lower.</li>
</ul><h3>Drug Interactions that May Require Dosage Adjustments of Doxercalciferol Injection</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Increased monitoring of serum calcium and dose adjustment of doxercalciferol may be necessary when given concomitantly with drugs that may increase the risk of hypercalcemia <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></li>
<li>Increased monitoring of both serum calcium and intact PTH as well as dose adjustment of doxercalciferol may be necessary when given concomitantly with cytochrome P450 inhibitors or enzyme inducers <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Injection: clear and colorless solution available as follows:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>4 mcg per 2 mL (2 mcg per mL) multi-dose vial</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Doxercalciferol is contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Hypercalcemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Vitamin D toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Known hypersensitivity to doxercalciferol or any of the inactive ingredients of Doxercalciferol Injection; serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypercalcemia</h3><p class="First">Hypercalcemia may occur during doxercalciferol treatment. Acute hypercalcemia may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the effect of digitalis on the heart <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Severe hypercalcemia may require emergency attention.</p><p>Hypercalcemia may be exacerbated by concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations, thiazide diuretics, or other vitamin D compounds <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span> In addition, high intake of calcium and phosphate concomitantly with vitamin D compounds may lead to hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia. Patients with a history of hypercalcemia prior to initiating therapy may be at increased risk for development of hypercalcemia with doxercalciferol. In these circumstances, frequent serum calcium monitoring and doxercalciferol dose adjustments may be required.</p><p>When initiating doxercalciferol or adjusting doxercalciferol dose, measure serum calcium frequently (weekly in patients with CKD on dialysis or every 2 weeks for patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD). Once a maintenance dose has been established, measure serum calcium monthly for 3 months and then every 3 months. If hypercalcemia occurs, reduce the dose or discontinue doxercalciferol until serum calcium is normal <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>.</p><p>Inform patients about the symptoms of elevated calcium (feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss) and instruct them to report new or worsening symptoms when they occur.</p><h3>Digitalis Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Doxercalciferol can cause hypercalcemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> which increases the risk of digitalis toxicity. In patients using doxercalciferol concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor both serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity. Increase the frequency of monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of doxercalciferol <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including fatal outcome, have been reported post marketing in patients on hemodialysis following administration of Doxercalciferol Injection. Hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylaxis with symptoms of angioedema (involving face, lips, tongue and airways), hypotension, unresponsiveness, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and cardiopulmonary arrest. These reactions may occur separately or together.</p><p>Monitor patients receiving doxercalciferol upon initiation of treatment for hypersensitivity reactions. Should a hypersensitivity reaction occur, discontinue doxercalciferol, monitor and treat if indicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Adynamic Bone Disease</h3><p class="First">Adynamic bone disease with subsequent increased risk of fractures may develop if intact PTH levels are suppressed by doxercalciferol to abnormally low levels. Monitor intact PTH levels to avoid oversuppression and adjust the doxercalciferol dose, if needed <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in another section of the label:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Hypercalcemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
<li>Adynamic Bone Disease <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Doxercalciferol Capsules</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adverse reactions in patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD</span></p><p>Doxercalciferol capsules have been evaluated in two placebo-controlled, double-blind 24 week studies in patients with Stage 3 or 4 CKD.

Adverse reactions occurring in the doxercalciferol capsules group at a frequency of 5% or greater and more frequently than in the placebo group are presented in Table 1.</p><p class="First Footnote">* Pooled data on adverse reactions from clinical study reports (Studies BCI-CH-115 and BCI-CH-119).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adverse reactions in patients with CKD on dialysis</span></p><p>Doxercalciferol capsules have been evaluated in two placebo-controlled, double-blind studies in patients with CKD on hemodialysis. Patients were treated with doxercalciferol capsules (n=61) or placebo (n=61) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>. After randomization to two groups, eligible patients underwent an 8-week washout period during which no vitamin D derivatives were administered to either group. Subsequently, all patients received doxercalciferol capsules in an open-label fashion for 16 weeks followed by a double-blind period of 8 weeks during which patients received either doxercalciferol capsules or placebo. Adverse reactions occurring in the doxercalciferol capsule groups at a frequency of 2% or greater, and more frequently than in the placebo group are presented in Table 2.</p><p class="First Footnote">* A patient who reported the same medical term more than once was counted only once for that medical term.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Doxercalciferol Injection</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adverse reactions in patients with CKD on hemodialysis</span></p><p>Doxercalciferol Injection has been studied in 70 patients with CKD on hemodialysis in two 12-week, open-label, single-arm, multicenter studies <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>. The incidence of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia increased during therapy with Doxercalciferol Injection. Patients with higher pretreatment serum levels of calcium (&gt;10.5 mg/dL) or phosphorus (&gt;6.9 mg/dL) were more likely to experience hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia.</p><p>There was no placebo group included in the studies of Doxercalciferol Injection. Adverse reactions in patients with CKD on hemodialysis receiving Doxercalciferol Injection are expected to be similar to those reported in placebo-controlled studies of doxercalciferol capsules presented in Table 2.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of doxercalciferol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Hypersensitivity reactions, including fatal outcome, have been reported in patients on hemodialysis following administration of Doxercalciferol Injection. Hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylaxis with symptoms of angioedema (involving face, lips, tongue and airways), hypotension, unresponsiveness, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cardiopulmonary arrest, pruritus, and skin burning sensation.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Tables 3 and 4 include clinically significant drug interactions with doxercalciferol.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>The limited available data with doxercalciferol in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.

Infants exposed to doxercalciferol through breast milk should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Considerations]</span>.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for doxercalciferol and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from doxercalciferol or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Infants exposed to Doxercalciferol Injection through breast milk should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, including seizures, vomiting, constipation and weight loss. Monitoring of serum calcium in the infant should be considered.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of doxercalciferol in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of doxercalciferol did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years or over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with hepatic impairment may not metabolize doxercalciferol appropriately. More frequent monitoring of intact PTH, calcium, and phosphorus levels should be done in patients with hepatic impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdosage of doxercalciferol may lead to hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. The treatment of acute overdosage should consist of supportive measures and discontinuation of doxercalciferol administration. Serum calcium levels should be measured until normal.</p><p>Based on similarities between doxercalciferol and its active metabolite, 1α,25-(OH)<span class="Sub">2</span>D<span class="Sub">2</span>, it is expected that doxercalciferol is not removed from the blood by dialysis.</p><h2>Doxercalciferol Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Doxercalciferol Injection contains doxercalciferol, which is a synthetic vitamin D<span class="Sub">2</span> analog. Doxercalciferol undergoes metabolic activation <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> to form 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<span class="Sub">2</span> (1α,25-(OH)<span class="Sub">2</span>D<span class="Sub">2</span>), a naturally occurring, biologically active form of vitamin D<span class="Sub">2</span>.</p><p>Doxercalciferol is a colorless crystalline compound with a calculated molecular weight of 412.65 and a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">28</span>H<span class="Sub">44</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>. It is soluble in oils and organic solvents, but is relatively insoluble in water. Chemically, doxercalciferol is (1α,3β,5Z,7E,22E)-9,10-secoergosta-5,7,10(19),22-tetraene-1,3-diol. The structural formula is:</p><p>Doxercalciferol Injection 2 mL multi-dose vials contain 4 mcg per 2 mL (2 mcg per mL) of doxercalciferol. Each milliliter (mL) of solution contains 2 mcg doxercalciferol and the following inactive ingredients: butylated hydroxytoluene, 20 mcg; edetate disodium, 1.1 mg; dehydrated alcohol, 59.25 mg; polysorbate 20, 10 mg; sodium chloride, 1.5 mg; disodium hydrogen phosphate, anhydrous, 7.63 mg; and monosodium phosphate monohydrate, 1.8 mg.</p><h2>Doxercalciferol Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Doxercalciferol is a synthetic vitamin D<span class="Sub">2</span> analog that requires metabolic activation to form the active 1α,25-(OH)<span class="Sub">2</span>D<span class="Sub">2</span> metabolite, which binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) to result in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways.

This increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be due to altered calcium homeostasis by doxercalciferol. No evidence of genetic toxicity was observed in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> bacterial mutagenicity assay (Ames test) or a mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay. Doxercalciferol caused structural chromatid and chromosome aberrations in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human lymphocyte clastogenicity assay with metabolic activation. However, doxercalciferol was negative in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus clastogenicity assay.</p><p>Doxercalciferol had no effect on male or female fertility in rats at oral doses up to 2.5 mcg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human oral dose of 60 mcg/week based on mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Clinical Studies of Doxercalciferol Capsules in Patients with Stage 3 or 4 CKD</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of doxercalciferol capsules were evaluated in two clinical studies in 55 patients with Stage 3 or 4 CKD. Eighty-two percent of the patients were male, the average age was 65 years, 51% were Caucasian, 40% African-American, and the average serum intact PTH level at baseline was 195 pg/mL. While levels of 25-(OH) vitamin D were not evaluated at baseline, retrospective assessments of stored serum revealed that the mean ± SD serum 25-(OH) vitamin D was 19 ± 8 ng/mL (range: &lt;5 to 54 ng/mL) in the study population.</p><p>After randomization to two groups, eligible patients underwent an 8-week washout period during which no vitamin D derivatives were administered to either group. Subsequently, one group received doxercalciferol capsules and the other placebo during the double-blind period of 24 weeks. The initial dose of doxercalciferol capsules was 1 mcg per day. The dosage of doxercalciferol capsules was adjusted as necessary by the investigator to reduce intact PTH levels to a target of ≥30% below postwashout baseline. The maximum dosage was limited to 3.5 mcg per day. If at any time during the trial intact PTH fell below 15 pg/mL, doxercalciferol capsules were immediately suspended and restarted at a lower dosage the following week.</p><p>Decreases in the mean plasma intact PTH from baseline values were calculated using as baseline the average of the last 2 values obtained during the 8-week washout phase. In analyses of pooled data from the two studies, intact PTH levels decreased from baseline by an average of 101 pg/mL in the doxercalciferol capsules group and by 4 pg/mL in the placebo group (p&lt;0.001). Twenty (74%) of 27 subjects in the doxercalciferol capsules group achieved mean plasma intact PTH suppression of ≥30% from baseline for the last four weeks of treatment, whereas two (7%) of the 28 subjects treated with placebo achieved this level of intact PTH suppression.</p><h3>Clinical Studies of Doxercalciferol Capsules in Patients with CKD on Dialysis</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of doxercalciferol capsules were evaluated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical studies (Study A and Study B) in a total of 138 patients with CKD on hemodialysis. Patients in Study A were an average age of 52 years (range: 22 to 75), were 55% male, and were 58% African-American, 31% Caucasian, and 11% Hispanic, and had been on hemodialysis for an average of 53 months. Patients in Study B were an average of 52 years (range: 27 to 75), were 45% male, and 99% African-American, and 1% Caucasian, and had been on hemodialysis for an average of 56 months. After randomization to two groups, eligible patients underwent an 8-week washout period during which no vitamin D derivatives were administered to either group. Subsequently, all patients received doxercalciferol capsules in an open-label fashion for 16 weeks followed by a double-blind period of 8 weeks during which patients received either doxercalciferol capsules or placebo. The initial dose of doxercalciferol capsules during the open-label phase was 10 mcg after each dialysis session (3 times weekly) for a total of 30 mcg per week. The dosage of doxercalciferol was adjusted as necessary by the investigator to achieve intact PTH levels within 150 pg/mL to 300 pg/mL. The maximum dosage was limited to 20 mcg after each dialysis session (60 mcg/week). If at any time during the trial intact PTH fell below 150 pg/mL, doxercalciferol was immediately suspended and restarted at a lower dosage the following week. Mean weekly doses during the 16-week open-label period ranged from 15 mcg to 29 mcg in Study A and from 19 mcg to 28 mcg in Study B.</p><p>One hundred and six (77%) of the 138 patients who were treated with doxercalciferol capsules during the 16-week open-label phase achieved intact PTH levels ≤300 pg/mL. Ninety-four (68%) of these patients exhibited plasma intact PTH levels ≤300 pg/mL on at least 3 occasions. Eighty-seven (63%) patients had plasma intact PTH levels &lt;150 pg/mL on at least one occasion during the open-label phase of study participation.</p><p>Decreases in plasma intact PTH from baseline values were calculated using as baseline the average of the last 3 values obtained during the 8-week washout phase and are displayed in Table 5.</p><p class="First Footnote">* All subjects; last value carried to discontinuation.</p><p class="First Footnote">NA = not applicable</p><p>Doxercalciferol capsules treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction from baseline in mean intact PTH levels during the 16-week open-label treatment period in more than 94% of the 138 treated patients.

Patients in Study C were an average age of 54 years (range: 23 to 73), were 50% male, and were 61% African-American, 25% Caucasian, and 14% Hispanic, and had been on hemodialysis for an average of 65 months. Patients in Study D were an average age of 51 years (range: 28 to 76), were 48% male, and 100% African-American and had been on hemodialysis for an average of 61 months. This group of 70 of the 138 patients who had been treated with doxercalciferol capsules in prior clinical studies (Study A and Study B) received Doxercalciferol Injection in an open-label fashion for 12 weeks following an 8-week washout (control) period. Dosing of Doxercalciferol Injection was initiated at the rate of 4 mcg administered at the end of each dialysis session (3 times weekly) for a total of 12 mcg per week. The dosage of doxercalciferol was adjusted to achieve intact PTH levels (measured weekly) within a targeted range of 150 pg/mL to 300 pg/mL. The dosage was increased by 2 mcg per dialysis session after 8 weeks of treatment if the intact PTH levels remained above 300 pg/mL and were greater than 50% of baseline levels. The maximum dosage was limited to 18 mcg per week. If at any time during the study intact PTH fell below 150 pg/mL, Doxercalciferol Injection was immediately suspended and restarted at a lower dosage the following week.
