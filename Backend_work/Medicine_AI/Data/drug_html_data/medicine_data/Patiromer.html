Patiromer also helps your body get rid of excess potassium through your stools (bowel movements).</p><p>Patiromer is used to treat hyperkalemia (high levels of potassium in your blood).</p><p>Patiromer works differently from other medicines because it passes through your stomach and into your intestines without being absorbed into your blood stream.</p><p>Patiromer may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Avoid taking other medicines by mouth within 3 hours before or 3 hours after you take patiromer.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>To make sure patiromer is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
