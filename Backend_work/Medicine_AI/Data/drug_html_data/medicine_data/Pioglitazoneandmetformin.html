<html><head></head><body><h1>Pioglitazone and metformin (Oral)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> metformin/pioglitazone (met-FOR-min hye-droe-KLOR-ide, pye-oh-GLI-ta-zone hye-droe-KLOR-ide)</p><p>May cause or worsen congestive heart failure, is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure, and is contraindicated in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure after initiation or dose increases and if heart failure occurs, consider dose reduction or discontinuing metformin/pioglitazone (immediate and extended-release formulations) and manage according to current standards of care. Lactic acidosis can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin/pioglitazone (immediate and extended-release formulations) and may result in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias; risk factors include renal impairment, concomitant carbonic anhydrase inhibitor use (eg, topiramate), age 65 years or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (eg, acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Onset is often subtle with nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain; laboratory abnormalities include elevated blood lactate (greater than 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without ketonuria or ketonemia), increased lactate:pyruvate ratio, and metformin levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL. If acidosis is suspected, discontinue treatment, hospitalize the patient immediately, and promptly initiate hemodialysis .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

Pioglitazone works by helping your body use insulin better. Metformin reduces the absorption of sugar from the stomach, reduces the release of stored sugar from the liver, and helps your body use sugar better. Pioglitazone and metformin does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Pioglitazone and metformin is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using pioglitazone and metformin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For pioglitazone and metformin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to pioglitazone and metformin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of pioglitazone and metformin combination in the pediatric population. Use is not recommended in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pioglitazone and metformin combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving pioglitazone and metformin combination.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking pioglitazone and metformin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using pioglitazone and metformin with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Your doctor may advise you to stop taking pioglitazone and metformin before you have major surgery or diagnostic tests, especially tests that use a contrast dye.</p><p>Under certain conditions, too much metformin can cause a serious condition called lactic acidosis. <i>The symptoms of lactic acidosis are severe and appear quickly</i>. Lactic acidosis usually occurs when other serious health problems are present, such as a heart attack or kidney failure. The symptoms of lactic acidosis include: abdominal or stomach discomfort, decreased appetite, diarrhea, fast or shallow breathing, a general feeling of discomfort, muscle pain or cramping, and unusual sleepiness, tiredness, or weakness. <i>If you have more than one of these symptoms together, you should get immediate emergency medical help</i>.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin.
