withdraw 10 ml of sterile water for injection. Inject the content of the syringe into the vial through the rubber stopper.<br/>
Remove the syringe and needle, and mix manually by repeated inversions.</p><p><br/>
The reconstituted solution is hypotonic and must be diluted in saline prior to administration. Reconstituted solutions, free of<br/>
visible particulate matter, may occasionally show opalescence; such solutions can still be used for further dilution.<br/>
If not used immediately after reconstitution, the product is stable for 8 hours when stored at 2°C to 8°C (36° to 46°F).</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Dilution in the infusion bag</span><br/>
Prior to administration, dilute the reconstituted solution further with an appropriate volume of sodium chloride 0.9% solution<br/>
for injection to obtain a final TEPADINA concentration between 0.5 and 1 mg/mL. Dilute TEPADINA as recommended in<br/>

<li>Patients with severe hypersensitivity to thiotepa <span class="Italics">[</span><span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>Concomitant use with live or attenuated vaccines <span class="Italics">[</span><span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myelosuppression</h3><p class="First">The consequence of treatment with high doses of TEPADINA together with other chemotherapy at the recommended dose and schedule in the preparative regimen for class 3 beta- thalassemia is profound myelosuppression occurring in all patients. Do not begin the preparative regimen if a stem cell donor is not available. Monitor complete blood counts, and provide supportive care for infections, anemia and thrombocytopenia until there is adequate hematopoietic recovery.</p><p>For patients receiving TEPADINA for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder, if the bone marrow has been compromised by prior irradiation or chemotherapy, or is recovering from chemotherapy, the risk of severe myelosuppression with TEPADINA may be increased. Perform periodic complete blood counts during the course of treatment with TEPADINA. Provide supportive care for infections, bleeding, and symptomatic anemia <span class="Italics">[</span><span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred following administration of TEPADINA. If anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, discontinue treatment with TEPADINA, initiate appropriate therapy, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">), Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>Cutaneous Toxicity</h3><p class="First">TEPADINA and/or its active metabolites may be excreted in part via skin patients receiving high-dose therapy. Treatment with TEPADINA may cause skin discoloration, pruritus, blistering, desquamation, and peeling that may be more severe in the groin, axillae, skin folds, in the neck area, and under dressings. Instruct patients to shower or bathe with water at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of TEPADINA. Change occlusive dressing and clean the covered skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of TEPADINA. Change bed sheets daily during treatment.</p><p>Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to TEPADINA may also occur. Wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water in case TEPADINA solution contacts the skin. Flush mucous membranes in case of TEPADINA contact with mucous membranes.</p><h3>Concomitant Use of Live and Attenuated Vaccines</h3><p class="First">Do not administer live or attenuated viral or bacterial vaccines to a patient treated with TEPADINA until the immunosuppressive effects have resolved.</p><h3>Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease</h3><p class="First">Hepatic veno-occlusive disease may occur in patients who have received high-dose TEPADINA in conjunction with busulfan and cyclophosphamide <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> Monitor by physical examination, serum transaminases and bilirubin daily through BMT Day +28, and provide supportive care to patients who develop hepatic veno-occlusive disease.</p><h3>Central Nervous System Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Fatal encephalopathy has occurred in patients treated with high doses of thiotepa. Other central nervous system toxicities, such as headache, apathy, psychomotor retardation, disorientation, confusion, amnesia, hallucinations, drowsiness, somnolence, seizures, coma, inappropriate behaviour and forgetfulness have been reported to occur in a dose-dependent manner during or shortly after administration of high-dose thiotepa. In pediatric patients treated with TEPADINA at the recommended dose in combination with busulfan and cyclophosphamide, 8% developed central nervous system toxicity (seizures and intracranial hemorrhage). Do not exceed the recommended dose of TEPADINA. If severe or life-threatening central nervous system toxicity occurs, discontinue administration of TEPADINA and provide supportive care.</p><h3>Carcinogenicity</h3><p class="First">Like many alkylating agents, thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicity (</span><span class="Italics">13.1)]</span>. Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice, but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man. There is an increased risk of a secondary malignancy with use of TEPADINA.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, TEPADINA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of TEPADINA in pregnant women. Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal (IP) route was teratogenic in mice at doses ≥ 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (0.8 mg/kg, 27 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>), based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>), approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area.</p><p>Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus [ <span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.1</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">8.3</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].

Thiotepa is unstable in acid medium.</p><h2>Tepadina Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Thiotepa is a cytotoxic agent of the polyfunctional type, related chemically and pharmacologically to the nitrogen mustard. The radiomimetic action of thiotepa is believed to occur through the release of ethyleneimine radicals which, like irradiation, disrupt the bonds of DNA. One of the principle bond disruptions is initiated by alkylation of guanine at the N-7 position, which severs the linkage between the purine base and the sugar and liberates alkylated guanines.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Thiotepa reached maximal concentrations close to the end infusion following an intravenous infusion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The binding of thiotepa to plasma proteins is approximately 10% to 20%.

The lowest reported carcinogenic dose in rats (0.7 mg/kg, 4.9 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>) is approximately 6-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area.</p><p>Thiotepa was mutagenic in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assays in <span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium, E coli</span>, Chinese hamster lung and human lymphocytes. Chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges were observed <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> with thiotepa in bean root tips, human lymphocytes, Chinese hamster lung, and monkey lymphocytes.</p><p>Mutations were observed with oral thiotepa in mouse at doses &gt; 2.5 mg/kg (8 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>). The mouse micronucleus test was positive with intraperitoneal administration of &gt; 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>). Other positive <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> chromosomal aberration or mutation assays included <span class="Italics">Drosophila melanogaster</span>, Chinese hamster marrow, murine marrow, monkey lymphocyte, and murine germ cell.</p><p>Thiotepa impaired fertility in male mice at oral or intraperitoneal doses ≥ 0.7 mg/kg (2.24 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>), approximately 12-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa (0.5 mg) inhibited implantation in female rats when instilled into the uterine cavity. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in mice at IP doses ≥ 0.5 mg/kg (1.6 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>), approximately 17-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in hamsters at an IP dose of 1 mg/kg (4.1 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>), approximately 7-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">TEPADINA was evaluated in a retrospective study of pediatric patients with class 3 beta-thalassemia who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation (HSCT) from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor. Twenty-five patients (10 male and 15 female) of median age 10 years (range, 5-16 years) were treated with intravenous busulfan at weight-based dosing from Day -10 to Day -7 pretransplant [ <span class="Italics">see Table 1</span>]), intravenous TEPADINA 5 mg/kg twice on Day -6, intravenous cyclophosphamide 40 mg/kg/day on Day -5 to Day -2, and marrow infusion on Day 0. All patients had also received precytoreduction with hydroxyurea, azathioprine and fludarabine prior to start of the preparative regimen.</p><p>Efficacy was based on the incidence of graft rejection (primary or late rejection). The incidence of graft rejection in these 25 patients using TEPADINA was 0% (95% CI: [0, 0.12]). Of the 51 patients who received the same preparative regimen, historically, without TEPADINA, the incidence of graft rejection reported was 25.5% (95% CI: [0.13, 0.37]).</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">1.
