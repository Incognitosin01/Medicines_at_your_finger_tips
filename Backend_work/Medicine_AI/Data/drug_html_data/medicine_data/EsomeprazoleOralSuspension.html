</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Esomeprazole magnesium for delayed release oral suspension, 10 mg - unit dose packet containing a fine yellow powder, consisting of white to pale brownish esomeprazole granules and pale yellow inactive granules.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Esomeprazole magnesium for delayed release oral suspension is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to substituted benzimidazoles or to any component of the formulation. Hypersensitivity reactions may include anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, and urticaria <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</p><p>For information about contraindications of antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated in combination with esomeprazole magnesium for delayed release oral suspension, refer to the CONTRAINDICATIONS section of their package inserts.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Presence of Gastric Malignancy</h3><p class="First">In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with esomeprazole magnesium does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.</p><h3>Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis</h3><p class="First">Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to nonspecific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea, anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia). Discontinue esomeprazole magnesium for delayed release oral suspension and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First">Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like esomeprazole magnesium may be associated with an increased risk of <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>-associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p>Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.</p><p><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents. For more information specific to antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated for use in combination with esomeprazole magnesium for delayed release oral suspension, refer to Warnings and Precautions section of the corresponding prescribing information.</p><h3>Bone Fracture</h3><p class="First">Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</h3><p class="First">Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including esomeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE.</p><p>The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.</p><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.</p><p>Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving esomeprazole magnesium, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.</p><h3>Interaction with Clopidogrel</h3><p class="First">Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole magnesium for delayed release oral suspension with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as esomeprazole, that inhibit CYP2C19 activity. Concomitant use of clopidogrel with 40 mg esomeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel. When using esomeprazole magnesium for delayed release oral suspension consider alternative anti-platelet therapy <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency</h3><p class="First">Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) caused by hypo-or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed.</p><h3>Hypomagnesemia</h3><p class="First">Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.</p><p>For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Interaction with St. John’s Wort or Rifampin</h3><p class="First">Drugs which induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (such as St. John's Wort or rifampin) can substantially decrease esomeprazole concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>. Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole magnesium for delayed release oral suspension with St. John's Wort or rifampin.</p><h3>Interactions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors</h3><p class="First">Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop esomeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Interaction with Methotrexate</h3><p class="First">Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.7)]</span>.</p><h3>Fundic Gland Polyps</h3><p class="First">PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The safety of esomeprazole magnesium was evaluated in over 15,000 patients (aged 18 to 84 years) in clinical trials worldwide including over 8,500 patients in the United States and over 6,500 patients in Europe and Canada. Over 2,900 patients were treated in long-term studies for up to 6-12 months. In general, esomeprazole magnesium was well tolerated in both short and long-term clinical trials.</p><p>The safety in the treatment of healing of erosive esophagitis was assessed in four randomized comparative clinical trials, which included 1,240 patients on esomeprazole magnesium 20 mg, 2,434 patients on esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg, and 3,008 patients on omeprazole 20 mg daily. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions (≥1%) in all three groups were headache (5.5, 5, and 3.8, respectively) and diarrhea (no difference among the three groups). Nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation, and dry mouth occurred at similar rates among patients taking esomeprazole magnesium or omeprazole.</p><p>Additional adverse reactions that were reported as possibly or probably related to esomeprazole magnesium with an incidence &lt;1% are listed below by body system:</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole:</span> abdomen enlarged, allergic reaction, asthenia, back pain, chest pain, substernal chest pain, facial edema, peripheral edema, hot flushes, fatigue, fever, flu-like disorder, generalized edema, leg edema, malaise, pain, rigors;</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> flushing, hypertension, tachycardia;</p><p><span class="Italics">Endocrine:</span> goiter;</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> bowel irregularity, constipation aggravated, dyspepsia, dysphagia, dysplasia GI, epigastric pain, eructation, esophageal disorder, frequent stools, gastroenteritis, GI hemorrhage, GI symptoms not otherwise specified, hiccup, melena, mouth disorder, pharynx disorder, rectal disorder, serum gastrin increased, tongue disorder, tongue edema, ulcerative stomatitis, vomiting;</p><p><span class="Italics">Hearing:</span> earache, tinnitus;</p><p><span class="Italics">Hematologic:</span> anemia, anemia hypochromic, cervical lymphadenopathy, epistaxis, leukocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia;</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic:</span> bilirubinemia, hepatic function abnormal, SGOT increased, SGPT increased;</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolic/Nutritional:</span> glycosuria, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, increased alkaline phosphatase, thirst, vitamin B12 deficiency, weight increase, weight decrease;</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> arthralgia, arthritis aggravated, arthropathy, cramps, fibromyalgia syndrome, hernia, polymyalgia rheumatica;</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System/Psychiatric:</span> anorexia, apathy, appetite increased, confusion, depression aggravated, dizziness, hypertonia, nervousness, hypoesthesia, impotence, insomnia, migraine, migraine aggravated, paresthesia, sleep disorder, somnolence, tremor, vertigo, visual field defect;</p><p><span class="Italics">Reproductive:</span> dysmenorrhea, menstrual disorder, vaginitis;</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory:</span> asthma aggravated, coughing, dyspnea, larynx edema, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis;</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Appendages:</span> acne, angioedema, dermatitis, pruritus, pruritus ani, rash, rash erythematous, rash maculo-papular, skin inflammation, sweating increased, urticaria;</p><p><span class="Italics">Special Senses:</span> otitis media, parosmia, taste loss, taste perversion;</p><p><span class="Italics">Urogenital:</span> abnormal urine, albuminuria, cystitis, dysuria, fungal infection, hematuria, micturition frequency, moniliasis, genital moniliasis, polyuria;</p><p><span class="Italics">Visual:</span> conjunctivitis, vision abnormal.</p><p>The following potentially clinically significant laboratory changes in clinical trials, irrespective of relationship to esomeprazole magnesium, were reported in ≤1% of patients: increased creatinine, uric acid, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, serum gastrin, potassium, sodium, thyroxine and thyroid stimulating hormone <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]</span>.

In 149 pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years the most frequently reported (at least 2%) treatment-related adverse reactions in these patients were headache (8.1%), abdominal pain (2.7%), diarrhea (2%), and nausea (2%).</p><p>The safety of esomeprazole magnesium was evaluated in 167 pediatric patients from birth to &lt;1 year of age in three clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>. In a study that included 26 pediatric patients aged birth to 1 month there were no treatment related adverse reactions. In a study that included 43 pediatric patients age 1 to 11 months, inclusive the most frequently reported (at least 5%) adverse reactions, irrespective of causality, were irritability and vomiting. In a study that included 98 pediatric patients, age 1 to 11 months, inclusive exposed to esomeprazole for up to 6 weeks (including 39 patients randomized to the withdrawal phase), there were 4 treatment-related adverse reactions: abdominal pain (1%), regurgitation (1%), tachypnea (1%), and increased ALT (1%).</p><p>No new safety concerns were identified in pediatric patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Combination Treatment with Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin</span></p><p>In clinical trials using combination therapy with esomeprazole magnesium plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin, no additional adverse reactions specific to these drug combinations were observed. Adverse reactions that occurred were limited to those observed when using esomeprazole magnesium, amoxicillin, or clarithromycin alone.</p><p>The most frequently reported drug-related adverse reactions for patients who received triple therapy for 10 days were diarrhea (9.2%), taste perversion (6.6%), and abdominal pain (3.7%). No treatment-emergent adverse reactions were observed at higher rates with triple therapy than were observed with esomeprazole magnesium alone.</p><p>For more information on adverse reactions with amoxicillin or clarithromycin, refer to their package inserts, Adverse Reactions sections.</p><p>In clinical trials using combination therapy with esomeprazole magnesium plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin, no additional increased laboratory abnormalities particular to these drug combinations were observed.</p><p>For more information on laboratory changes with amoxicillin or clarithromycin, refer to their package inserts, Adverse Reactions section.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of esomeprazole magnesium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reports are listed below by body system:</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood and Lymphatic:</span> agranulocytosis, pancytopenia;</p><p><span class="Italics">Eye:</span> blurred vision;</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> pancreatitis; stomatitis; microscopic colitis; fundic gland polyps;</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatobiliary:</span> hepatic failure, hepatitis with or without jaundice;</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune System:</span> anaphylactic reaction/shock; systemic lupus erythematosus;</p><p><span class="Italics">Infections and Infestations:</span> GI candidiasis; <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>-associated diarrhea;</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and nutritional disorders:</span> hypomagnesemia, with or without hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia;</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue:</span> muscular weakness, myalgia, bone fracture;</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System:</span> hepatic encephalopathy, taste disturbance;</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric:</span> aggression, agitation, depression, hallucination;</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal and Urinary:</span> interstitial nephritis;</p><p><span class="Italics">Reproductive System and Breast:</span> gynecomastia;</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal:</span> bronchospasm;</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue:</span> alopecia, erythema multiforme, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (some fatal), cutaneous lupus erythematosus.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Interference with Antiretroviral Therapy</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of atazanavir and nelfinavir with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. Co-administration of atazanavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and the development of drug resistance. Co-administration of saquinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to increase saquinavir concentrations, which may increase toxicity and require dose reduction.</p><p>Omeprazole, of which esomeprazole is an enantiomer, has been reported to interact with some antiretroviral drugs. The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known. Increased gastric pH during omeprazole treatment may change the absorption of the antiretroviral drug. Other possible interaction mechanisms are via CYP2C19.</p><p><span class="Italics">Reduced concentrations of atazanavir and nelfinavir</span></p><p>For some antiretroviral drugs, such as atazanavir and nelfinavir, decreased serum levels have been reported when given together with omeprazole. Following multiple doses of nelfinavir (1250 mg, twice daily) and omeprazole (40 mg daily), AUC was decreased by 36% and 92%, C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 37% and 89% and C<span class="Sub">min</span> by 39% and 75% respectively for nelfinavir and M8. Following multiple doses of atazanavir (400 mg, daily) and omeprazole (40 mg, daily, 2 hours before atazanavir), AUC was decreased by 94%, C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 96%, and C<span class="Sub">min</span> by 95%. Concomitant administration with omeprazole and drugs such as atazanavir and nelfinavir is therefore not recommended.</p><p><span class="Italics">Increased concentrations of saquinavir</span></p><p>For other antiretroviral drugs, such as saquinavir, elevated serum levels have been reported, with an increase in AUC by 82%, in C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 75%, and in C<span class="Sub">min</span> by 106%, following multiple dosing of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg) twice daily for 15 days with omeprazole 40 mg daily co-administered days 11 to 15. Therefore, clinical and laboratory monitoring for saquinavir toxicity is recommended during concurrent use with esomeprazole magnesium for delayed release oral suspension. Dose reduction of saquinavir should be considered from the safety perspective for individual patients.</p><p>There are also some antiretroviral drugs of which unchanged serum levels have been reported when given with omeprazole.</p><h3>Drugs for Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability</h3><p class="First">Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, esomeprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability. Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can decrease, while the absorption of drugs such as digoxin can increase during treatment with esomeprazole. Esomeprazole is an enantiomer of omeprazole. Concomitant treatment with omeprazole (20 mg daily) and digoxin in healthy subjects increased the bioavailability of digoxin by 10% (30% in two subjects). Co-administration of digoxin with esomeprazole magnesium is expected to increase the systemic exposure of digoxin. Therefore, patients may need to be monitored when digoxin is taken concomitantly with esomeprazole magnesium for delayed release oral suspension.</p><p>Co-administration of omeprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving esomeprazole magnesium and MMF. Use esomeprazole magnesium for delayed release oral suspension with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Effects on Hepatic Metabolism/Cytochrome P-450 Pathways</h3><p class="First">Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> studies have shown that esomeprazole is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that esomeprazole does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin, or amoxicillin.</p><p>However, postmarketing reports of changes in prothrombin measures have been received among patients on concomitant warfarin and esomeprazole therapy. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time.</p><p>Esomeprazole may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major esomeprazole metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of esomeprazole 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate, resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam.</p><p>Clopidogrel</p><p>Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of esomeprazole 40 mg results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition. Avoid concomitant administration of esomeprazole magnesium for delayed release oral suspension with clopidogrel. When using esomeprazole magnesium for delayed release oral suspension, consider use of alternative anti-platelet therapy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Omeprazole acts as an inhibitor of CYP2C19. Omeprazole, given in doses of 40 mg daily for one week to 20 healthy subjects in cross-over study, increased C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of cilostazol by 18% and 26% respectively. C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of one of its active metabolites, 3,4-dihydrocilostazol, which has 4-7 times the activity of cilostazol, were increased by 29% and 69%, respectively. Co-administration of cilostazol with esomeprazole is expected to increase concentrations of cilostazol and its above mentioned active metabolite. Therefore, a dose reduction of cilostazol from 100 mg twice daily to 50 mg twice daily should be considered.</p><p>Concomitant administration of esomeprazole and a combined inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, such as voriconazole, may result in more than doubling of the esomeprazole exposure. Dose adjustment of esomeprazole is not normally required. However, in patients with Zollinger-Ellison's Syndrome, who may require higher doses up to 240 mg/day, dose adjustment may be considered.</p><p>Drugs known to induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 or both (such as rifampin) may lead to decreased esomeprazole serum levels. Omeprazole, of which esomeprazole is an enantiomer, has been reported to interact with St. John's Wort, an inducer of CYP3A4. In a cross-over study in 12 healthy male subjects, St. John's Wort (300 mg three times daily for 14 days) significantly decreased the systemic exposure of omeprazole in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC decreased by 37.5% and 37.9%, respectively) and extensive metabolisers (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC decreased by 49.6 % and 43.9%, respectively).

Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole, which is a mixture of the S-and R-isomers. Its molecular formula is (C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">18</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>S)<span class="Sub">2</span>Mg x 2 H<span class="Sub">2</span>O with molecular weight of 749.15 as a dihydrate and 690.80 on an anhydrous basis.

The inactive granules are composed of the following ingredients: anhydrous citric acid, crospovidone, dextrose anhydrous, ferric oxide yellow, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose E-15, magnesium stearate, methyl acrylic acid and ethyl acrylate copolymer dispersion, plasACRYL<span class="Sup">®</span> HTP-20, polysorbate 80, purified water, sugar sphere, talc and xanthan gum. The plasticizer plasACRYL<span class="Sup">®</span> HTP-20 have the following inactive ingredients: glyceryl monostearate, polysorbate 80, triethyl Citrate. The esomeprazole granules and inactive granules are constituted with water to form a suspension and are given by oral, nasogastric, or gastric administration.</p><h2>Esomeprazole Oral Suspension - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H<span class="Sup">+</span>/K<span class="Sup">+</span>-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. The S-and R-isomers of omeprazole are protonated and converted in the acidic compartment of the parietal cell forming the active inhibitor, the achiral sulphenamide. By acting specifically on the proton pump, esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity. This effect is dose-related up to a daily dose of 20 to 40 mg and leads to inhibition of gastric acid secretion.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Antisecretory Activity</span></p><p>The effect of esomeprazole magnesium on intragastric pH was determined in patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease in two separate studies.

The mean fasting gastrin level increased in a dose-related manner. This increase reached a plateau within two to three months of therapy and returned to baseline levels within four weeks after discontinuation of therapy.</p><p>Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop esomeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high.</p><p><span class="Italics">Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) Cell Effects</span></p><p>In 24-month carcinogenicity studies of omeprazole in rats, a dose-related significant occurrence of gastric ECL cell carcinoid tumors and ECL cell hyperplasia was observed in both male and female animals <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span> Carcinoid tumors have also been observed in rats subjected to fundectomy or long-term treatment with other proton pump inhibitors or high doses of H<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptor antagonists.</p><p>Human gastric biopsy specimens have been obtained from more than 3,000 patients (both children and adults) treated with omeprazole in long-term clinical trials.

The C<span class="Sub">max</span> increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once-daily dosing with 40 mg, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose of 40 mg.

The metabolites of esomeprazole lack antisecretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole's metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite. CYP2C19 isoenzyme exhibits polymorphism in the metabolism of esomeprazole, since some 3% of Caucasians and 15 to 20% of Asians lack CYP2C19 and are termed Poor Metabolizers. At steady state, the ratio of AUC in Poor Metabolizers to AUC in the rest of the population (Extensive Metabolizers) is approximately 2.</p><p>Following administration of equimolar doses, the S- and R-isomers are metabolized differently by the liver, resulting in higher plasma levels of the S- than of the R-isomer.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1 to 1.5 hours.

However, the mean AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone.

In two 24-month oral carcinogenicity studies in rats, omeprazole at daily doses of 1.7, 3.4, 13.8, 44, and 140.8 mg/kg/day (about 0.4 to 34 times the human dose of 40 mg/day expressed on a body surface area basis) produced gastric ECL cell carcinoids in a dose-related manner in both male and female rats; the incidence of this effect was markedly higher in female rats, which had higher blood levels of omeprazole. Gastric carcinoids seldom occur in the untreated rat. In addition, ECL cell hyperplasia was present in all treated groups of both sexes. In one of these studies, female rats were treated with 13.8 mg omeprazole/kg/day (about 3.4 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) for 1 year, then followed for an additional year without the drug. No carcinoids were seen in these rats. An increased incidence of treatment-related ECL cell hyperplasia was observed at the end of 1 year (94% treated vs. 10% controls). By the second year the difference between treated and control rats was much smaller (46% vs. 26%) but still showed more hyperplasia in the treated group. Gastric adenocarcinoma was seen in one rat (2%). No similar tumor was seen in male or female rats treated for 2 years. For this strain of rat no similar tumor has been noted historically, but a finding involving only one tumor is difficult to interpret. A 78-week mouse carcinogenicity study of omeprazole did not show increased tumor occurrence, but the study was not conclusive.</p><p>Esomeprazole was negative in the Ames mutation test, in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> rat bone marrow cell chromosome aberration test, and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus test. Esomeprazole, however, was positive in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test. Omeprazole was positive in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse bone marrow cell chromosome aberration test, and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus test.</p><p>The potential effects of esomeprazole on fertility and reproductive performance were assessed using omeprazole studies. Omeprazole at oral doses up to 138 mg/kg/day in rats (about 34 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) was found to have no effect on reproductive performance of parental animals.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Reproduction Studies</span></p><p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 280 mg/kg/day (about 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 86 mg/kg/day (about 42 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to esomeprazole <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Juvenile Animal Study</span></p><p>A 28-day toxicity study with a 14-day recovery phase was conducted in juvenile rats with esomeprazole magnesium at doses of 70 to 280 mg /kg/day (about 17 to 68 times a daily oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). An increase in the number of deaths at the high dose of 280 mg/kg/day was observed when juvenile rats were administered esomeprazole magnesium from postnatal day 7 through postnatal day 35. In addition, doses equal to or greater than 140 mg/kg/day (about 34 times a daily oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis), produced treatment-related decreases in body weight (approximately 14%) and body weight gain, decreases in femur weight and femur length, and affected overall growth.

A total of 1429 patients were randomized across the 2 studies. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 89 (median age 66.0 years) with 70.7% female, 29.3% male, 82.9% Caucasian, 5.5% Black, 3.7% Asian, and 8.0% Others. At baseline, the patients in these studies were endoscopically confirmed not to have ulcers but were determined to be at risk for ulcer occurrence due to their age (≥60 years) and/or history of a documented gastric or duodenal ulcer within the past 5 years. Patients receiving NSAIDs and treated with esomeprazole magnesium 20 mg or 40 mg once-a-day experienced significant reduction in gastric ulcer occurrences relative to placebo treatment at 26 weeks. See Table 11. No additional benefit was seen with esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg over esomeprazole magnesium 20 mg.
