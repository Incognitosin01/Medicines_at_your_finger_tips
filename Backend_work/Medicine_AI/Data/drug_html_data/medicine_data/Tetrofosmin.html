</ul><h2>Tetrofosmin Description</h2><p class="First">AnazaoHealth’s compounded Tetrofosmin vial is a sterile, non-pyrogenic preparation that consists of a lyophilized mixture of 0.35 mg of Tetrofosmin, 1.5 mg of D-Gluconate, 0.03 mg of Stannous Chloride Dihydrate, 0.48 mg of Disodium Sulphosalicylate, and 2.7 mg of Sodium Hydrogen Carbonate and is maintained under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. It contains no antimicrobrial preservative.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Tetrofosmin is a diagnostic agent used to assess areas of reversible myocardial ischemia in the presence or absence of infracted myocardium and is also used to assess ventricular function.</p><p><span class="Bold">PHYSICAL HALF-LIFE &amp; TARGET ORGANS</span></p><p>The physical half-life of technetium, Tc99m, is 6 hours and has a principal radiation emission of gamma photons with a mean energy of 140 KeV.</p><p>Dose calculations were performed using the standard MIRD method (MIRD Pamphlet No.1 (rev),Society of Nuclear Medicine, 1976).</p><p>Effective dose equivalents (EDE) were calculated in accordance with ICRP 53 (Ann. ICRP 18 (1-4),1988) and gave values of 8.61 × 10-3 mSV/MBq and 1.12 × 10-2 mSV/MBq after exercise and rest, respectively.</p><h2>Tetrofosmin - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The structural formula for Tetrofosmin is:</p><p>When Tetrofosmin is reconstituted with Tc99m pertechnetate, a complex of Tc99m Tetrofosmin is formed and is the active ingredient of the reconstituted product. When administered intravenously, Tc99m Tetrofosmin shows rapid myocardial uptake and its distribution follows a linear relationship with coronary blood flow.</p><p>Tc99m Tetrofosmin is a lipophilic agent that is taken up by the mitochondria of myocardial cells by passive diffusion and appears to accumulate in viable myocardial tissue.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">There are no known contraindications for this preparation.</p><h2>DOSE AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">Depending on the protocol for rest/stress imaging, doses of 10 to 30 mCi (370 to 1110 MBq) are given intravenously</p><p><span class="Bold">PREPARATION</span></p><p><span class="Bold">STORAGE</span></p><p>The preparation should be stored in the refrigerator at 2- 8(C (36 - 46(F) and protected from light.</p><h2>PACKAGE LABEL.PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL</h2><h2>More about tetrofosmin</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
