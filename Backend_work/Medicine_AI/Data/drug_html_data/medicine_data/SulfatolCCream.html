</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Rx Only</span></p><p>The Sulfatol C brand name has been discontinued in the U.S. If generic versions of this product have been approved by the FDA, there may be generic equivalents available.</p><h2>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Sulfatol C™ Cream</span> (sulfacetamide sodium 10% and sulfur 5%) is available by prescription only and contains the following active ingredients: Sulfacetamide Sodium 10% and Sulfur 5%.</p><p>Chemically, sulfacetamide sodium is Acetamide, N-[(4-aminophenyl) sulfonyl], monosodium salt, monohydrate. The structural formula is:</p><p><span class="Bold">INACTIVE INGREDIENTS:</span> Benzyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Cocoglycerides, Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Glyceryl and PEG-100 Stearate, Isopropyl Myristate, Light Mineral Oil, Polysorbate 60, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Thiosulfate, Sorbitan Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Urea, Purified Water, Xanthan Gum, Zinc Ricinoleate.</p><h2>Sulfatol C Cream - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods-Fildes theory, which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth. While absorption through intact skin has not been determined, sulfacetamide sodium is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine, largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours. The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown, but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of <span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes</span> and the formation of free fatty acids.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Sulfatol C™ Cream</span> (sulfacetamide sodium 10% and sulfur 5%) is indicated for the topical control of acne vulgaris, acne rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Sulfatol C™ Cream</span> is contraindicated for use by patients having known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, sulfur or any other component of this preparation. <span class="Bold">Sulfatol C™ Cream</span> is not to be used by patients with kidney disease.</p><p><span class="Bold">FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY. Keep out of reach of children. Keep away from eyes. Keep tube tightly closed.</span></p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Although rare, sensitivity to sulfacetamide sodium may occur. Therefore, caution and careful supervision should be observed when prescribing this drug for patients who may be prone to hypersensitivity to topical sulfonamides. Systemic toxic reactions such as agranulocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, purpura hemorrhagica, drug fever, jaundice, and contact dermatitis indicate hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Particular caution should be employed if areas of denuded or abraded skin are involved.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">If irritation develops, use of the product should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Patients should be carefully observed for possible local irritation or sensitization during long-term therapy. The object of this therapy is to achieve desquamation without irritation, but sulfacetamide sodium and sulfur can cause reddening and scaling of the epidermis. These side effects are not unusual in the treatment of acne vulgaris but patients should be cautioned about the possibility.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Sulfatol C™ Cream</span> is intended for external use only. Avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, lips, other mucous membranes (e.g., inside the nose), and any damaged areas of the skin, such as wounds or open sores. If accidental contact with one of these areas occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with <span class="Bold">Sulfatol C™ Cream</span>. It also is not known whether <span class="Bold">Sulfatol C™ Cream</span> can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. <span class="Bold">Sulfatol C™ Cream</span> should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether sulfacetamide sodium is excreted in human milk following topical use of <span class="Bold">Sulfatol C™ Cream</span>. However, small amounts of orally administered sulfonamides have been reported to be eliminated in human milk. In view of this and because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when <span class="Bold">Sulfatol C™ Cream</span> is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children under 12 years of age has not been established.</p><h2>Possible Side Effects</h2><p class="First">Like any medication, <span class="Bold">Sulfatol C™ Cream</span> may occasionally cause side effects in some people. Although uncommon, some possible side effects may include skin irritation such as redness, dryness, itching or swelling. If you experience excessive skin irritation, contact your physician.</p><h2>Directions For Use</h2><p class="First">Apply <span class="Bold">Sulfatol C™ Cream</span> to affected area(s) 1-3 times daily, or as directed by your physician.</p><p>Then, increase application frequency to 2-3 times daily or as directed by your physician.</p><h2>How is Sulfatol C Cream Supplied</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Sulfatol C™ Cream</span> (sulfacetamide sodium 10% and sulfur 5%) is available in 1 oz. tubes.
