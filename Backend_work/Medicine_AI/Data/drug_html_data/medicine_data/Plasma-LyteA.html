</ul><h2>Plasma-Lyte A Description</h2><p class="First">Plasma-Lyte A Injection pH 7.4 (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution in a single dose container for intravenous administration. Each 100 mL contains 526 mg of Sodium Chloride, USP (NaCl); 502 mg of Sodium Gluconate (C<span class="Sub">6</span>H<span class="Sub">11</span>NaO<span class="Sub">7</span>); 368 mg of Sodium Acetate Trihydrate, USP (C<span class="Sub">2</span>H<span class="Sub">3</span>NaO<span class="Sub">2</span>•3H<span class="Sub">2</span>O); 37 mg of Potassium Chloride, USP (KCl); and 30 mg of Magnesium Chloride, USP (MgCl<span class="Sub">2</span>•6H<span class="Sub">2</span>O). It contains no antimicrobial agents. The pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide. The pH is 7.4 (6.5 to 8.0).</p><p>Plasma-Lyte A Injection pH 7.4 (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) administered intravenously has value as a source of water, electrolytes, and calories. One liter has an ionic concentration of 140 mEq sodium, 5 mEq potassium, 3 mEq magnesium, 98 mEq chloride, 27 mEq acetate, and 23 mEq gluconate. The osmolarity is 294 mOsmol/L (calc). Normal physiologic osmolarity range is 280 to 310 mOsmol/L. The caloric content is 21 kcal/L.</p><p>The VIAFLEX plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride (PL 146 Plastic). The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period, e.g., di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), up to 5 parts per million. However, the safety of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies.</p><h2>Plasma-Lyte A - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Plasma-Lyte A Injection pH 7.4 (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) has value as a source of water and electrolytes.
