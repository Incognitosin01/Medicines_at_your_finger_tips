For maximum control and prevention of reinfestation, it is recommended that puppies be treated at 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks of age. Lactating bitches should be treated 2-3 weeks after whelping. Adult dogs kept in heavily contaminated quarters may be treated at monthly intervals to prevent <span class="Italics">T. Canis</span> reinfestation. Administer one full teaspoonful (5mL) for each 5lb of body weight.  <br/>
<br/>
For the removal of large roundworms (ascarids) and hookworms, put one full teaspoonful (5mL) for each 5 lb of dog’s body weight in the animal’s food bowl. To assure proper dosage, weigh animal prior to treatment. Dogs usually find this wormer very palatable and will lick the dose from the bowl willingly. If there is reluctance to accept the dose, mix in a small quantity of dog food to encourage consumption. It is not necessary to withhold food from your dog prior to treatment.  <br/>
<br/>
The presence of large roundworms (ascarids) and hookworms should be confirmed by laboratory fecal examination. It is recommended that dogs maintained under conditions of constant exposure to worm infestation should have a follow-up fecal exam within 2 to 4 weeks after first treatment.  <br/>
<br/>
If your dog looks or acts sick, consult your veterinarian before treatment.<br/>
