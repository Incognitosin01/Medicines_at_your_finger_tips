Sunscreen will not protect you from severe sunburn during the 30-day period after your treatment with Photofrin.</p><p>Your sensitivity to light may last for up to 90 days or longer. Ask your doctor to determine if your skin is still sensitive to sunlight.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Expose a small area of skin to direct sunlight or bright indoor light for about 10 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not use the skin on your face or around your eyes to test for light sensitivity.</p>

<li>
<p>Test your skin again if your sunlight exposure will increase due to travel or relocation within 90 days after you receive Photofrin.</p>
