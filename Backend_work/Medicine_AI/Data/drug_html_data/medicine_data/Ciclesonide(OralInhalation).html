Des-ciclesonide has a high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and exhibits anti-inflammatory activity. The mechanism of action for corticosteroids is believed to be a combination of three important properties − anti-inflammatory activity, immunosuppressive properties, and antiproliferative actions.</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>52% (lung deposition)</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p> V<sub>d</sub>: Ciclesonide: 2.9 L/kg; des-ciclesonide: 12.1 L/kg </p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Ciclesonide hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, des-ciclesonide via esterases in nasal mucosa and lungs; des-ciclesonide undergoes further hepatic metabolism primarily via  CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent via CYP2D6 </p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Feces (66%); urine (≤20% as active metabolite) </p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p> &gt;4 weeks for maximum benefit </p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>~1 hour (des-ciclesonide)</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Ciclesonide: 0.7 hours; des-ciclesonide: 6 to 7 hours</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>≥99%</p><h2>Special Populations: Hepatic Function Impairment</h2><p>C<sub>max</sub> of des-ciclesonide in patients with moderate to severe liver impairment increased 1.4- to 2.7-fold after oral inhalation. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Asthma:</b> Maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy in patients ≥12 years of age.</p><p>Limitations of use: Not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to ciclesonide or any component of the formulation; status asthmaticus or other acute asthma episodes requiring intensive measures</p><p>Documentation of allergenic cross-reactivity for corticosteroids is limited.

After symptoms stabilize or after a maximum of 14 days of quadrupled dose, whichever occurs first, patients should be returned to their baseline dose (GINA 2019). Quadrupling the inhaled corticosteroid dose has been shown to decrease the severity of an asthma exacerbation in select patients. In a randomized trial of adolescents ≥16 years and adults (n=1,871), temporarily quadrupling the inhaled corticosteroid dose when asthma control began to deteriorate resulted in fewer severe asthma exacerbations (ie, less treatment with systemic glucocorticoids or unscheduled appointments for asthma) compared to patients who maintained their inhaled corticosteroid dose (McKeever 2018). No data for quadrupling the dose in patients &lt;16 years of age has been published. Quintupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone) in children 5 to 11 years of age was not shown to reduce the rate of severe exacerbations and may have been associated with adverse effects (decreased linear growth, particularly in patients &lt;8 years of age) (GINA 2019; Jackson 2018).</p><p><i>Conversion from oral systemic corticosteroid to orally-inhaled corticosteroid</i>: Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: Initiation of oral inhalation therapy should begin in patients who have previously been stabilized on oral corticosteroids (OCS). A gradual dose reduction of OCS should begin at least 1 week after starting inhaled therapy. Manufacturer's labeling recommends reducing prednisone dose no more rapidly than 2.5 mg/day on a weekly basis. In the presence of withdrawal symptoms, resume previous OCS dose for 1 week before attempting further dose reductions.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Maintenance therapy: Alvesco Inhaler 100 mcg/inhalation and 200 mcg/inhalation [Canadian products]: Metered-dose inhaler: Oral inhalation:</p><p>Children 6 to 11 years:</p><p>Initial: 100 to 200 mcg once daily.</p><p>Maintenance: 100 to 200 mcg/day.</p><p>Children ≥12 years and Adolescents:</p><p>Initial: 400 mcg once daily; more severe asthma may require 400 mcg twice daily.</p><p>Maintenance: 100 to 800 mcg/day.</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance.

HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis. Withdrawal and discontinuation of a corticosteroid should be done slowly and carefully. Particular care is required when patients are transferred from systemic corticosteroids to inhaled products due to possible adrenal insufficiency or withdrawal from steroids, including an increase in allergic symptoms. Adult patients receiving ≥20 mg per day of prednisone (or equivalent) may be most susceptible. Fatalities have occurred due to adrenal insufficiency in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to aerosol steroids; aerosol steroids do <b>not</b> provide the systemic steroid needed to treat patients having trauma, surgery, or infections (particularly gastroenteritis), or other conditions with severe electrolyte loss. Select surgical patients on long-term, high-dose, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), should be given stress doses of hydrocortisone intravenously during the surgical period and the dose reduced rapidly within 24 hours after surgery (NAEPP 2007).</p><p>• Bronchospasm: Paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening may occur with use of inhaled bronchodilating agents; reaction should be distinguished from inadequate response. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue ciclesonide and institute alternative therapy.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, angioedema, bronchospasm, rash, urticaria) may occur; discontinue use if reaction occurs.</p><p>• Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may also increase the incidence of secondary infection, mask acute infection (including fungal infections), prolong or exacerbate viral infections, or limit response to vaccines. Avoid use, if possible, in patients with ocular herpes, active or quiescent respiratory tuberculosis, or untreated viral, fungal, parasitic, or bacterial systemic infections. Exposure to chickenpox and measles should be avoided; if the patient is exposed, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin or pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin, respectively, may be indicated. If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</p><p>• Oral candidiasis: Local oropharyngeal <i>Candida albicans</i> infections have been reported; if this occurs, treat appropriately while continuing therapy. Patients should be instructed to rinse mouth with water without swallowing after each use.</p><p>• Vasculitis: Rare cases of vasculitis (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [formerly known as Churg-Strauss]) or other eosinophilic conditions (eg, vasculitic rash, decreased pulmonary function, cardiac complications) can occur.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Asthma: Appropriate use: Supplemental steroids (oral or parenteral) may be needed during stress or severe asthma attacks. Use is contraindicated in status asthmaticus or during other acute asthma episodes requiring intensive measures.</p><p>• Bone mineral density: Use with caution in patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral count such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (eg, anticonvulsants or oral corticosteroids); long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with decreases in bone mineral density.</p><p>• Ocular disease: Use with caution in patients with cataracts and/or glaucoma; blurred vision, increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataracts have occurred with prolonged use. Consider routine eye exams in chronic users.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Pediatric: Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients (~1 cm per year [range: 0.3 to 1.8 cm per year] and related to dose and duration of exposure). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, each patient should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. Growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Discontinuation of therapy: A gradual tapering of dose may be required prior to discontinuing therapy; there have been reports of systemic corticosteroid withdrawal symptoms (eg, joint/muscle pain, lassitude, depression) when withdrawing oral inhalation therapy.</p><p>• Transfer to oral inhaler: When transferring to oral inhalation therapy from systemic corticosteroid therapy, previously suppressed allergic conditions (rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, and eosinophilic conditions) may be unmasked. Withdraw systemic corticosteroid therapy by gradually tapering the dose. Monitor lung function, beta-agonist use, asthma symptoms, and for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (eg, fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea/vomiting, hypotension) during withdrawal.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>FEV<sub>1</sub>, peak flow, and/or other pulmonary function tests; bone mineral density; growth (adolescents and children via stadiometry); signs/symptoms of HPA axis suppression/adrenal insufficiency; possible eosinophilic conditions (including eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [formerly known as Churg-Strauss]); signs/symptoms of oral candidiasis; asthma symptoms; glaucoma/cataracts</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
C

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Maternal use of inhaled corticosteroids in usual doses are not associated with an increased risk of fetal malformations; a small risk of malformations was observed in one study following high maternal doses of an alternative inhaled corticosteroid (ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020]; GINA 2020). Hypoadrenalism may occur in infants born to mothers receiving corticosteroids during pregnancy.</p><p>Uncontrolled asthma is associated with adverse events on pregnancy (increased risk of perinatal mortality, preeclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight infants, cesarean delivery, and the development of gestational diabetes). Poorly controlled asthma or asthma exacerbations may have a greater fetal/maternal risk than what is associated with appropriately used asthma medications. Maternal treatment improves pregnancy outcomes by reducing the risk of some adverse events (eg, preterm birth, gestational diabetes) (ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020]; GINA 2020).</p><p>Inhaled corticosteroids are recommended for the treatment of asthma during pregnancy (GINA 2020). Ciclesonide oral inhalation is considered probably acceptable for use during pregnancy. Pregnant females adequately controlled on ciclesonide for asthma may continue therapy; if initiating treatment during pregnancy, use of an agent with more data in pregnant females may be preferred. The lowest dose that maintains asthma control should be used. Maternal asthma symptoms should be monitored monthly during pregnancy (ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020]).</p><p>Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes associated with asthma and the medications used to treat asthma in pregnancy is ongoing. Health care providers are encouraged to enroll exposed pregnant females in the MotherToBaby Pregnancy Studies conducted by the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (877-311-8972 or https://mothertobaby.org). Patients may also enroll themselves.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat asthma.</p><p>• Do not use this drug to treat an asthma attack.
