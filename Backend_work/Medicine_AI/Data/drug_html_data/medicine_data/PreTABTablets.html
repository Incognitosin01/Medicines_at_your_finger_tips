</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION:</span> PreTAB tablet (PNV-Ca with <span class="Italics">29 mg Fe; 1 mg FA)</span> is an orally administered PRENATAL / POSTNATAL prescription folate specifically formulated for the dietary management of patients with unique nutritional needs requiring increased folate levels.</p><p>PreTAB tablet (PNV-Ca with <span class="Italics">29 mg Fe; 1 mg FA)</span> should be administered under the supervision of a licensed medical practitioner.</p><p>Each pink tablet contains the following dietary ingredients:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Other Ingredients:</span> Calcium Carbonate (Min 37% Ca) Granular USP98 Kosher, Microcrystalline Cellulose Kosher, Croscarmellose Sodium Kosher, Magnesium Stearate Kosher, Silicon Dioxide Kosher, FD&amp;C Red # 40 (Lakes), and other ancillary ingredients as needed to ensure product stability.</p><p><span class="Bold">Caution: Contains FD&amp;C Red # 40 (Lakes).1</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ALLERGY STATEMENT:</span> This product has been manufactured in a facility that also manufactures products containing tree nuts, peanuts, fish, egg, wheat, milk, soy and shellfish. Individuals with allergic tendencies to these substances should use discretion.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PHARMACOLOGY:</span> <span class="Bold">FOLATE</span> - Folates are best known for reducing the incidence of fetal neural tube defects (NTDs).<span class="Sup">2</span> NTDs are congenital malformations produced by failure of the neural tube to form and close properly during embryonic development.<span class="Sup">2</span> During the first four weeks of pregnancy - when many women do not even realize that they have conceived, adequate maternal folate intake is essential to reduce the risk of NTDs. As the postnatal period approaches there is increased demand again for folate regardless of lactation status. Folate is involved in transformylation and methylation metabolism as well as - indirectly, succinylation metabolism (through the “methyl trap” hypothesis). Folate plays a central role in the formation of nucleic acid precursors, such as thymidylic acid and purine nucleotides, which are essential for nucleic acid synthesis and cell division. IOM/NAS (1998) noted that the evidence for a protective effect from folate supplements is much stronger than that for food folate.<span class="Sup">3</span> Other dietary ingredients are added to folate as cofactors, coenzymes and co-metabolites; in studies by Czeizel and Dudas (1992) and Berry et al. (1999), factors other than folate intakes may affect the magnitude of risk reduction or participate in a co-protective effect with folate.<span class="Sup">3</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOLATE MECHANISM OF ACTION:</span> FOLATE is essential for the production of certain coenzymes in many metabolic systems such as purine and pyrimidine synthesis. It is also essential in the synthesis and maintenance of nucleoprotein in erythropoiesis. It also promotes white blood cell (WBC) and platelet production in folate-deficiency anemia. Folate is associated with methylation and transformylation biochemistry.<span class="Sup">4</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOLATE REGULATION:</span> The Federal Register Notices from 1971 to 1973 established that increased folate was proper therapy in megaloblastic anemias of tropical and nontropical sprue, nutritional origin, pregnancy, infancy and childhood.<span class="Sup">5,6,7</span> Folate metabolism can be affected by malabsorption issues which differ widely among population groups. The March 5, 1996 Federal Register Notice (61 FR 8760) states that “The agency concluded that <span class="Bold Italics">the scientific literature did not support the superiority of any one source of folate over others, and that the data were insufficient to provide a basis for stating that a specific amount of folate is more effective than another amount</span> [emphasis added].<span class="Sup">8”</span> The actual amount and source of folate require a licensed medical practitioner’s supervision to achieve a satisfactory maintenance level, and may exceed the 0.8 mg UL. The Federal Register Notice of August 2, 1973 (38 FR 20750) specifically states that “dietary supplement preparations are available without a prescription (21 CFR 121.1134). <span class="Bold Italics">Levels higher than dietary supplement amounts are available only with a prescription. Oral preparations supplying more than 0.8 mg of folate per dosage unit would be restricted to prescription dispensing</span> and that a dietary supplement furnishing 0.8 mg <span class="Italics">could be</span> prescribed when a maintenance level of 0.8 mg per day was indicated ... When clinical symptoms have subsided and the blood picture and/or CSF folate levels have become normal, a maintenance level should be used. Patients should be kept under close supervision and adjustment of the maintenance level made if relapse appears imminent. In the presence of alcoholism, hemolytic anemia, anticonvulsant therapy, or chronic infection, the maintenance level may need to be increased [emphasis added]."<span class="Sup">9</span> However, once the level of active folate exceeds 0.8 mg - as prescribed dosages, then the product is no longer a medical food but a <span class="Bold">dietary management / prescription (R<span class="Sub">x</span>)-folate</span> regardless of pregnancy/lactation status in spite of the fact that folic acid - including reduced forms, may be added to medical foods as defined in section 5(b)(3) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 USC 360ee(b)(3)), or to food (21 CFR 172.345).<span class="Sup">10,11</span> In the Letter Regarding Dietary Supplement Health Claim for Folic Acid, Vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span>, and Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> and Vascular Disease (Docket No. 99P-3029) dated November 28, 2000, FDA wrote “... high intakes of folate may partially and temporarily correct pernicious anemia while the neurological damage of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency progresses. IOM/NAS (1998) set the UL for all adults of 1 mg per day because of devastating and irreversible neurological consequences of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency, the data suggesting that <span class="Bold Italics">pernicious anemia may develop at a younger age in some racial or ethnic groups, and the uncertainty about the extent of the occurrence of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency in <span class="Bold">younger age groups</span></span> (IOM/NAS, 1998) [emphasis added]."<span class="Sup">12</span> Summary: This product is a dietary management product that - due to advanced folate levels, requires administration under the care of a licensed medical practitioner, and the most appropriate way to do that is to provide the product as prescription for pedigree reporting and safety monitoring. The ingredients, indication or claims of this product are not to be construed to be drug claims.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING:</span> Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS:</span> Allergic reactions have been reported following the use of oral and parenteral folate. Call your medical practitioner about side effects.</p><p>Mild transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, itching, transitory exanthema and the feeling of swelling of the entire body has been associated with cobalamin.</p><p>Paresthesia, somnolence, nausea, and headaches have been reported with pyridoxine.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PATIENT INFORMATION: This product</span> is a dietary management / prescription (R<span class="Sub">x</span>) folate supplement to be used only under licensed medical supervision. Your licensed medical practitioner may choose to prescribe this product along with other medications.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE: This product</span> is indicated for the distinct nutritional requirements of individuals who have suboptimal folates levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and/or red blood cells, and require a maintenance level. Folate is effective in the treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia and/or megaloblastic anemias,<span class="Sup">13</span> (as may be seen in tropical or nontropical sprue) and in anemias of nutritional origin,<span class="Sup">14</span> pregnancy, infancy, childhood or other related folate-malabsorption complications of an inborn or environmental origin.</p><p><span class="Bold">KEEP THIS PRODUCT OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INTERACTIONS:</span> Always talk to your healthcare practitioner and/or pharmacist before taking or using any prescription or over-the-counter medicines or herbal/health supplements alongside <span class="Bold">this product</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DRUG INTERACTIONS:</span> Drugs which may interact with folate include but are not limited to:</p><ul>
<li>First generation anticonvulsants: High dose folate may result in decreased serum levels for first generation anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, valproic acid, valproate). This may possibly reduce the effectiveness of first generation anticonvulsants and/or increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible patients. Caution should be used when prescribing folates among patients who are receiving treatment with first generation anticonvulsants.</li>
<li>Second-generation anticonvulsants: Information on the effect of second-generation anticonvulsants (including, but not limited to, lamotrigine) on folate levels is limited and interactions cannot be ruled out.</li>
<li>Capecitabine: Folinic acid (5-formyltetrahydrofolate) may increase the toxicity of capecitabine.</li>
<li>Cholestyramine: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.</li>
<li>Colestipol: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.</li>
<li>Colchicine: Colchicine may decrease folate plasma levels.</li>
<li>Levodopa: Levodopa may decrease folate plasma levels.</li>
<li>Cycloserine: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.</li>
<li>Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitors (DHFRI): DHFRIs block the conversion of folic acid to its active forms, and lower plasma and red blood cell folate levels. DHFRIs include aminopterin, methotrexate, pyrimethamine, triamterene, and trimethoprim. Caution should be exercised when using folate with folate antagonists. Patients, typically, should not be given folate simultaneously with a folate antagonist, for the purpose of reducing or preventing clinical toxicity, as the therapeutic effect of the antagonist may be nullified.</li>
<li>Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine exerts a noncompetitive inhibition of the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate active transport in the intestine.</li>
<li>Isotretinoin: Reduced folate levels have occurred in some patients taking isotretinoin.</li>
<li>Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs have been shown to inhibit some folate dependent enzymes in laboratory experiments. NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin and sulindac.</li>
<li>Oral Contraceptives: Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy.</li>
<li>Methylprednisolone: Reduced serum folate levels have been noted after treatment with methylprednisolone.</li>
<li>Pancreatic Enzymes, including, but not limited to pancreatin and pancrelipase: Reduced folate levels have occurred in some patients taking pancreatic extracts.</li>
<li>Pentamidine: Reduced folate levels have been seen with prolonged intravenous pentamidine.</li>
<li>Smoking and Alcohol: Reduced serum folate levels have been noted.</li>
<li>Sulfasalazine: Inhibits the absorption and metabolism of folic acid.</li>
<li>Metformin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes decreases serum folate.</li>
<li>Warfarin can produce significant impairment in folate status after a 6-month therapy.</li>
<li>Folate may enhance the toxicity of fluorouracil.</li>
<li>Concurrent administration of chloramphenicol and folate in folate-deficient patients may result in antagonism of the haematopoietic response to folate.</li>
<li>Caution should be exercised with the concomitant use of folate and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the acute treatment of <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis carinii</span> pneumonia in patients with HIV infection as it is associated with increased rates of treatment failure and mortality in a placebo controlled study.</li>
</ul><p>Drugs which may interact with vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span> include but are not limited to:</p><ul>
<li>Vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span> should not be given to patients receiving the drug levodopa because the action of levodopa may be antagonized by vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span>. Vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span> may or may not interfere with levodopa even when used concurrently with carbidopa.</li>
</ul><p>Drugs which may interact with vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> include but are not limited to:</p><ul>
<li>Antibiotics, cholestyramine, colchicines, colestipol, metformin, para-aminosalicylic acid, and potassium chloride may decrease the absorption of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>.</li>
<li>Nitrous oxide can produce a functional vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency.</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS: This product</span> is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components contained in <span class="Bold">this product</span>. This product is contraindicated for individuals with conditions for which any of the ingredients are contraindicated.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span> Caution is recommended in patients with a history of bipolar illness as mood elevation is possible following coadministration of folate with antidepressant therapy.</p><p>Caution is also recommended in patients taking anticonvulsant medications as folate may interfere with anticonvulsant medication, and may lower seizure threshold. Furthermore, it has been reported that anticonvulsant medications interfere with folate metabolism, but the exact action is unclear; therefore caution is recommended with patients in this therapeutic group.</p><p>Folinic acid may enhance the toxicity of fluorouracil. Deaths from severe enterocolitis, diarrhea, and dehydration have been reported in elderly patients receiving weekly formyl-THF and fluorouracil. Concomitant granulocytopenia and fever were present in some but not all of the patients. The concomitant use of formyl-THF with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the acute treatment of <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis carinii</span> pneumonia in patients with HIV infection was associated with increased rates of treatment failure and mortality in a placebo controlled study.<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p>Patients undergoing cancer treatment should consult their licensed medical practitioner for advice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> Folate alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is deficient. Folate in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations progress.</p><h2>REFERENCES:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PHARMACOLOGY:</span> <span class="Bold">FOLATE</span> - Folates are best known for reducing the incidence of fetal neural tube defects (NTDs).
