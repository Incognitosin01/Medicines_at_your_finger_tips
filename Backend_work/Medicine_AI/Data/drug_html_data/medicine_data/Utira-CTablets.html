It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly distributed throughout the body tissues. Most is excreted in the urine within 12 hours, 13% to 50% being unchanged. Its biotransformation is hepatic. Its protein binding is moderate.</p><p>METHENAMINE degrades in an acidic urine environment releasing formaldehyde which provides bactericidal or bacteriostatic action. It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. 70%-90% reaches the urine unchanged at which point it is hydrolyzed if the urine is acidic. Within 24 hours it is almost completely (90%) excreted; of this at a pH of 5, approximately 20% is formaldehyde. Protein binding - some formaldehyde is bound to substances in the urine and surrounding tissues. Methenamine is freely distributed to body tissue and fluids but is not clinically significant as it does not hydrolyze at pH greater than 6.8.</p><p>METHYLENE BLUE possesses weak antiseptic properties. It is well absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and rapidly reduced to leukomethylene blue which is stabilized in some combination form in the urine. 75% is excreted unchanged.</p><p>PHENYL SALICYLATE releases salicylate, a mild analgesic for pain.</p><p>SODIUM PHOSPHATE MONOBASIC an acidifier, helps to maintain an acid pH in the urine necessary for the degradation of methenamine.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Utira-C Tablets</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Utira <span class="Sup">®</span>-C</span> tablets are indicated for the treatment of symptoms of irritative voiding. Indicated for the relief of local symptoms, such as inflammation, hypermotility, and pain, which accompany lower urinary tract infections. Indicated for the relief of urinary tract symptoms caused by diagnostic procedures.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients is possible. Risk benefits should be carefully considered when the following medical problems exist: cardiac disease (especially cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, and mitral stenosis); gastrointestinal tract obstructive disease; glaucoma; myasthenia gravis, acute urinary retention may be precipitated in obstructive uropathy (such as bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy).</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Do not exceed recommended dosage. If rapid pulse, dizziness or blurring of vision occurs discontinue use immediately.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cross sensitivity and/or related problems</span> - Patients intolerant of belladonna alkaloids or salicylates may be intolerant of this medication also. Delay in gastric emptying could complicate the management of gastric ulcers.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy/Reproduction (FDA Pregnancy Category C)</span> - Hyoscyamine and methenamine cross the placenta. Studies concerning the effect of hyoscyamine and methenamine on pregnancy and reproduction have not been done in animals or humans. Thus it is not known whether <span class="Bold">Utira <span class="Sup">®</span>-C</span> tablets cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. <span class="Bold">Utira <span class="Sup">®</span>-C</span> tablets should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Breast feeding</span> - Problems in humans have not been documented; however, methenamine and traces of hyoscyamine are excreted in breast milk. Accordingly, <span class="Bold">Utira <span class="Sup">®</span>-C</span> tablets should be given to a nursing mother with caution and only if clearly needed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Prolonged use</span> - There have been no studies to establish the safety of prolonged use in humans. No known long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric use</span> - Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effect of the belladonna alkaloids.</p><p><span class="Bold">Geriatric use</span> - Use with caution in elderly patients as they may respond to usual doses of hyoscyamine with excitement, agitation, drowsiness or confusion.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Cardiovascular: rapid heartbeat, flushing<br/>
Central Nervous System: blurred vision, dizziness, drowsiness<br/>
Genitourinary: difficult micturition, acute urinary retention<br/>
Gastrointestinal: dry mouth, nausea and vomiting<br/>
Respiratory: shortness of breath or trouble breathing</p><p>Serious allergic reactions to this drug are rare. Seek immediate medical attention if you notice symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including itching, rash, severe dizziness, swelling or trouble breathing.</p><p>This medication can cause urine and sometimes stools to turn blue to blue-green. This effect is harmless and will subside after medication is stopped.</p><p><span class="Bold">Call your doctor or physician for medical advice about side effects. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mission Pharmacal at 1-800-845-7827 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088, www.fda.gov/medwatch.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Drug interactions</span> - As a result of hyoscyamine’s effects on gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying, absorption of other oral medications may be decreased during concurrent use with this combination medication.</p><p><span class="Bold">Urinary alkalizers and thiazide diuretics:</span> May cause the urine to become alkaline reducing the effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antimuscarinics:</span> Concurrent use may intensify antimuscarinic effects of hyoscyamine because of secondary antimuscarinic activities of these medications.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antacids/antidiarrheals:</span> Concurrent use may reduce absorption of hyoscyamine resulting in decreased therapeutic effectiveness. Concurrent use with antacids may cause urine to become alkaline reducing effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde. Doses of these medications should be spaced 1 hour apart from doses of hyoscyamine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antimyasthenics:</span> Concurrent use with hyoscyamine may further reduce intestinal motility, therefore caution is recommended.</p><p>Ketoconazole and hyoscyamine may cause increased gastrointestinal pH. Concurrent administration with hyoscyamine may result in marked reduction in the absorption of ketaconazole. Patients should be advised to take this combination at least 2 hours after ketoconazole.</p><p><span class="Bold">Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors:</span> Concurrent use with hyoscyamine may intensify antimuscarinic side effects.</p><p>Opioid (narcotic) analgesics may result in increased risk of severe constipation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Sulfonamides:</span> These drugs may precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine increasing the danger of crystalluria.</p><p>Patients should be advised that the urine may become blue to blue-green and the feces may be discolored as a result of the excretion of the methylene blue.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><p class="First">A dependence on the use of <span class="Bold">Utira <span class="Sup">®</span>-C</span> tablets has not been reported and due to the nature of its ingredients, abuse of <span class="Bold">Utira <span class="Sup">®</span>-C</span> tablets is not expected.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Emesis or gastric lavage. Slow intravenous administration of physostigmine in doses of 1 to 4 mg (0.5 to 1 mg in children), repeated as needed in one to two hours to reverse severe antimuscarinic symptoms.</p><p>Administration of small doses of diazepam to control excitement and seizures. Artificial respiration with oxygen if needed for respiratory depression. Adequate hydration. Symptomatic treatment as necessary.</p><p>If overdose is suspected, contact your local Poison Control Center or emergency room immediately. US residents can contact the US National Poison Hotline at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2>Utira-C Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span> - one tablet orally 4 times per day followed by liberal fluid intake.<br/>
