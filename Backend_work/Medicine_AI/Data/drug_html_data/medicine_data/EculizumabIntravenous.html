<html><head></head><body><h1>Eculizumab (Intravenous)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> eculizumab (e-kue-LIZ-oo-mab)</p><p>Meningococcal infections, which may rapidly become life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early, have been reported in patients treated with eculizumab. Comply with the most current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for meningococcal vaccination in patients with complement deficiencies. Immunize patients with a meningococcal vaccine at least 2 weeks prior to administering the first dose of eculizumab, unless the risks of delaying eculizumab therapy outweigh the risk of developing a meningococcal infection. Vaccination reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of meningococcal infections. Monitor patients for early signs of meningococcal infections and evaluate immediately if infection is suspected. Eculizumab is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Under the eculizumab REMS prescribers must enroll in the program. Enrollment in the eculizumab REMS program and additional information are available by telephone: 1-888-SOLIRIS (1-888-765-4747) or at solirisrems.com .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

It is used in patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive.</p><p>Eculizumab injection is a monoclonal antibody that works on the immune system.</p><p>Eculizumab is available only under a restricted distribution program called Soliris® REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) Program.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using eculizumab</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For eculizumab, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to eculizumab or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of eculizumab injection to treat <i>atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome</i> in children. However, safety and efficacy of eculizumab injection to treat other conditions have not been established in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of eculizumab injection in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving eculizumab, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using eculizumab with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>
<li>Tofacitinib</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of eculizumab. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Infection—Use with caution. Eculizumab may decrease your body’s ability to fight infection.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Meningococcal infection—Should not be given to patients with this condition.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>No current vaccination against meningitis infection—Should not be given to patients with this condition unless the doctor decides that urgent treatment is needed.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Neutropenia (low white blood cells) or</li>
<li>Weak immune system—Use with caution. May cause side effects to become worse and increase risks for infection.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of eculizumab</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you eculizumab. Eculizumab is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. It must be injected slowly, so your IV tube will need to stay in place for at least 35 minutes in adults and 1 to 4 hours in children.</p><p>It is very important that you understand the requirements of the Soliris® REMS program, and become familiar with the Soliris® medication guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions. Ask your pharmacist for the medication guide if you do not have one.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using eculizumab</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that eculizumab is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Eculizumab may increase your chance of having serious infections, including a meningococcal infection. Avoid people who are sick or have infections. Tell your doctor right away if you develop headaches, nausea, vomiting, fever, a stiff neck or back, a rash, confusion, muscle aches, or if your eyes have become sensitive to light. Make sure you have received a vaccine to prevent meningococcus infections at least 2 weeks before you receive eculizumab. You may also be given antibiotic medicines for 2 weeks to prevent infections if you are to use eculizumab right away. If you have already received the meningococcal vaccine in the past, your doctor will decide if you need another dose.</p><p>Ask your doctor for a patient safety card. This card will list the symptoms of meningococcus infections and what to do if you have them. Carry the card with you at all times during treatment and for 3 months after your last dose. You will need to show the card to any doctor who treats you.</p><p><i>For patients with PNH:</i> When eculizumab is stopped you could have red blood cell destruction or breakdown (hemolysis). Your doctor will need to monitor you closely for at least 8 weeks after you stop using eculizumab. Be sure to keep all appointments.</p><p><i>For patients with aHUS:</i> Your doctor may also need to check for blood clots in your small blood vessels, called thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) for at least 12 weeks after stopping treatment with eculizumab. The signs and symptoms of TMA include chest pain, difficulty with breathing, mental depression or anxiety, or seizures. Call your doctor right away if you notice any of these signs and symptoms.</p><p>Eculizumab may cause infusion-related reactions. These can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you start to have a fever, chills or shaking, dizziness, trouble breathing, itching or rash, lightheadedness or fainting after receiving eculizumab.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Eculizumab side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
