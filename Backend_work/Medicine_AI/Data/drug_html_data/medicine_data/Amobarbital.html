The 10% solution is ordinarily used; the 20% solution may be used so that a small volume contains a large dose. Rotate vial to dissolve, do not shake. Do not use unless a clear solution forms within 5 minutes; a solution that forms a precipitate after clearing should not be used. Not more than 30 minutes should elapse from the time the vial is opened until its contents are injected.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IM: Administer deeply into a large muscle. Do not use more than 5 mL (irrespective of concentration) at any single site (may cause tissue damage). Use 20% solution to facilitate larger doses. Superficial IM or subcutaneous injections may be painful and produce sterile abscesses or sloughs.</p><p>IV: Use only when IM administration is not feasible. Administer by slow IV injection (maximum rate of infusion: 50 mg/minute in adults). May administer up to 100 mg/minute when performing “Amytal interview” (off-label use; Kavirajan 1999).</p><p>Intra-carotid (off-label route): Wada test (off-label use): Administer dose over 2 to 5 seconds via percutaneous transfemoral catheter into the internal carotid artery (Acharya 1997). </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store intact vials at 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).
