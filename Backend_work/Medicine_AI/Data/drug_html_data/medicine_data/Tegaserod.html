Tegaserod increases the movement of stools (bowel movement) through the bowels. It also decreases pain and discomfort in the stomach area, bloating, and constipation. However, tegaserod does not cure irritable bowel syndrome. If you stop using tegaserod, your symptoms may return in 1 to 2 weeks.</p><p>Tegaserod is also used to treat women younger than 55 years of age who have chronic constipation with an unknown cause.</p><p>Tegaserod was withdrawn from the U.S. market on March 30, 2007, due to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and worsening chest pain that can become a heart attack in patients treated with tegaserod compared to placebo (sugar pills). On July 27, 2007, tegaserod was made available under a restricted access program called treatment IND, however, as of April 2, 2008, tegaserod is no longer available under a treatment IND, and is only available for use in emergency situations. For further information and to see if you qualify for treatment with tegaserod for emergency use, <i>you should consult your doctor</i>. Your doctor will then contact FDA's Division for Drug Information about the emergency IND process at druginfo@fda.hhs.gov.</p><p>Tegaserod is available only with your doctor's prescription and for use in emergency situations.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using tegaserod</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
