<li><strong>increased levels of uric acid in your blood (hyperuricemia).</strong> This can happen within 4 weeks of you starting Nexlizet and continue throughout your treatment. Your healthcare provider may monitor your blood uric acid levels while you are taking Nexlizet. High levels of blood uric acid may lead to gout. Call your healthcare provider if you have the following symptoms of hyperuricemia and gout:
<ul>
<li>severe foot pain especially in the toe joint</li>
<li>warm joints</li>
<li>swelling</li>
<li>tender joints</li>
<li>joint redness</li>
</ul>
Gout may happen more in people who have had gout before but also can happen in people who have never had it before.</li>
<li><strong>tendon rupture or injury.</strong> Tendon problems can happen in people who take bempedoic acid, one of the medicines in Nexlizet. Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones. Symptoms of tendon problems may include pain, swelling, tears, and inflammation of tendons including the arm, shoulder, and back of the ankle (Achilles).
<ul>
<li><strong>Tendon rupture can happen while you are taking Nexlizet.</strong> Tendon ruptures can happen within weeks or months of starting Nexlizet.</li>

<ul>
<li>are over 60 years of age</li>
<li>are taking antibiotics (fluoroquinolones)</li>
<li>have had tendon problems</li>
<li>are taking steroids (corticosteroids)</li>
<li>have renal failure</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>hear or feel a snap or pop in a tendon area</li>
<li>bruising right after an injury in a tendon area</li>
<li>unable to move the affected area or put weight on the affected area</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Talk to your healthcare provider about the risk of tendon rupture</strong> with continued use of Nexlizet. You may need a different lipid lowering medicine to treat your cholesterol levels.</li>
