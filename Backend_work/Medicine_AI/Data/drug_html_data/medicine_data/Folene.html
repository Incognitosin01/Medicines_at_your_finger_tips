Softgels must be administered under the supervision of a licensed medical practitioner to monitor/rule-out pernicious anemia (cobalamin) deficiency.</p><p><span class="Bold">INGREDIENTS:</span></p><p>Each serving of (2) light blue Softgels contains the following ingredients:</p><p>L-methylfolate magnesium ..... 2 mg</p><p>Vitamin D3 ..... 3775 IU</p><p>NAC:Magnesium ..... 100 mg</p><p>Magnesium Citrate..... 500 mg</p><p>Calcium Citrate..... 200 mg</p><p><br/>
Excipients: Soybean Oil, Gelatin (Bovine), Glycerin, Lecithin, Purified Water, Beeswax, Citric Acid, Titanium Dioxide, Natural Creamy Orange Flavor, Ascorbic Acid, L-Glutathione, and FD&amp;C Blue #1. CAUTION: Contains Bovine Gelatin and Soy</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">MECHANISM OF ACTION:</span></p><p>Folates are best known for reducing the incidence of fetal neural tube defects (NTDs).1,2,3 NTDs are congenital malformations produced by failure of the neural tube to form and close properly during embryonic development.3,4 During the first four weeks of pregnancy – when many women do not even realize that they have conceived, adequate maternal folate intake is reported to reduce the risk of NTDs. Folate is also essential in the synthesis and maintenance of nucleoprotein in erythropoiesis. It also promotes white blood cell (WBC) and platelet production in folate-deficiency anemia. Folate is associated with methylation and transformylation biochemistry. Folate is involved in transformylation and methylation metabolism as well as, indirectly, succinylation metabolism (through the “methyl trap” hypothesis). Folate plays a central role in the formation of nucleic acid precursors, such as thymidylic acid and purine nucleotides, which are essential for nucleic acid synthesis and cell division. IOM/NAS (1998) noted that the evidence for a protective effect from folate supplements is much stronger than that for food folate <span class="Sup">.</span>3</p><h2>PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOLATE</span> is essential for the production of certain coenzymes in many metabolic systems such as purine and pyrimidine synthesis. About 70% of food folate and cellular folate is comprised of L-methylfolate. It is the primary form of folate in circulation, and is also the form transported across membranes – particularly across the blood brain barrier – into peripheral tissues. In the cell, L-methylfolate is used in the re-methylation of homocysteine to form methionine and tetrahydrofolate (THF). It has been reported that L-methylfolate supplementation increases the formation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase resulting in increase nitric oxide. <span class="Sup">5</span> This causes vasodilation to the nerves, increasing blood supply to the nerves, and reducing vascular oxidative stress. <span class="Sup">5</span> L-methylfolate supplementation is also reported to increase nitric oxide levels by increasing the amount of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). BH4 is required for nitric oxide synthesis.6 The combination of Vitamin D, magnesium, and calcium have been shown to provide a synergistic affect in elevating blood levels for such deficiencies. <span class="Sup">10</span></p><p><span class="Bold">VITAMIN D</span> regulates calcium homeostasis by maintaining equilibrium (along with parathormone) between calcium resorption and excretion.7 Adequate calcium intake increases Vitamin D levels.7,8 Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin. Unlike water-soluble vitamins, fat-soluble vitamins dissolve in fat and are stored in body tissues. Both Vitamin D and magnesium are required for proper calcium deposition and bone development. <span class="Sup">9</span></p><p><span class="Bold">MAGNESIUM</span> plays an important role in biochemical reactions all over the body. It is involved in many cell transport activities, in addition to helping cells make energy aerobically or anaerobically. Bones are a major reservoir for magnesium, and magnesium is the counter-ion for calcium and potassium in muscle cells, including the heart. <span class="Sup">10</span> Magnesium also is designed to offset calcium. Magnesium contributes to the maintenance of normal bone and teeth. <span class="Sup">11</span> The combination of high doses of Vitamin D and magnesium supplementation improves magnesium absorption and utility. <span class="Sup">8</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Folene</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Folene™</span> is a prescription-folate preparation indicated for the nutritional supplementation for individuals who have suboptimal folate, magnesium, and/or Vitamin D levels in the plasma and require a maintenance level. Folene should be administered only under that direction and supervision of a licensed medical practitioner.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Caution is recommended in patients with a family history of bipolar illness. Mood elevation is possible in this population. Caution is also recommended in patients taking anticonvulsant medications as folate may interfere with anticonvulsant medication, and may lower seizure threshold. Furthermore, it has been reported that anticonvulsant medications interfere with folate metabolism, but the exact action is unclear; therefore caution is recommended with patients in this therapeutic group. Caution is recommended in patients with kidney disease. Patients undergoing cancer treatment should consult their licensed medical practitioner for advice.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Folate alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B12 is deficient. Folate in doses above 1.0 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations progress.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h3><p class="First">Allergic reactions have been reported following the use of oral and parenteral folate. <span class="Sup">14</span> Mild transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, itching, transitory exanthema, and the feeling of swelling of the entire body have been associated with methylcobalamin. <span class="Sup">15</span> Allergic reactions, acne, skin reactions, photosensitivity, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, paresthesia, somnolence, nausea, and headaches have been associated with pyridoxal-5’-phosphate. <span class="Sup">16</span> Call your licensed medical practitioner about side effects.</p><h3>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h3><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the articles contained in this product. This product is contraindicated for individuals with conditions for which any of the ingredients are contraindicated. Talk to your licensed medical practitioner, healthcare practitioner, personal physician, and/or pharmacist before taking or using any prescription, over-the-counter medicines, or herbal/health supplements alongside this product.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drugs which may interact with folate include:</span></p><ul>

The March 5, 1996 Federal Register Notice (61 FR 8760) states “The agency concluded that the scientific literature did not support the superiority of any one source of folate over others, and that the data were insufficient to provide a basis for stating that a specific amount of folate is more effective than another amount" [emphasis added].19 The Federal Register Notice of August 2, 1973 (38 FR 20750) states that “dietary supplement preparations are available without a prescription (21 CFR 121.1134). Levels higher than dietary supplement amounts are available only with a prescription. Oral preparations supplying more than 0.8 mg of folate per dosage unit would be restricted to prescription dispensing and that a dietary supplement furnishing 0.8 mg could be prescribed when a maintenance level of 0.8 mg per day was indicated18” AND ALSO IN THAT FEDERAL REGISTER THAT: • “It was concluded that there is no evidence that doses of folic acid greater than 1mg. daily have greater efficacy than do those of 1mg.” • “Pending review of the status of folic acid by the OTC vitamin-mineral drug panel pursuant to procedures established in S130.301, the FDA will continue on an interim basis its previous policy of regarding any preparation containing folic acid in excess of permitted food additive level as prescription drug.” The Federal Register Notice of August 2, 1973 (38 FR 20750) also states that patients should be kept under supervision of a licensed practitioner and adjustment of the maintenance level made if relapse appears imminent. In the presence of alcoholism, hemolytic anemia, anticonvulsant therapy, or chronic infection, the maintenance level</p><p>may need to be increased [emphasis added].17” In the Letter Regarding Dietary Supplement Health Claim for Folic Acid, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin B12 and Vascular Disease (Docket No. 99P-3029) dated November 28, 2000, FDA wrote “... high intakes of folate may partially and temporarily correct pernicious anemia while the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency progresses. IOM/NAS (1998) set the UL for all adults of 1 mg per day because of devastating and irreversible neurological consequences of vitamin B12 deficiency, the data suggesting that pernicious anemia may develop at a younger age in some racial or ethnic groups, and the uncertainty about the extent of the occurrence of vitamin B12 deficiency in younger age groups (IOM/NAS, 1998) [emphasis added].20”</p><p><span class="Bold">REFERENCES</span></p><p>1.
