When the temperature falls below 10 degrees F, or when wind chill is significant,<br/>
special precautions should be taken to avoid chapped and frozen teats.<br/>
<br/>
1. Teats should be dry before turning cows out into cold weather.<br/>
2. When teats are dipped after milking, allow 30 seconds contact, and blot<br/>
    off any excess teat dip with a single service towel.<br/>
3. Warm the teat dip to reduce drying time.<br/>
4. Provide windbreaks in outside areas for cows.<br/>
5. Monitor fresh cows with swollen udders and teats since they are more<br/>
    susceptible to chapped and frozen teats.</p><ul>
