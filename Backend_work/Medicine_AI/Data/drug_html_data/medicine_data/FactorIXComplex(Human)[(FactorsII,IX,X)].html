Factor IX is a vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor which is synthesized in the liver. Factor IX is activated by factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Activated factor IX (IXa), in combination with factor VII:C, activates factor X to Xa, resulting ultimately in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and the formation of a fibrin clot. The infusion of exogenous factor IX to replace the deficiency present in hemophilia B temporarily restores hemostasis.</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>IX component: ~19 to 25 hours</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Factor IX deficiency (hemophilia B  [Christmas disease]):</b> Prevention and control of bleeding in patients with factor IX deficiency (hemophilia B or Christmas disease) </p><p>Limitations of use: Not indicated for the treatment of other factor deficiencies (eg, factor II, VII, VIII, X), treatment of hemophilia A patients with inhibitors to factor VIII, or treatment of bleeding caused by low levels of liver-dependent coagulation factors.</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Intracranial hemorrhage associated with warfarin</h3><p>Data from a prospective, observational study in patients presenting with warfarin-associated intracranial hemorrhage demonstrated that the use of factor IX complex (ie, 3-factor PCC) (in combination with vitamin K with or without FFP) adequately corrected INR without increased adverse events and suggested improvement in 3-month clinical outcomes as compared to FFP <sup>[Frontera 2014]</sup>. In one retrospective single-center study in patients presenting with warfarin-associated intracranial hemorrhage, the use of factor IX complex (with or without FFP) was associated with serious complications and was incompletely effective in reversing warfarin anticoagulation <sup>[Switzer 2012]</sup>. In another retrospective study with a lower number of patients, the use of factor IX complex suggested benefit when the time to INR normalization was shortened <sup>[Chong 2010]</sup>. Of note, morbidity and mortality were found to remain high in this population regardless of rate of INR reversal with PCC <sup>[Dowlatshahi 2012]</sup>. Additional data are necessary to further define the role of factor IX complex (human) in the management of this condition.</p><p>Based on the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) Guidelines for the Management of Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage, the use of factor IX complex (human) (ie, 3-factor PCC) may be considered for the treatment of intracranial hemorrhage associated with warfarin if it is readily available in the hospital. More recently, the Neurocritical Care Society and Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines for the reversal of antithrombotics in intracranial hemorrhage suggests the use of 3-factor <b>or</b> 4-factor PCC (4-factor PCC preferred) for intracranial hemorrhage associated with warfarin when INR ≥1.4 (fresh frozen plasma may be used if PCC not available).</p><h3>Life-threatening hemorrhage associated with warfarin</h3><p>Clinical experience suggests the utility of factor IX complex (in combination with vitamin K) for the emergent correction of warfarin-induced coagulopathy (with clinically significant bleeding) <sup>[Liumbruno 2009]</sup>. <b>Note:</b> Products contain low or nontherapeutic levels of factor VII component; use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be considered <sup>[Baker 2004]</sup>, <sup>[Holland 2009]</sup>.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Profilnine: There are no contraindications listed in the manufacturer's labeling.</p><p>Bebulin: Hypersensitivity reactions to factor IX complex or any component of the formulation; known allergy to heparin; history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Bebulin has been discontinued in the US for more than 1 year.</p><p><b>Note: Factor IX complex (Human) [Factors II, IX, X] (Bebulin, Profilnine) contains low or nontherapeutic levels of factor VII component</b> and should not be confused with Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (Human) [(Factors II, VII, IX, X), Protein C, Protein S] (Kcentra, Octaplex) which contains therapeutic levels of factor VII.</p><p><b>Control or prevention of bleeding in patients with factor IX deficiency (hemophilia B [Christmas disease]):</b> Dosage is expressed in units of factor IX activity and must be individualized based on severity of factor IX deficiency, extent and location of bleeding, and clinical status of patient.

When clinical response is suboptimal, the patient has reached a specified number of exposure days, or patient is to undergo surgical procedure, screen for inhibitors. Patients with severe hemophilia compared to those with mild or moderate hemophilia are more likely to develop inhibitors (WFH [Srivastava 2013]).</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity and anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with use. Delayed reactions (up to 20 days after infusion) in previously untreated patients may also occur. Due to potential for allergic reactions, the initial ~10 to 20 administrations should be performed under appropriate medical supervision. Hypersensitivity reactions may be associated with factor IX inhibitor development; patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for factor IX inhibitors. If severe hypersensitivity reactions occur, consider the use of alternative hemostatic measures (WFH [Srivastava 2013]).</p><p>• Thrombotic events: Thrombotic events (eg, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, thrombotic strokes) as well as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) have occurred. Monitor closely for signs or symptoms of intravascular coagulation or thrombosis; risk is higher in patients with congenital or acquired coagulation disorders, and with repeated dosing or high doses. Use with caution when administering to patients with liver disease, history of coronary artery disease, pre- or postoperatively, neonates, or patients at risk of thromboembolic phenomena, disseminated intravascular coagulation or patients with signs of fibrinolysis due to the potential risk of thromboembolic complications. Discontinue infusion immediately if signs or symptoms of thrombosis or embolism occur.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with extreme caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to the risk of thromboembolic complications.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Heparin: Some products may contain heparin. Use with caution in patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (use of Bebulin is contraindicated).</p><p>• Human plasma: Product of human plasma; may potentially contain infectious agents that could transmit disease. Screening of donors, as well as testing and/or inactivation or removal of certain viruses, reduces the risk. Infections thought to be transmitted by this product should be reported to the manufacturer.</p><p>• Latex: Some product packaging may contain natural rubber latex.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: <b>Factor IX Complex (Human) [Factors II, IX, X] (Bebulin, Profilnine) contains low or nontherapeutic levels of factor VII component </b>and should not be confused with Prothrombin complex concentrate (Human) [(Factors II, VII, IX, X), Protein C, Protein S] (Kcentra, Octaplex) which contains therapeutic levels of factor VII. Factor IX Complex (Human) [Factors II, IX, X] (Bebulin, Profilnine) should not be used for the treatment of factor VII deficiency. When treating warfarin-associated hemorrhage (off-label use), administration of additional fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or factor VIIa should be considered.</p><p>• Clinical response: Response to factor IX administration may vary. If bleeding is not controlled with the recommended dose, determine plasma level of factor IX and follow with a sufficient dose to achieve satisfactory clinical response. If plasma levels of factor IX fail to increase as expected or bleeding continues, suspect the presence of an inhibitor; test as appropriate.</p><p>• Immune tolerance induction: Safety and efficacy have not been established in immune tolerance induction with factor IX products. Nephrotic syndrome has occurred following immune tolerance induction in patients with hemophilia B with factor IX inhibitors receiving factor IX products.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Levels of factor IX; PT, PTT; INR (when used for warfarin reversal); signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions, DIC, thrombosis, especially in patients with liver disease, surgical patients, and patients with known risk factors predisposing to thrombosis</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
C

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Pregnant patients with inherited coagulation disorders may have an increased bleeding risk following abortion, invasive procedures, miscarriage, and delivery; close surveillance is recommended. Clotting factors should be monitored at the first antenatal visit, once or twice during the third trimester, prior to surgical or invasive procedures, and at delivery. Although factor IX levels remain stable during pregnancy, factor IX replacement is recommended if concentrations are &lt;0.5 IU/mL and any of the following occur: need for invasive procedures (including delivery), spontaneous miscarriage, insertion and removal of epidural catheters, or active bleeding. Hemostatic factor IX concentrations should be maintained for at least 3 to 5 days following invasive procedures or postpartum. If replacement with a factor IX concentrate is indicated to increase factor IX during pregnancy, a recombinant product is preferred. In addition, the use of factor IX concentrates that also contain factors II, VII, IX, and X (also known as PCCs) are rarely used; pure factor IX concentrations are preferred (NHF 2017; RCOG [Pavord 2017]; WFH [Srivastava 2013]).</p><p>Factor II concentrations do not increase during pregnancy. In women with severe factor II deficiency, PCCs may be administered if factor II activity is &lt; 0.2 IU/mL with significant bleeding, during labor, or prior to cesarean delivery. Patients treated with PCCs prior to pregnancy may continue use. Factor X concentrations may increase during pregnancy; however, patients with severe factor X deficiency remain at risk for bleeding. In addition, treatment may be needed if concentrations are &lt;0.3 IU/mL at term or prior to procedure. Hemostatic concentrations should be maintained for at least 3 days following procedures or postpartum. PCCs may be used for severe factor X deficiency in pregnancy (RCOG [Pavord 2017]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat hemophilia.</p><p>• It is used to treat or prevent bleeding.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
