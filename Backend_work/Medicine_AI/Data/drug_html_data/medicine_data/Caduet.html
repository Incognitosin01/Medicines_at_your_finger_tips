Atorvastatin is in a group of drugs called HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, or "statins." Atorvastatin reduces levels of "bad" cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) and triglycerides in the blood, while increasing levels of "good" cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL).</p><p>Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker. Amlodipine relaxes the blood vessels, improving blood flow and making it easier for the heart to pump.</p><p>Caduet is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) or chest pain (angina), and to lower the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other heart complications in people with type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, or other risk factors.</p><p>Caduet is used in adults and children who are at least 10 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not Caduet if you have liver disease.</p><p><b>Amlodipine and atorvastatin can harm an unborn baby or cause birth defects. Do not use if you are pregnant.</b> If you become pregnant, stop taking this medicine and tell your doctor right away.</p><p><b>Do not breastfeed while taking Caduet.</b></p><p>Before taking Caduet, tell your doctor if you have ever had liver or kidney disease, heart disease, diabetes, or a thyroid disorder, or if you drink more than 2 alcoholic beverages daily.</p><p>In rare cases, Caduet can cause a condition that results in the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, leading to kidney failure. This condition may be more likely to occur in older adults and in people who have kidney disease or poorly controlled hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).</p><p>Avoid eating foods that are high in fat or cholesterol. Caduet will not be as effective in lowering your cholesterol if you do not follow a cholesterol-lowering diet plan.</p><p>Some medicines can cause unwanted or dangerous effects when used with Caduet.
