In general, vaccination should preferably occur in September and October (in the United States) to ensure optimal immunity prior to onset and for the full duration of influenza activity in the community. Early vaccination (in July or August) for an upcoming influenza season has been associated with suboptimal immunity before the end of an influenza season, particularly in older adults. Vaccination should continue throughout the influenza season as long as vaccine is available. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend revaccination later in the season for those persons who have already been fully vaccinated (CDC/ACIP [Grohskopf 2020]).</p><p><b>Immunization:</b> Intranasal:</p><p><i>US labeling:</i> Adults ≤49 years: 0.2 mL/dose (0.1 mL per nostril) (1 dose per season).</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Adults ≤59 years: 0.2 mL/dose (0.1 mL per nostril) (1 dose per season).</p><p>Not indicated for use in patients ≥50 years (US labeling) or ≥60 years (Canadian labeling).</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Not indicated for use in patients ≥50 years (US labeling) or ≥60 years (Canadian labeling).</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Note: Immunization during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: </b>Routine vaccination should NOT be delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic (CDC 2020; WHO 2020).

Management: Avoid use of live, attenuated vaccines before, during, or after (prior to B-cell recovery) venetoclax treatment.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><h2>Test Interactions</h2><p>Administration of the intranasal influenza virus vaccine (live, LAIV) may cause a positive result on the rapid influenza diagnostic test for the 7 days after vaccine administration; for a person with influenza-like illness during this time, the positive test could be caused by either the live attenuated vaccine or wild-type influenza virus (Ali 2004).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Frequency of events reported within 10 days.</p><p>&gt;10%:</p><p>Central nervous system: Headache (adults: 40%; children: 3% to 9%), irritability (children: 12% to 21%), lethargy (children: 7% to 14%)</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Sore throat (adults: 28%; children: 5% to 11%), decreased appetite (children: 13% to 21%), abdominal pain (children: 2% to 12%)</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Fatigue (adults: ≤26%), weakness (adults: ≤26%), myalgia (adults: 17%; children: 2% to 6%)</p><p>Respiratory: Nasal congestion (children: ≤58%; adults: ≤44%), rhinorrhea (children: ≤58%; adults: ≤44%), cough (adults: 14%)</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Central nervous system: Chills (adults: 9%; children: 2% to 4%)</p><p>Otic: Otitis media (children: 3%)</p><p>Respiratory: Wheezing (children: 6 to 23 months: 6%; 24 to 59 months: 2%), sinusitis (adults: 4%), sneezing (children: 2%)</p><p>Miscellaneous: Fever (children: 100°F to 101°F: 6% to 9%; &gt;101°F: 1% to 4%)</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Anaphylaxis, Bell's palsy, diarrhea, encephalitis (vaccine-associated), epistaxis, exacerbation of asthma, facial edema, Guillain-Barre syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction, meningitis (including eosinophilic meningitis), nausea, pericarditis, skin rash, subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy (Leigh syndrome exacerbation), urticaria, vomiting</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions: Immediate treatment (including epinephrine 1 mg/mL) for anaphylactoid and/or hypersensitivity reactions should be available during vaccine use (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever); vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Asthma/wheezing: Children &lt;24 months of age had increased wheezing and hospitalizations following administration in clinical trials; use of the nasal spray is not approved in this age group. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) considers live influenza virus vaccine (LAIV) contraindicated in adult patients with chronic pulmonary disorders (including asthma) and considers LAIV contraindicated in children 2 to 4 years of age who have had asthma or wheezing episodes within the past year. Use with caution in patients ≥5 years of age who have asthma (CDC/ACIP [Grohskopf 2020]). Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) considers LAIV contraindicated in patients with severe asthma, active wheezing, or wheezing requiring medical attention in the 7 days prior to vaccination (NACI 2020). Risk of wheezing following vaccination is increased in children &lt;5 years of age with a history of recurrent wheezing and in persons of any age with asthma. Patients with severe asthma or active wheezing were not included in clinical trials.</p><p>• Medical conditions predisposing to influenza complications: Safety of LAIV in patients with medical conditions predisposing to influenza complications (eg, chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular [except isolated hypertension], renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders [including diabetes]) has not been established; use with caution (CDC/ACIP [Grohskopf 2020]).</p><p>• Guillain-Barré syndrome: Use with caution in patients with history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS); patients with history of GBS have a greater likelihood of developing GBS than those without. As a precaution, the ACIP recommends that patients with a history of GBS and who are at low risk for severe influenza complications and patients known to have experienced GBS within 6 weeks following previous vaccination should generally not be vaccinated (consider influenza antiviral chemoprophylaxis in these patients). Based on limited data, the benefits of vaccinating persons with a history of GBS who are also at higher risk for severe complications of influenza, may outweigh the risks (CDC/ACIP [Grohskopf 2020]). Recent studies of patients who received the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) or the monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine have shown the risk of GBS is lower with vaccination than with influenza infection (Baxter 2013; Greene 2013; Kwong 2013).</p><p>• Nasal congestion: Use another influenza vaccine or defer immunization with LAIV if nasal congestion is present which may impede delivery of vaccine (CDC/ACIP [Grohskopf 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Oral influenza antiviral medications: LAIV should not be given until 48 hours after the completion of oseltamivir or zanamivir, 5 days after completion of peramivir, or 17 days after completion of baloxavir (CDC/ACIP [Grohskopf 2020]). Influenza antiviral therapy (influenza A and B) should not be administered for 2 weeks after receiving LAIV. If influenza antiviral therapy (influenza A and B) and LAIV are administered concomitantly, revaccination should be considered.</p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist. The ACIP prefers each dose of a specific vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer when possible (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Adults: The safety and efficacy of the nasal spray have not been established in adults ≥50 years of age (US labeling) or ≥60 years of age (Canadian labeling).</p><p>• Pediatric: Due to association of Reye syndrome with aspirin, use of LAIV is contraindicated in pediatric patients on concurrent aspirin therapy; aspirin-containing products should be avoided for 4 weeks following vaccination in children and adolescents ≤17 years of age.</p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Data on the use of LAIV in immunocompromised patients is limited. <b>Avoid contact with severely immunocompromised individuals for at least 7 days following vaccination (at least 14 days per Canadian labeling).</b> ACIP and NACI do not recommend the use of LAIV in immunosuppressed patients, including most patients with HIV (CDC/ACIP [Grohskopf 2020]; NACI 2020). Children and adolescents with HIV who have stable disease, are receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, and have stable immune function may receive LAIV per NACI (NACI 2020). ACIP does not recommend the use of LAIV for persons who care for severely immunocompromised individuals who require a protective environment due to the theoretical risk of transmitting the live virus from the vaccine. Persons who care for the severely immunocompromised should receive either IIV or recombinant influenza vaccine (CDC/ACIP [Grohskopf 2020]). Live vaccines should be administered ≥4 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression and avoided within 2 weeks of immunosuppression when feasible; live vaccines should not be administered for ≥3 months after immunosuppressive therapy (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Arginine: Manufactured using arginine.</p><p>• Chicken egg protein: Manufactured with chicken egg protein. Allergy to eggs must be distinguished from allergy to the vaccine. Recommendations are available from the ACIP and NACI regarding influenza vaccination to persons who report egg allergies; however, ACIP states a prior severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccine, regardless of the component suspected, is a contraindication to vaccination. Per ACIP, patients with a history of egg allergy who have experienced only hives following egg exposure should receive influenza vaccine if otherwise appropriate. Patients with a history of egg allergy other than hives (eg, angioedema, respiratory distress) or who required emergency medical attention (eg, epinephrine) may receive influenza vaccine if otherwise appropriate and administered in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting with health care supervision able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions (CDC/ACIP [Grohskopf 2020]). However, American Academy of Pediatrics; American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology; and NACI state that patients may receive vaccination regardless of severity of egg allergy and no special precautions are required (AAP 2020; Greenhawt 2018; NACI 2020).</p><p>• Gelatin: Manufactured using gelatin.</p><p>• Gentamicin: Manufactured with gentamicin.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Antipyretics: Antipyretics have not been shown to prevent febrile seizures; antipyretics may be used to treat fever or discomfort following vaccination (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). One study reported that routine prophylactic administration of acetaminophen prior to vaccination to prevent fever decreased the immune response of some vaccines; the clinical significance of this reduction in immune response has not been established (Prymula 2009).</p><p>• Appropriate use: The safety of LAIV in individuals with underlying medical conditions that may predispose them to complications following wild-type influenza infection has not been established. Use of this vaccine for specific medical and/or other indications (eg, immunocompromising conditions, hepatic or kidney disease, diabetes) is also addressed in the annual ACIP Recommended Immunization Schedules (refer to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] schedule for detailed information). Specific recommendations for use of this vaccine in immunocompromised patients with asplenia, cancer, HIV infection, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, cochlear implants, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (prior to or after), sickle cell disease, solid organ transplant (prior to or after), or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for chronic conditions as well as contacts of immunocompromised patients are available from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (Rubin 2014).</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval.
