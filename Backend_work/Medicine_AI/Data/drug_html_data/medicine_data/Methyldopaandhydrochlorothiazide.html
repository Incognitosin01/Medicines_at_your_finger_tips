If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.</p><p>Methyldopa works by controlling nerve impulses along certain nerve pathways. As a result, it relaxes blood vessels so that blood passes through them more easily. Hydrochlorothiazide helps reduce the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine. These actions help to lower blood pressure.</p><p>Methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Although there is no specific information comparing use of methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide in children with use in other age groups, it is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Dizziness or light-headedness, drowsiness, or signs of too much potassium loss may be more likely to occur in the elderly, who are more sensitive to the effects of methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><p>Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

Your doctor will tell you which factors are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet.</p><p>Many patients who have high blood pressure will not notice any signs of the problem. In fact, many may feel normal.

Therefore, you must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. <i>You may have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life</i>.

<li>If you are to take a single dose a day, take it in the morning after breakfast.</li>
<li>If you are to take more than one dose a day, take the last dose no later than 6 p.m., unless otherwise directed by your doctor.</li>

Keep from freezing.</p><p>Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide</h2><p>It is important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide is working properly.</p><p><i>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor</i>. This especially includes over-the-counter (nonprescription) medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems, since they may tend to increase your blood pressure.</p><p><i>Methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide may cause a loss of potassium from your body</i>:</p><ul>
<li>To help prevent this, your doctor may want you to:
<ul>
<li>eat or drink foods that have a high potassium content (for example, orange or other citrus fruit juices), or</li>
<li>take a potassium supplement, or</li>
<li>take another medicine to help prevent the loss of the potassium in the first place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is very important to follow these directions. Also, it is important not to change your diet on your own. This is more important if you are already on a special diet (as for diabetes), or if you are taking a potassium supplement or a medicine to reduce potassium loss. Extra potassium may not be necessary and, in some cases, too much potassium could be harmful.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>eat or drink foods that have a high potassium content (for example, orange or other citrus fruit juices), or</li>
<li>take a potassium supplement, or</li>
<li>take another medicine to help prevent the loss of the potassium in the first place.</li>
</ul><p>Check with your doctor if you become sick and have severe or continuing vomiting or diarrhea. These problems may cause you to lose additional water and potassium.</p><p>Before having any kind of surgery (including dental surgery) or emergency treatment, tell the medical doctor or dentist in charge that you are taking methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide.</p><p><i>If you have a fever and there seems to be no reason for it, check with your doctor</i>. This is especially important during the first few weeks you take methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide since fever may be a sign of a serious reaction to methyldopa.</p><p>Methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide may cause some people to become drowsy or less alert than they are normally. This is more likely to happen when you begin to take it or when you increase the amount of medicine you are taking. <i>Make sure you know how you react to methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert</i>.</p><p>Dizziness, light-headedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help, but if the problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.</p><p>The dizziness, light-headedness, or fainting is also more likely to occur if you drink alcohol, stand for long periods of time, exercise, or if the weather is hot. Drinking alcoholic beverages may also make the drowsiness worse. <i>While you are taking methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide, be careful in the amount of alcohol you drink</i>. Also, use extra care during exercise or hot weather or if you must stand for long periods of time.</p><p>For <i>diabetic patients</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide may raise blood sugar levels. While you are using methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide, be especially careful in testing for sugar in your urine. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.</li>
</ul><p>Methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide may cause dryness of the mouth. For temporary relief, use sugarless candy or gum, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. However, if your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your medical doctor or dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.</p><p>Hydrochlorothiazide may cause your skin to be more sensitive to sunlight than it is normally. Exposure to sunlight, even for brief periods of time, may cause a skin rash, itching, redness or other discoloration of the skin, or a severe sunburn. When you begin taking methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide:</p><ul>
<li>Stay out of direct sunlight, especially between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., if possible.</li>
<li>Wear protective clothing, including a hat. Also, wear sunglasses.</li>
<li>Apply a sun block product that has a skin protection factor (SPF) of at least 15. Some patients may require a product with a higher SPF number, especially if they have a fair complexion. If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional.</li>
<li>Apply a sun block lipstick that has an SPF of at least 15 to protect your lips.</li>
<li>Do not use a sunlamp or tanning bed or booth.</li>
</ul><p><i>If you have a severe reaction from the sun, check with your doctor</i></p><p>Before you have any medical tests, tell the doctor in charge that you are taking methyldopa and hydrochlorothiazide.
