</ul><h2>Exall Liquid</h2><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">Antitussive and expectorant actions.</p><p>Carbetapentane Citrate is a centrally acting non-narcotic antitussive. Carbetapentane citrate has atropine-like and local anesthetic actions,<br/>
as well as temporarily controls and suppresses the cough reflex by selective depression of the medullary cough center. It has no significant<br/>
analgesic or sedative properties, does not depress respiration or predispose to addiction with usual doses.</p><p>Guaifenesin has an expectorant action, which increases the output of respiratory tract fluid by reducing adhesiveness and surface tension.<br/>
By increasing respiratory tract fluid, guaifenesin reduces the viscosity of secretions, and facilitates expectoration of retained secretions.<br/>
Guaifenesin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly metabolized and renally excreted. Guaifenesin has a plasma<br/>
half-life of one hour. The major urinary metabolite is beta-(2-methoxyphenoxy) lactic acid. Sinus and bronchial drainage is improved and dry,<br/>
non-productive coughs become more productive and less frequent. Guaifenesin helps loosen phlegm (mucus) and thin bronchial secretions<br/>
to rid the bronchial passageways of bothersome mucus, drain bronchial tubes, and make coughs more productive.<br/></p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First">For temporary relief of productive and non-productive cough accompanying respiratory tract congestion associated with the common<br/>
cold, influenza, sinusitis, and bronchitis.<br/></p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Exall<span class="Sup">TM</span> Liquid is contraindicated in infants and newborns, and in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients<br/>
and in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) therapy, including 14 days after stopping.<br/></p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> Before prescribing any medication to suppress or modify cough, it is important that the underlying cause of the cough is identified.<br/></p><h2>Information for Patients:</h2><p class="First">Patients should be instructed to take Exall<span class="Sup">TM</span> Liquid only as prescribed. Do not exceed the recommended dose. If nervousness,<br/>
dizziness, or sleeplessness occur, discontinue use and consult a physician.<br/></p><h2>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions:</h2><p class="First">Carbetapentane citrate should not be used in patients receiving MAO inhibitors, including 14 days after stopping the MAOI drug.<br/>
The use of carbetapentane citrate may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with alcohol, antihistamines,<br/>
psychotropics or other drugs that produce CNS depression.</p><p>Guaifenesin may produce an increase in urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and may therefore interfere with the interpretation of<br/>
this test for the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome. It may also falsely elevate the VMA test for catechols. Administration of this<br/>
drug should be discontinued 48 hours prior to the collection of urine specimens for such tests.<br/></p><h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility:</h2><p class="First">No adequate and well-controlled studies have been conducted to determine whether the components of Exall<span class="Sup">TM </span> Liquid<br/>
have a potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility.<br/></p><h2>Pregnancy:</h2><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is also not known whether it can<br/>
cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. This product should not be administered<br/>
to pregnant women.<br/></p><h2>Nursing Mothers:</h2><p class="First">Due to the possible passage of the ingredients into breast milk, this product should not be given to nursing mothers.<br/></p><h2>Pediatric use:</h2><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of six have not been established. Product not intended for administration<br/>
for children 6 years of age and under.<br/></p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Adverse effects associated with carbetapentane citrate are rare, but nausea and/or other gastrointestinal disturbances sometimes occur.<br/>
Guaifenesin is well tolerated and has a wide margin of safety. Adverse effects associated with guaifenesin usually result from doses larger<br/>
than those required for expectoration.<br/></p><h2>OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Signs and Symptoms:</span> Overdosage with carbetapentane citrate may produce central excitement and mental confusion. Guaifenesin is<br/>
unlikely to produce toxic effects since its toxicity is low. When laboratory animals were administered guaifenesin in doses up to 5 g/kg<br/>
by stomach tube, no toxicity resulted.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment:</span> The patient should be induced to vomit, even if emesis has occurred spontaneously. Pharmacologic vomiting by the<br/>
administration of ipecac liquid is a preferred method, however, vomiting should not be induced in patients with impaired consciousness.<br/>
Precautions against aspiration must be taken, especially in infants and children. Following emesis, any drug remaining in the stomach<br/>
may be absorbed by activated charcoal administered as a slurry with water.<br/></p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults and children 12 years of age and older:</span><br/>
1-2 teaspoonfuls (5-10 mL) every 4-6 hours, not to exceed 12 teaspoonfuls in a 24 hour period.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Children 6 to 12 years of age:</span><br/>
1 teaspoonful (5 ml) every 4-6 hours, not to exceed 6 teaspoonfuls in a 24 hour period.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Children under 6 years of age:</span><br/>
