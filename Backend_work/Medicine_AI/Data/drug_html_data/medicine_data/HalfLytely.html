Do not take in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label.</p><p>HalfLytely and Bisacodyl comes in a kit containing 2 bisacodyl delayed-release tablets and a bottle of HalfLytely in powder form. You will take the bisacodyl tablets first and then wait to have a bowel movement. Once you have a bowel movement, you will start using the PEG-3350 solution over a period of about 90 minutes.</p><p><b>Bisacodyl delayed-release tablets:</b></p><p>Do not crush, chew, or break the bisacodyl delayed-release tablets. Swallow the bisacodyl tablets whole with a glass of water. Delayed-release tablets are specially made to release medicine slowly in the body. Breaking the pill would cause too much of the drug to be released at one time.</p><p>You should have a bowel movement within 1 to 6 hours after taking the bisacodyl tablets. After your first bowel movement, start using the HalfLytely solution.</p><p><b>HalfLytely solution:</b></p><p>The HalfLytely powder must be mixed with water before you take it. Fill the container with water up to the 2-liter mark. Place the cap on the bottle and shake it until the powder is completely dissolved.</p><p>A variety of flavor packs are provided with the PEG-3350 powder. Use only one pack to add flavor to the solution. You may also prepare the solution without a flavor pack. Do not add any extra flavorings such as sugar, honey, artificial sweetener, fruit juices, or other beverages.</p><p>Shake the liquid well just before you measure each dose. The usual dose of PEG-3350 solution is 8 ounces every 10 minutes. Drink the solution in the exact portions at the exact time intervals prescribed by your doctor.</p><p>Drink each portion as quickly as possible, rather than sipping it slowly. The first watery stool should appear within 1 hour after you start drinking the HalfLytely solution.</p><p>You may store the mixed solution in a refrigerator but you must use it within 48 hours after mixing. Throw away any PEG-3350 solution you have not used within 48 hours after it was mixed.</p><p>PEG-3350 will produce watery diarrhea. Keep drinking the solution until you have consumed all 2 liters.</p><p>On the day of your colonoscopy or bowel exam, do not eat solid food or drink anything other than clear liquids. You may be instructed not to drink or eat anything before your medical test or procedure.
