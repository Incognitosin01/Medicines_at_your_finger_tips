A healthcare provider will apply this medicine in a clinical setting.</p><p>Before this medicine is applied, your skin lesions will be gently scraped to remove any scales or crusting. After Metvixia cream is applied, your caregiver will cover the treatment area with a bandage. You will need to leave this bandage in place for 3 hours.</p><p>During this 3-hour period, avoid exposure to cold temperatures and sunlight or bright indoor lights. Wear a wide-brimmed hat if you must be outdoors during this time.</p><p>After your bandaging is removed, any excess medication will be removed with a saline solution. You will then be ready to receive the light treatment.</p><p>You will be given eye-wear to protect your eyes during red light treatment.</p><p>You may feel a slight stinging or burning during light therapy. Tell your caregivers if you have any type of severe discomfort.</p><p>Metvixia and red light therapy is usually given in two sessions one week apart. Your treatment schedule may be different. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>It may take several weeks before you notice improvement in your skin condition. Your doctor will need to check your treated skin 3 months after the end of your last treatment with Metvixia.</p><p><b>Your skin lesions may need to be treated more than once, and they may come back after treatment.</b> Talk to your doctor about the number of treatments needed to treat your condition.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Keratosis:</b></p><p>Non-hyperkeratotic, nonpigmented actinic keratoses of the face and scalp in immunocompetent patients: Apply directly on lesion(s), up to a total of 1 gram (half tube) per each treatment session. Two sessions one week apart should be administered. Cream application should be followed by photoactivation with Aktilite CL 128 lamp red light illumination.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to application of Metvixia cream, a small dermal curette should be used to remove scales and crusts and to roughen the surface of the lesion(s). An approximately 1 mm-thick layer of cream should be applied with a spatula to each lesion and the surrounding 5 mm of normal skin. The application area should then be covered with an occlusive, nonabsorbent dressing for 3 hours (2.5 to 4 hours). Multiple lesions may be treated during the same session, up to an area of 80 X 180 mm (the area of illumination).<br/>
<br/>
Following removal of the occlusive dressing, clean the area with saline and gauze before beginning Aktilite red light treatment. The light dose to be used is 37 J/cm2, and the lamp should be placed 50 to 80 mm (2 to 3.2 inches) from the skin. The required illumination time (7 to 10 minutes) is calculated automatically. Both the patient and operator should wear appropriate eye protection during illumination and avoid staring into the beam. The illumination stops automatically.<br/>
<br/>
If Aktilite red light treatment is interrupted or stopped for any reason, it may be restarted. If the patient cannot have the red light treatment during the prescribed period after application, the cream should be rinsed off and the patient should protect the exposed area from sunlight and prolonged or intense light for at least 48 hours.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Because Metvixia cream is applied only when needed prior to red light therapy, you will not be on a dosing schedule.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since this medicine is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using Metvixia?</h2><p>Tell your caregivers right away if any of this medicine gets into your eyes, mouth, or nose.</p><p>Avoid touching the treated skin areas after Metvixia cream has been applied to them. Special gloves must be worn by the healthcare provider while applying this medication, and you should not allow your own fingers to come into contact with the cream on your skin.</p><p>For at least 48 hours after your treatment, avoid exposing treated skin to sunlight, sunlamps, tanning beds, or other bright lights. <b>Sunscreen is not effective enough to protect treated skin from harm caused by bright light during this time</b>. Wear protective clothing whenever you are outdoors.</p><p>Even if you do not receive the light therapy portion of your treatment, you must still protect your skin from light for 48 hours after the Metvixia cream was applied.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Metvixia side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have any of these <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Metvixia:</b> hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
