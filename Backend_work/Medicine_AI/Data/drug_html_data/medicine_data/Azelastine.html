Adverse reactions reported include: anaphylaxis, application site irritation, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, confusion, dyspnea, facial edema, involuntary muscle contractions, nasal sores, palpitations, paresthesia, parosmia, pruritus, rash, disturbance or loss of sense of smell and/or taste, tolerance, urinary retention, vision abnormal and xerophthalmia.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Central Nervous System Depressants</h3><p class="First">Concurrent use of Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because reductions in alertness and impairment of central nervous system performance may occur <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> .</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span> </p><p>Limited data from post-marketing experience over decades of use with Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm at oral doses approximately 5 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of Azelastine HCl to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 270 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) of 1.096 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Data</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In an embryo-fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis, Azelastine HCl caused embryo-fetal death, structural abnormalities (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at approximately 300 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) in adults (on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day), which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 15 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day).</p><p>In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, Azelastine HCl caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine HCl caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 610 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 20 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 2 mg/kg/day).</p><p>In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, Azelastine HCl caused abortion, delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day).</p><p>In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21, Azelastine HCl produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 270 times the MRHDID (on mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg/day).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of Azelastine HCl in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.

The safety and effectiveness of Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis have been established for patients 12 years and older <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span> . The safety and effectiveness of Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% in pediatric patients below the age of 5 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis and in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years with vasomotor rhinitis have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There have been no reported overdosages with Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1%. Acute overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse reactions, other than increased somnolence, since one bottle of Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% contains 30 mg of Azelastine(HCl). Clinical trials in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of Azelastine (HCl) (up to 16 mg) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse reactions. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1%. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in young children. Accordingly, Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% should be kept out of the reach of children.</p><h2>Azelastine Description</h2><p class="First">Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1%, 137 micrograms (mcg), is an antihistamine formulated as a metered-spray solution for intranasal administration. Azelastine HCl, USP occurs as a white, almost odorless, crystalline powder with a bitter taste. It has a molecular weight of 418.37. It is sparingly soluble in water, methanol, and propylene glycol and slightly soluble in ethanol, octanol, and glycerine. It has a melting point of about 225°C and the pH of a saturated solution is between 5.0 and 5.4. Its chemical name is (±)-1-(2H)-phthalazinone,4-[(4-chlorophenyl) methyl]-2-(hexahydro-1-methyl-1H-azepin-4-yl)-, monohydrochloride. Its molecular formula is C <span class="Sub">22</span>H <span class="Sub">24</span>ClN <span class="Sub">3</span>O•HCl with the following chemical structure:</p><p>Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% contains 0.1% Azelastine HCl, USP in an aqueous solution at pH 6.8 ± 0.3. It also contains benzalkonium chloride (125 mcg/mL), citric acid, dibasic sodium phosphate, edetate disodium, hypromellose, purified water (pH 6.8) and sodium chloride.</p><p>After priming <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span> , each metered spray delivers a 0.137 mL mean volume containing 137 mcg of Azelastine HCl, USP (equivalent to 125 mcg of Azelastine base). The bottle can deliver 200 metered sprays.</p><h2>Azelastine - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Azelastine HCl, a phthalazinone derivative, exhibits histamine H <span class="Sub">1</span>-receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies. The major metabolite, desmethylAzelastine, also possesses H <span class="Sub">1</span>-receptor antagonist activity.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology:</span></p><p>In a placebo-controlled study (95 subjects with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of Azelastine HCl nasal spray, 0.1% (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of Azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively.</p><p>Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral Azelastine HCl and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. At a dose approximately 8 times the maximum recommended dose, Azelastine HCl does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption:</span> After intranasal administration, the systemic bioavailability of Azelastine HCl is approximately 40%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C <span class="Sub">max</span>) are achieved in 2 to 3 hours.</p><p>Azelastine HCl administered intranasally at doses above two sprays per nostril twice daily for 29 days resulted in greater than proportional increases in C <span class="Sub">max</span> and area under the curve (AUC) for Azelastine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution:</span> Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution is 14.5 L/kg. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of Azelastine and its metabolite, desmethylAzelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism:</span> Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylAzelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of Azelastine have not been identified. After intranasal dosing of Azelastine HCl to steady-state, plasma concentrations of desmethylAzelastine range from 20% to 50% of Azelastine concentrations. Limited data indicate that the metabolite profile is similar when Azelastine HCl is administered via the intranasal or oral route.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination:</span> Based on intravenous and oral administration, the elimination half-life and plasma clearance are 22 hours and 0.5 L/h/kg, respectively. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled Azelastine HCl was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged Azelastine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Populations:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment:</span> Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment:</span> Based on oral, single-dose studies, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min) resulted in a 70% to 75% higher C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC compared to normal subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged.</p><p><span class="Italics">Age:</span> Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gender:</span> Following oral administration, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender.</p><p><span class="Italics">Race:</span> The effect of race has not been evaluated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug-Drug Interactions:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Erythromycin:</span> No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co-administration of orally administered Azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days). In this study, co-administration of orally administered Azelastine with erythromycin resulted in C <span class="Sub">max</span> of 5.36 ± 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 ± 24 ng•h/mL for Azelastine, whereas, administration of Azelastine alone resulted in C <span class="Sub">max</span> of 5.57 ± 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 ± 24 ng•h/mL for Azelastine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cimetidine and Ranitidine:</span> In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean Azelastine (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with co-administration of orally administered Azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily). Oral co-administration of Azelastine with ranitidine resulted in C <span class="Sub">max</span> of 8.89 ±3.28 ng/mL and AUC of 88.22 ± 40.43 ng•h/mL for Azelastine, whereas, Azelastine when administered alone resulted in C <span class="Sub">max</span> of 7.83 ± 4.06 ng/mL and AUC of 80.09 ± 43.55 ng•h/mL for Azelastine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Theophylline:</span> No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the co-administration of an oral 4 mg dose of Azelastine HCl twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Two-year carcinogenicity studies in Crl:CD(SD)BR rats and NMRI mice were conducted to assess the carcinogenic potential of Azelastine HCl. No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg (approximately 270 and 240 times the MRHDID for adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis). No evidence for tumorigenicity was observed in mice at doses up to 25 mg/kg (approximately 110 and 100 times the MRHDID for adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p><p>Azelastine HCl showed no genotoxic effects in the Ames test, DNA repair test, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, or chromosomal aberration test in rat bone marrow.</p><p>There were no effects on male or female fertility and reproductive performance in male and female rats at oral doses up to 30 mg/kg (approximately 270 times the MRHDID in adults on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis). At 68.6 mg/kg (approximately 610 times the MRHDID on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis), the duration of estrous cycles was prolonged and copulatory activity and the number of pregnancies were decreased.
