It is used as an enzyme replacement in adults and children at least 4 years old with Type I Gaucher disease.</p><p>Gaucher disease is a genetic condition in which the body lacks the enzyme needed to break down certain fatty materials (lipids). Lipids can build up in the body, causing symptoms such as easy bruising or bleeding, weakness, anemia, bone or joint pain, enlarged liver or spleen, or weakened bones that are easily fractured.</p><p>Elelyso may improve the condition of the liver, spleen, bones, and blood cells in people with Type I Gaucher disease. However, Elelyso is not a cure for this condition.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Some people receiving a Elelyso injection have had a reaction when the medicine was injected, or up to 3 hours later. Tell your caregivers right away if you have a sudden headache, dizziness, warmth or tingling, chest pain, wheezing, nausea, or a red skin rash.</p><p>Elelyso is not a cure for Gaucher disease.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Elelyso if you are allergic to taliglucerase alfa.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant.

The benefit of treating your disease may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using Elelyso . Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2>How is Elelyso given?</h2><p>Elelyso is injected into a vein through an IV. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>You may be given other medications to help prevent an allergic reaction.
