This disease is caused by the lack of a certain enzyme, glucocerebrosidase, in the body. This enzyme is necessary for the body to use fats correctly, and fats will build up in certain areas of the body if the enzyme is not present. Velaglucerase alfa replaces the missing enzyme to help the body process fats.</p><p>Velaglucerase alfa is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using velaglucerase alfa</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
