</ul><h2>Delos Lotion Description</h2><p class="First">Delos™ (3.5% benzoyl peroxide) lotion is a topical preparation containing benzoyl peroxide, for use in the treatment of acne vulgaris, and patented Novasome encapsulation technology to help provide continuous hydration and moisturization to minimize the appearance of skin dryness. Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent that possesses antibacterial properties and is classified as a keratolytic agent. Benzoyl peroxide (C<span class="Sub">14</span>H O<span class="Sub">4</span>) is represented by the following chemical structure:</p><p>Delos™ (3.5% benzoyl peroxide) lotion contains benzoyl peroxide USP 3.5% as the active ingredient in a formulation consisting of: Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Edetate Disodium, Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Glycerin, Glycine Soya (Soybean) Sterols, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Propylparaben, Purified Water, Sorbitan Olivate, Stearyl Alcohol, Tocopheryl Acetate, and Xanthan Gum.</p><h2>Delos Lotion - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The mechanism of action of benzoyl peroxide is not totally understood but its antibacterial activity against Propionibacterium acnes is thought to be a major mode of action, in addition, patients treated with benzoyl peroxide show a reduction in lipids and free fatty acids, and mild desquamation (drying and peeling activity) with simultaneous reduction in comedones and acne lesions. Little is known about the percutaneous penetration, metabolism, and excretion of benzoyl peroxide, although it has been shown that benzoyl peroxide absorbed by the skin is metabolized to benzoic acid and then excreted as benzoate in the urine. There is no evidence of systemic toxicity caused by benzoyl peroxide in humans.</p><h2>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h2><p class="First">Delos™ (3.5% benzoyl peroxide) lotion is indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">These preparations are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of their components.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">When using this product, avoid unnecessary sun exposure and use a sunscreen. Keep out of reach of children.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">For external use only. If severe irritation develops, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. After reaction clears, treatment may often be resumed with less frequent application. These preparations should not be used in or near the eyes or on mucous membranes.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, lips and mucous membranes. If accidental contact occurs, rinse with water. Contact with any colored material (including hair and fabric) may result in bleaching or discoloration. If excessive irritation develops, discontinue use and consult your physician.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment</h3><p class="First">Data from several studies employing a strain of mice that are highly susceptible to developing cancer suggest that benzoyl peroxide acts as a tumor promoter. The clinical significance of these findings to humans is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide has not been found to be mutagenic (Ames Test) and there are no published data indicating it impairs fertility.</p><h3>Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with benzoyl peroxide. It is not known whether benzoyl peroxide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can effect reproduction capacity. Benzoyl peroxide should be used by a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. There are no available data on the effect of benzoyl peroxide on the later growth, development and functional maturation of the unborn child.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when  benzoyl peroxide is used by a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Allergic contact dermatitis and dryness have been reported with topical benzoyl peroxide therapy.</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">If excessive scaling, erythema or edema occurs, the use of these preparations should be discontinued. To hasten resolution of the adverse effects, cool compresses may be used. After symptoms and signs subside, a reduced dosage schedule may be cautiously tried if the reaction is judged to be due to excessive use and not allergenicity.</p><h2>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">Apply Delos™ (3.5% benzoyl peroxide) lotion once or twice daily to cover affected areas, or as directed by your physician. Use after washing with a mild cleanser and water.</p><h2>How is Delos Lotion Supplied</h2><p class="First">Delos™ (3.5% benzoyl peroxide) lotion is available in 45 g tube (NDC 49908-121-45).</p><p>Store at controlled room temperature: 15° - 30° C (59° - 86° F).</p><p>Manufactured for:<br/>
