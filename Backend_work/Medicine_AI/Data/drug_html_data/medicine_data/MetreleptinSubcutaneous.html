The consequences are not well characterized but could include inhibition of endogenous leptin action and/or loss of metreleptin efficacy. Severe infection and/or worsening metabolic control have been reported. Test for anti-metreleptin antibodies with neutralizing activity in patients who develop severe infections or show signs suspicious for loss of metreleptin efficacy during treatment. T-cell lymphoma has been reported in patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy, both treated and not treated with metreleptin. Carefully consider the benefits and risks of treatment with metreleptin in patients with significant hematologic abnormalities and/or acquired generalized lipodystrophy.

Talk to your doctor if you or your child have concerns about this risk.</p><p>Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) may occur when metreleptin is used together with insulin or a diabetes medicine. Symptoms of low blood sugar must be treated before they lead to unconsciousness (passing out). Different people may feel different symptoms of low blood sugar.
