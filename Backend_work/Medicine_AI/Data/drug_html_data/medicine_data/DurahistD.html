Histamine can produce symptoms of sneezing, itching, watery eyes, and runny nose. Methscopolamine reduces secretion of fluids in the body that cause sneezing, runny nose, and postnasal drip. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages. Dilated blood vessels can cause nasal congestion (stuffy nose).</p><p>Durahist D is used to treat runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, watery eyes, and sinus congestion caused by allergies, the common cold, or the flu.</p><p>Durahist D may also be used for purposes not listed here.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Do not take Durahist D if you have used a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as furazolidone (Furoxone), isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), rasagiline (Azilect), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar), or tranylcypromine (Parnate) in the last 14 days. A dangerous drug interaction could occur, leading to serious side effects.</p><p>Drinking alcohol can increase certain side effects of Durahist D. Before using this medication, tell your doctor if you regularly use other medicines that make you sleepy (such as cold or allergy medicine, sedatives, narcotic pain medicine, sleeping pills, muscle relaxers, and medicine for seizures, depression, or anxiety). They can add to sleepiness caused by methscopolamine.</p><p>Ask a doctor or pharmacist before using any other cold or allergy medicine when you also taking Durahist D. Antihistamines and decongestants are contained in many combination medicines. Taking certain products together can cause you to get too much of a certain drug. Check the label to see if a medicine contains an antihistamine or decongestant.</p><p>Avoid taking diet pills, caffeine pills, or other stimulants (such as ADHD medications) without your doctor's advice. Taking a stimulant together with the decongestant found in Durahist D can increase your risk of unpleasant side effects.</p><p>Do not take Durahist D for longer than 7 days in a row. If your symptoms do not improve, or if they get worse and you also have a fever, talk to your doctor.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Durahist D if you are allergic to dexchlorpheniramine, methscopolamine, or pseudoephedrine.
