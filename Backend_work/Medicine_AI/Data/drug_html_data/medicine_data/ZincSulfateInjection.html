<li>
<p class="First">Zinc Sulfate Injection provides 1 mg/mL, 3 mg/mL or 5 mg/mL of zinc.</p>
</li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Zinc Sulfate Injection in a concentration of 1 mg/mL is recommended for use in pediatric patients, particularly those weighing less than 12 kg.</span></li>
<li>
<p class="First">The dosage of Zinc Sulfate Injection should be individualized based on the patient’s clinical condition, nutritional requirements, and the contribution of oral or enteral zinc intake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p class="First">Zinc Sulfate Injection provides 1 mg/mL, 3 mg/mL or 5 mg/mL of zinc.</p><p class="First">The dosage of Zinc Sulfate Injection should be individualized based on the patient’s clinical condition, nutritional requirements, and the contribution of oral or enteral zinc intake.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The recommended adult dosage is 3 mg/day for metabolically stable patients, with potential need for a higher daily dosage in monitored patients with small bowel fluid loss or excess stool or ileostomy output.</p><p><span class="Bold"><br/>
Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>The recommended pediatric dosage is shown in Table 1 by age and estimated weight. The dosages in Table 1 are general recommendations intended for most pediatric patients.  However, based on clinical requirements, some patients may require a higher dosage.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1:  Recommended Dosage of Zinc Sulfate Injection for Pediatric Patients by Age and Estimated Weight<br/></span></p><p>*Term neonates have higher requirements in the first 3 months of life<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Monitoring</span></p><p>Monitor zinc concentrations during treatment.  Also monitor patients clinically for signs and symptoms of zinc deficiency, especially in pediatrics.  Zinc concentrations may vary depending on the assay used and the laboratory reference range.  The collection, processing, and storage of the blood samples for zinc analysis should be performed according to the laboratory’s sample requirements.  Zinc concentrations in hemolyzed samples are falsely elevated due to release of zinc from erythrocytes.  The lower end of the reported range in healthy adults in serum is 60 mcg/dL<br/></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Zinc Sulfate Injection, USP:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>10 mg/10 mL (1 mg/mL) of zinc as a clear, colorless solution in a 10 mL Pharmacy Bulk Package vial.</li>
<li>30 mg/10 mL (3 mg/mL) of zinc as a clear, colorless solution in a 10 mL Pharmacy Bulk Package vial.</li>
<li>25 mg/5 mL (5 mg/mL) of zinc as a clear, colorless solution in a 5 mL Pharmacy Bulk Package vial.</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Zinc Sulfate Injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to zinc <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>5.1 Pulmonary Embolism due to Pulmonary Vascular Precipitates</h3><p class="First">Pulmonary vascular precipitates causing pulmonary vascular emboli and pulmonary distress have been reported in patients receiving parenteral nutrition. The cause of precipitate formation has not been determined in all cases; however, in some fatal cases, pulmonary emboli occurred as a result of calcium phosphate precipitates.  Precipitation has occurred following passage through an in-line filter; in vivo precipitate formation may also have occurred. If signs of pulmonary distress occur, stop the parenteral nutrition infusion and initiate a medical evaluation. In addition to inspection of the solution <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]</span>, the infusion set and catheter should also periodically be checked for precipitates.</p><h3>5.2 Vein Damage and Thrombosis</h3><p class="First">Zinc Sulfate Injection has a low pH and must be prepared and used as an admixture in parenteral nutrition solutions. It is not for direct intravenous infusion.</p><p>In addition, consider the osmolarity of the final parenteral nutrition solution in determining peripheral versus central administration.  Solutions with an osmolarity of 900 mOsmol/L or greater must be infused through a central catheter <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>. The infusion of hypertonic nutrient solutions into a peripheral vein may result in vein irritation, vein damage, and/or thrombosis. The primary complication of peripheral access is venous thrombophlebitis, which manifests as pain, erythema, tenderness or a palpable cord. Remove the catheter as soon as possible, if thrombophlebitis develops.</p><h3>5.3 Aluminum Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Zinc Sulfate Injection contains aluminum that may be toxic. </p><p>Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Preterm infants are particularly at risk for aluminum toxicity because the kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which also contain aluminum.</p><p>Patients with impaired kidney function, including preterm infants, who receive greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day of parenteral aluminum can accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity.  Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.</p><p>Exposure to aluminum from Zinc Sulfate Injection is not more than 0.6 mcg/kg/day. When prescribing Zinc Sulfate Injection for use in parenteral nutrition containing other small volume parenteral products, the total daily patient exposure to aluminum from the admixture should be considered and maintained at no more than 5 mcg/kg/day <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><h3>5.4 Monitoring and Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Monitor zinc concentrations, fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count and coagulation parameters throughout treatment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><h3>5.5 Copper Deficiency</h3><p class="First">Several post-marketing cases have reported that high doses of supplemental zinc (approximately 10 times the recommended dosage of 3 mg/day Zinc Sulfate Injection in adults) taken over extended periods of time (i.e., months to years) may result in decreased enteral copper absorption and copper deficiency. The cases reported the following complications of copper deficiency: anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, myeloneuropathy, and nephrotic-range proteinuria <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>. </p><p>If a patient develops signs and symptoms of copper deficiency during treatment with Zinc Sulfate Injection, interrupt zinc treatment and check zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin levels. Copper deficiency should be treated with supplemental copper administration and discontinuation of zinc supplementation.</p><h3>5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions to subcutaneously administered zinc-containing insulin products were identified in postmarketing case reports. Reported reactions included injection site induration, erythema, pruritus, papular rash, generalized urticaria, facial swelling, and dyspnea. Patients did not manifest symptoms after changing to zinc-free insulin or another insulin product with a reduced amount of zinc.  In some cases, allergy testing confirmed the allergy to the zinc component of the insulin product.  If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Zinc Sulfate Injection and initiate appropriate medical treatment <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">No zinc-related adverse reactions have been reported in clinical studies or post-marketing reports in patients receiving intravenously administered parenteral nutrition solutions containing zinc sulfate within the recommended dosage range. </p><p>The following were identified in clinical studies or post-marketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse reactions with other components of parenteral nutrition solutions:</span></p><ul class="Disc">

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with intravenous zinc sulfate. </p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown.  All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes.  In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk</span></p><p>Deficiency of trace elements, including zinc, is associated with adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes. Pregnant women have an increased metabolic demand for trace elements, including zinc.  Parenteral nutrition with zinc should be considered if a pregnant woman’s nutritional requirements cannot be fulfilled by oral or enteral intake.</p><h3>8.2 Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Zinc is present in human milk. Administration of the approved recommended dose of Zinc Sulfate Injection in parenteral nutrition is not expected to cause harm to a breastfed infant. There is no information on the effects of zinc sulfate on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Zinc Sulfate Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Zinc Sulfate Injection or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>8.4 Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Zinc Sulfate Injection is approved for use in the pediatric population, including neonates, as a source of zinc for parenteral nutrition when oral or enteral nutrition is not possible, insufficient, or contraindicated. Safety and dosing recommendations in pediatric patients are based on published literature describing controlled studies of zinc-containing products in pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><p>Because of immature renal function, preterm infants receiving prolonged parenteral nutrition treatment with Zinc Sulfate Injection may be at higher risk of aluminum toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h3>8.5 Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Reported clinical experience with intravenous zinc sulfate has not identified a difference in zinc requirements between elderly and younger patients.  In general, dose selection should be individualized based on the patient’s clinical condition, nutritional requirements, and additional nutritional intake provided orally or enterally to the patient.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There are reported cases of overdosage with intravenous zinc in parenteral nutrition:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Seven adult patients received an inadvertent overdosage of 50 mg to 75 mg elemental zinc per day in parenteral nutrition solution for 26 to 60 days; 6 of the 7 patients developed hyperamylasemia (peak amylase values of 557 to 1850 Klein units; normal: 130 to 310).  Amylase was not reported in one patient.  Serum zinc concentrations ranged from 310 to 670 mcg/dL.  None of the patients developed clinical signs of pancreatitis.  Five of the 7 patients died of septic complications.</li>
<li>One adult patient died of infectious complications after receiving an inadvertent overdosage of 7.4 grams of zinc sulfate (equivalent to 1.2 grams of elemental zinc per day for 2.5 days) in parenteral nutrition solution over 60 hours.  The serum zinc concentration was 4184 mcg/dL.  Symptoms of zinc overdosage also included hyperamylasemia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, vomiting and diarrhea.</li>
<li>One preterm infant born at 26 weeks gestation died of cardiac failure following a medication error in which the parenteral nutrition solution contained 330 mg/100 mL instead of 330 mcg/100 mL of zinc sulfate (overdosage of 1000-fold)</li>

</p><h2>Zinc Sulfate Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Zinc is an essential trace element.  Zinc functions as a cofactor of various enzymes including DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases, alcohol dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatases.  Zinc is a coordinator of protein structural folding, such as folding of “Zinc finger” motif that interacts with a variety of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.  In addition, zinc is a catalyst of essential biochemical reactions, including activation of substrates of carbonic anhydrase in erythrocyte.  Also, zinc is a signaling mediator modulating multiple signaling pathways.</p><h3>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Zinc sulfate exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic responses are unknown.</p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Over 85% of total body zinc is found in skeletal muscle and bone.  Other organs containing zinc are the liver, kidney, skin, brain, and heart.  In blood, zinc is mainly localized within erythrocytes.  Approximately 80% of serum zinc is bound to albumin and the remainder to alpha2-macroglobulin and amino acids.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>In adults, zinc is primarily excreted via the gastrointestinal tract and eliminated in the feces.</p><p>A smaller amount of zinc is excreted via the kidneys in the urine.  Urinary zinc excretion rates in very low birth weight preterm infants are relatively high in the neonatal period, and they decline to a level on a body weight basis that is similar to that of normal adults by two months of age.  Additionally, endogenous zinc loss occurs from hair, skin desquamation and sweat.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING</h2><p class="First">Zinc Sulfate Injection, USP is a clear, colorless solution supplied as:</p><ul class="Disk">
