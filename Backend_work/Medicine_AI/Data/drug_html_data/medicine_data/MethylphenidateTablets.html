</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride, other methylphenidate-containing products, and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)]</span>.</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Methylphenidate Tablets</h2><p class="First">Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the treatment of:</p><ul>
<li>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders (ADHD) in pediatric patients 6 years and older and adults</li>
<li>Narcolepsy</li>
</ul><h2>Methylphenidate Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Pretreatment Screening</h3><p class="First">Prior to treating pediatric patients and adults with central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride, assess for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history including family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical examination) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p>Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy. Maintain careful prescription records, educate patients about abuse, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and periodically reevaluate the need for methylphenidate hydrochloride use <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]</span>.</p><h3>General Dosing Information</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Tablets</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients 6 years and Older</span>: Start with 5 mg orally twice daily (before breakfast and lunch). Increase dosage gradually, in increments of 5 to 10 mg weekly. Daily dosage above 60 mg is not recommended.</p><p><span class="Italics">Adults</span>: Average dosage is 20 to 30 mg daily. Administer orally in divided doses 2 or 3 times daily, preferably 30 to 45 minutes before meals. Maximum total daily dosage is 60 mg. Patients who are unable to sleep if medication is taken late in the day should take the last dose before 6 p.m.</p><h3>Dose Reduction and Discontinuation</h3><p class="First">If paradoxical worsening of symptoms or other adverse reactions occur, reduce the dosage, or, if necessary, discontinue methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets. If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over a one-month period, the drug should be discontinued.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tablets</span></p><ul>

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Potential for Abuse and Dependence</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride, other methylphenidate-containing products, and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Serious Cardiovascular Reactions</h3><p class="First">Sudden death, stroke and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults with CNS stimulant treatment at recommended doses. Sudden death has been reported in pediatric patients with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, and other serious heart problems. Further evaluate patients who develop exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or arrhythmias during methylphenidate hydrochloride treatment.</p><h3>Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase approximately 2 to 4 mmHg) and heart rate (mean increase approximately 3 to 6 bpm). Individuals may have larger increases. Monitor all patients for hypertension and tachycardia.</p><h3>Psychiatric Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Exacerbation of Preexisting Psychosis</span></p><p>CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a preexisting psychotic disorder.</p><p><span class="Bold">Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder</span></p><p>CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed mood episode in patients. Prior to initiating treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, or depression).</p><p><span class="Bold">New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms</span></p><p>CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing methylphenidate hydrochloride. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients, compared to 0 in placebo-treated patients.</p><h3>Priapism</h3><p class="First">Prolonged and painful erections, sometimes requiring surgical intervention, have been reported with methylphenidate products in both pediatric and adult patients. Priapism was not reported with drug initiation but developed after some time on the drug, often subsequent to an increase in dose. Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal (drug holidays or during discontinuation). Patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections should seek immediate medical attention.</p><h3>Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s Phenomenon</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon, were observed in postmarketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.</p><h3>Long-Term Suppression of Growth</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients.</p><p>Careful follow-up of weight and height in pediatric patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated patients over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated pediatric patients (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development.</p><p>Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants including methylphenidate hydrochloride. Patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul>

Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for ADHD Medications at 1-866-961-2388 or visit https://womensmentalhealth.org/adhd-medications/</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Published studies and postmarketing reports on methylphenidate use during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There may be risks to the fetus associated with the use of CNS stimulants use during pregnancy <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations).</span></p><p>No effects on morphological development were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of methylphenidate to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 10 and 15 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis. However, spina bifida was observed in rabbits at a dose 52 times the MRHD given to adolescents. A decrease in pup body weight was observed in a pre- and post-natal development study with oral administration of methylphenidate to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses 6 times the MRHD given to adolescents <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span></p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>CNS stimulants, such as methylphenidate hydrochloride, can cause vasoconstriction and thereby decrease placental perfusion. No fetal and/or neonatal adverse reactions have been reported with the use of therapeutic doses of methylphenidate during pregnancy; however, premature delivery and low birth weight infants have been reported in amphetamine-dependent mothers.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In embryo-fetal development studies conducted in rats and rabbits, methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 75 and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis. Malformations (increased incidence of fetal spina bifida) were observed in rabbits at the highest dose, which is approximately 52 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The no effect level for embryo-fetal development in rabbits was 60 mg/kg/day (15times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis). There was no evidence of morphological development effects in rats, although increased incidences of fetal skeletal variations were seen at the highest dose level (10 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis), which was also maternally toxic. The no effect level for embryo-fetal development in rats was 25 mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis). When methylphenidate was administered to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses of up to 45 mg/kg/day, offspring body weight gain was decreased at the highest dose (6 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis), but no other effects on postnatal development were observed. The no effect level for pre- and postnatal development in rats was 15 mg/kg/day (~2 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Limited published literature, based on milk sampling from seven mothers reports that methylphenidate is present in human milk, which resulted in infant doses of 0.16% to 0.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 1.1 and 2.7. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. Long-term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from stimulant exposure are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Monitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as agitation, insomnia, anorexia, and reduced weight gain.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets for the treatment of ADHD have been established in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of methylphenidate hydrochloride in pediatric patients less than 6 years have not been established.</p><p>The long-term efficacy of methylphenidate hydrochloride in pediatric patients has not been established.</p><p><span class="Bold">Long-Term Suppression of Growth</span></p><p>Growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data</span></p><p>Rats treated with methylphenidate early in the postnatal period through sexual maturation demonstrated a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity in adulthood. A deficit in acquisition of a specific learning task was observed in females only. The doses at which these findings were observed are at least 4 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><p>In a study conducted in young rats, methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day for 9 weeks, starting early in the postnatal period (postnatal Day 7) and continuing through sexual maturity (postnatal Week 10). When these animals were tested as adults (postnatal Weeks 13 to 14), decreased spontaneous locomotor activity was observed in males and females previously treated with 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis) or greater, and a deficit in the acquisition of a specific learning task was seen in females exposed to the highest dose (8 times the MRHD given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis). The no effect level for juvenile neurobehavioral development in rats was 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the MRHD given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis). The clinical significance of the long-term behavioral effects observed in rats is unknown.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate hydrochloride has not been studied in the geriatric population.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate hydrochloride contain methylphenidate hydrochloride, a Schedule II controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride, have a high potential for abuse. Abuse is characterized by impaired control over drug use despite harm, and craving.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of CNS stimulant abuse include increased heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and/or sweating, dilated pupils, hyperactivity, restlessness, insomnia, decreased appetite, loss of coordination, tremors, flushed skin, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed. Abusers of CNS stimulants may chew, snort, inject, or use other unapproved routes of administration which may result in overdose and death <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><p>To reduce the abuse of CNS stimulants including methylphenidate hydrochloride, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, keep careful prescription records, educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal of CNS stimulants <span class="Italics">[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]</span>, monitor for signs of abuse while on therapy, and reevaluate the need for methylphenidate hydrochloride use.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tolerance</span></p><p>Tolerance (a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug results in a reduction of the drug’s desired and/or undesired effects over time) can occur during chronic therapy with CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dependence</span></p><p>Physical dependence (which is manifested by a withdrawal syndrome produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, or administration of an antagonist) may occur in patients treated with CNS stimulants including methylphenidate hydrochloride. Withdrawal symptoms after abrupt cessation following prolonged high-dosage administration of CNS stimulants include dysphoric mood; fatigue; vivid, unpleasant dreams; insomnia or hypersomnia; increased appetite; and psychomotor retardation or agitation.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Human Experience</span></p><p>Signs and symptoms of acute overdosage, resulting principally from overstimulation of the central nervous system and from excessive sympathomimetic effects, may include the following: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, restlessness, anxiety, agitation, tremors, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, convulsions (which may be followed by coma), euphoria, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, sweating, flushing, headache, hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, hypotension, tachypnea, mydriasis, dryness of mucous membranes, and rhabdomyolysis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Overdose Management</span></p><p>Consult with a Certified Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) for the latest recommendations.</p><h2>Methylphenidate Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, USP contains methylphenidate hydrochloride, a CNS stimulant. It is available as tablets of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg strength for oral administration.</p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride is methyl α-phenyl-2-piperidineacetate hydrochloride, and its structural formula is:</p><p></p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride USP is a white, odorless, fine crystalline powder. Its solutions are acid to litmus. It is freely soluble in water and in methanol, soluble in alcohol, and slightly soluble in chloroform and in acetone. Its molecular weight is 269.77 g/mol.</p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, USP contains the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose.</p><h2>Methylphenidate Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate hydrochloride is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. The mode of therapeutic action in ADHD and narcolepsy is not known.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the <span class="Italics">d-</span> and <span class="Italics">l-threo</span> enantiomers. The <span class="Italics">d-threo</span> enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the l-threo enantiomer. Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>A formal QT study has not been conducted in patients taking methylphenidate hydrochloride.</p><p>The effect of dexmethylphenidate, the pharmacologically active d-enantiomer of methylphenidate hydrochloride, on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- and open-label active (moxifloxacin)-controlled study following single doses of dexmethlyphenidate XR 40 mg (maximum recommended adult total daily dosage) in 75 healthy volunteers. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected up to 12 hours postdose. Frederica’s method for heart rate correction was employed to derive the corrected QT interval (QTcF). The maximum mean prolongation of QTcF intervals was less than 5 ms, and the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval (CI) was below 10 ms for all time-matched comparisons versus placebo. This was below the threshold of clinical concern and there was no evident exposure response relationship.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride in the extended release tablets is more slowly but as extensively absorbed as in the regular tablets. Relative bioavailability of the extended release tablet compared to the methylphenidate hydrochloride tablet, measured by the urinary excretion of methylphenidate hydrochloride major metabolite (α-phenyl-2-piperidine acetic acid) was 105% (49% to 168%) in children and 101% (85% to 152%) in adults. The time to peak rate in children was 1.9 hours (0.3 to 4.4 hours) for the methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets and 4.7 hours (1.3 to 8.2 hours) for the methylphenidate hydrochloride extended release tablets. An average of 67% of extended release tablet dose was excreted in children as compared to 86% in adults.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Food</span></p><p>After a high-fat meal, both area under the curve (AUC) (by 25 %) and C <span class="Sub">max</span> (by 27 %) are higher. Time to C <span class="Sub">max</span> (T <span class="Sub">max</span>) is faster after a high-fat meal (median T <span class="Sub">max</span>: 2.5 hours) as compared to without food (median T <span class="Sub">max</span>: 3 hours).</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Binding to plasma proteins is low (10% to 33%). The volume of distribution was 2.65 ± 1.11 L/kg for d-methylphenidate and 1.80 ± 0.91 L/kg for l-methylphenidate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>The systemic clearance is 0.40 ± 0.12 L/h/kg for d-methylphenidate and 0.73 ± 0.28 L/h/kg for l-methylphenidate.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Methylphenidate is metabolized primarily by de-esterification to alpha-phenyl-piperidine acetic acid (ritalinic acid), which has little or no pharmacologic activity.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>After oral administration, 78% to 97% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 1% to 3% in feces in the form of metabolites within 48 to 96 hours. Most of the dose is excreted in the urine as alpha-phenyl-2-piperidine acetic acid (60% to 86%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Studies in Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Male and Female Patients</span></p><p>In a clinical study involving adult subjects who received methylphenidate hydrochloride extended release tablets, plasma concentrations of methylphenidate hydrochloride major metabolite appeared to be greater in females than in males. No gender differences were observed for methylphenidate hydrochloride plasma concentration in the same subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Racial or Ethnic Groups</span></p><p>There is insufficient experience with the use of methylphenidate hydrochloride to detect ethnic variations in pharmacokinetics.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride has not been studied in renally-impaired patients. Renal impairment is expected to have minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate since less than 1% of a radiolabeled dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged compound, and the major metabolite (ritalinic acid), has little or no pharmacologic activity.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is expected to have minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate since it is metabolized primarily to ritalinic acid by nonmicrosomal hydrolytic esterases that are widely distributed throughout the body.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>In a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in B6C3F1 mice, methylphenidate caused an increase in hepatocellular adenomas, and in males only, an increase in hepatoblastomas at a daily dose of approximately 60 mg/kg/day.

There was no increase in total malignant hepatic tumors. The mouse strain used is sensitive to the development of hepatic tumors and the significance of these results to humans is unknown.</p><p>Methylphenidate did not cause any increase in tumors in a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in F344 rats; the highest dose used was approximately 45 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 4 times the MRHD (children) on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><p>In a 24-week carcinogenicity study in the transgenic mouse strain p53+/-, which is sensitive to genotoxic carcinogens, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity. Male and female mice were fed diets containing the same concentration of methylphenidate as in the lifetime carcinogenicity study; the high-dose groups were exposed to 60 to 74 mg/kg/day of methylphenidate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Methylphenidate was not mutagenic in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ames reverse mutation assay, in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, or in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration assay using human lymphocytes.
