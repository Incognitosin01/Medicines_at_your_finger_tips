Experiments have identified antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the bergamot flavonoids, while applications in cancer and antimicrobial activity are being investigated. See also Bergamot Oil monograph.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p><i>Cognitive dysfunction:</i> An open-label pilot study examined the effect of bergamot-derived polyphenolic fraction (500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks as adjunctive therapy), on cognitive dysfunction in patients being treated for schizophrenia.</p><p><i>Dyslipidemia:</i> Effects of bergamot-derived polyphenolic fraction on dyslipidemia have been studied at dosages of 500 mg/day and 1,000 mg/day for treatment durations of 1 month or 6 months. In a study of patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia, a standardized bergamot-derived extract (Bergavit) was given at a fixed daily dose (150 mg of flavonoids) for 6 months.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Contraindications have not been identified.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Lactation</h3><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>Case reports are lacking. The potential for interactions, similar to the enzyme-inhibiting mechanism of grapefruit, exists.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>Limited clinical studies in hyperlipidemia suggest bergamot juice is safe and well tolerated, although heartburn has been reported. The juice itself is bitter and unpalatable.</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>No data.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Rutaceae (rue or citrus); subfamily Esperidea</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>The bergamot, a small tree native to tropical Asia, is cultivated extensively in Reggio Calabria, a coastal city in southern Italy, and is cultivated on a smaller scale on the Ivory Coast and in Argentina and Brazil. The trees have star-shaped white flowers with round, yellow fruits and large, dark-green, oval-shaped leaves similar to those of lemon trees. The peel of the fresh, nearly ripe fruit is the source of bergamot oil,Navarra 2015 while bergamot juice is derived from the membranous endo and mesocarp of the fruit.Giglio 2016, Mannucci 2017</p><p>Bergamot is related to bitter orange (Citrus aurantium); a synonym of C. bergamia is C. aurantium L. subspecies bergamia.Khan 2009, USDA 2017 C. bergamia should not be confused with scarlet bergamot (Monarda didyma L.) or wild bergamot (Monarda fistulosa L.), which belong to the mint family.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Bergamot oil is used as a citrus flavor and is often added to perfumes and cosmetics. Bergamot oil is used to flavor Earl Grey teaVerzera 2003 and halva, a Middle Eastern sesame paste confection.</p><p>Bergamot juice has recently come into scientific favor, with bergamot-derived flavonoid extract being used in clinical studies. The fresh juice itself is bitter and largely unpalatable, but is available as a liqueur. Ethnobotanical reports suggest bergamot juice may have been used traditionally to treat malaria.Tagarelli 2010</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Bergamot juice and bergamot-derived standardized preparations are characterized by the flavonoids and flavonoid glycoside content, which are distinct from other citrus fruits. Flavonoids neoeriocitrin, naringin, and neohesperidin have been identified, as well as C-glucosides, flavone and flavonone glycosides (rutin, neodiosmin, rhoifolin, and poncirin), and furanocoumarins.Gardana 2008, Mannucci 2017, Picerno 2011, Russo 2015, Salerno 2016, Toth 2016</p><p>Flavonoids brutieridin and melitidin appear to be structural analogues of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which may provide a rationale for the observed hypolipemic properties of bergamot.Giglio 2016, Leopoldini 2010, Mannucci 2017</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>The uses described in the following sections focus on bergamot juice specifically. See also Bergamot Oil monograph for further information regarding potential uses of C. bergamia.</p><h3>Anti-inflammatory effects</h3><p>Reduced release of proinflammatory mediators has been reported, and reduced inflammation in mouse models of colitis and in an intestinal injury/reperfusion model has been demonstrated.Impellizzeri 2015, Impellizzeri 2016, Risitano 2014, Russo 2015, Spigoni 2017</p><h3>Antimicrobial effects</h3><p>The anti-Helicobacter pylori effect of bergamot juice has been demonstrated in clinical isolates. Synergism with antibiotics was also demonstrated.Cirmi 2016, Filocamo 2015</p><h3>Antioxidant effects</h3><p>Bergamot juice flavonoids have been shown to exert antioxidant action in various experiments. Reduced generation of reactive oxygen species and membrane lipid peroxidation, improved mitochondrial functionality, and prevention of DNA oxidative damage have been reported.DaPozzo 2018, Ferlazzo 2015, Ferlazzo 2016 Antioxidant activity may be responsible for the decreased renal injury noted in a study of hypercholesterolemic rodents.Trovato 2010</p><h3>Cancer effects</h3><p>In vitro studies have shown bergamot juice possesses antiproliferative activity.Delle Monache 2013, Ferlazzo 2016, Navarra 2014, Visalli 2014</p><h3>CNS effects</h3><p>Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of bergamot juice have been demonstrated, which may contribute to observed CNS effects.Picerno 2011, Russo 2015</p><p>Findings from animal models of degenerative CNS diseases suggest the flavonoids naringin and neohesperidin may attenuate cognitive impairment.Bruno 2017</p><p>A small, open-label pilot study examined the effect of a bergamot-derived polyphenolic fraction (500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks as adjunctive therapy) on cognitive dysfunction in 20 outpatient-managed subjects being treated for schizophrenia. Improvements from baseline measures were reported for Wisconsin Card Sorting Test perseverative errors (<i>P</i>=0.004) and semantic fluency test (<i>P</i>=0.004).Bruno 2017</p><h3>Dyslipidemia</h3><p>A review of studies, conducted primarily in rats, has been published.Giglio 2016 Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol biosynthesis, increases in fecal neutral sterols and total bile acids excretion, and antioxidant effects have been proposed as mechanisms of action.Giglio 2016, Leopoldini 2010, Mollace 2011, Parafati 2015 Additionally, increased lipolysis and decreased adipocyte generation were shown to be caused by influences on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) levels.Lo Furno 2016</p><p>Limited clinical studies have evaluated the effects of bergamot juice or its extract on dyslipidemia.Giglio 2016, Mannucci 2017 Results from ongoing clinical trials are pending.Giglio 2016</p><p>In an open-label clinical study in 80 patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia, a standardized bergamot-derived extract (Bergavit) was given at a fixed daily dose (150 mg of flavonoids, with 16% neoeriocitrin, 47% neohesperidin, and 37% naringin) for 6 months. The extract increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and decreased total plasma cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides over baseline levels.Toth 2016</p><p>A larger (N=237), double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the effect of bergamot-derived polyphenolic fraction (500 mg/day and 1,000 mg/day) among adults with hyperlipemia. Total and LDL-C and triglyceride levels were reduced, with a consequent increase in HDL. Another group of patients who had discontinued statin therapy due to adverse effects received the bergamot extract at a dosage of 1,500 mg/day; treatment in this group resulted in reductions in total cholesterol and LDL-C.Mollace 2011 Reductions in blood glucose were also reported in patients with metabolic syndrome.Giglio 2016, Mollace 2011</p><p>An open-label study (N=77) evaluated the effects of bergamot-derived polyphenolic fraction (either alone or as adjunctive therapy) on dyslipidemia. Addition of the bergamot preparation (1,000 mg orally daily) to therapy with rosuvastatin (10 mg daily) for 30 days (n=15) enhanced the efficacy of rosuvastatin.Gliozzi 2013 Similarly, in a second trial by the same researchers in patients with nonalcoholic liver steatohepatitis and metabolic syndrome (N=107), use of bergamot polyphenolic extract for 4 months produced reductions in fasting plasma glucose, serum LDL-C, and triglycerides, and an increase in HDL-C.Gliozzi 2016</p><h2>Dosing</h2><h3>Cognitive dysfunction</h3><p>An open-label pilot study examined the effects of bergamot-derived polyphenolic fraction (500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks as adjunctive therapy), on cognitive dysfunction in patients being treated for schizophrenia. The capsules contained 5 main flavonoids: neoeriocitrin, naringin, neohesperidin, melitidin, and brutieridin.Bruno 2017</p><h3>Dyslipidemia</h3><p>Effects of bergamot-derived polyphenolic fraction containing 28% flavonoids (principally naringin, neoeriocitrin, and neohesperidin) on dyslipidemia have been studied at dosages of 500 mg/day and 1,000 mg/day for treatment durations of 1 monthMollace 2011 or 6 months.Giglio 2016 In a study of patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia, a standardized bergamot-derived extract (Bergavit) was given at a fixed daily dose (150 mg of flavonoids, with 16% neoeriocitrin, 47% neohesperidin, and 37% naringin) for 6 months.Toth 2016</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><p>Naringenin and hesperetin have been shown to bind to estrogen receptors, and to inhibit the activity of aromatase (the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of androgens to estrogens), the clinical significance of which is unknown.Gardana 2008</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>Case reports are lacking. Furanocoumarins, as found in grapefruit, are known to inhibit the metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP-450) 3A4, and to a lesser extent CYP1A2, 2C9, and 2D6. They may also influence the transporter P-glycoprotein. An increased bioavailability and decreased metabolism of medicines dependent on this system may be expected, with a consequent risk of toxicity.Seden 2010</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Limited clinical studies in hyperlipidemia suggest bergamot juice is safe and well toleratedMannucci 2017; heartburn was reported in a study using bergamot polyphenolic fraction (500 mg twice daily).Bruno 2017</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Information is limited. In acute and subchronic toxicity tests in rodents, a lack of hematological and histopathological toxicity was reported.Mannucci 2017</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
