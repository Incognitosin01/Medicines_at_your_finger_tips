</ul><h2>Se-Natal 19 Description</h2><p class="First">Se·Natal 19 Chewable tablets are round, debossed "TL015." These tablets provide oil-soluble vitamins, water-soluble vitamins and minerals. Each tablet contains:</p><p class="First">Vitamin A (as beta carotene)</p><h2>​CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">Oral iron is absorbed most efficiently when administered between meals.  Iron is critical for normal hemogloblin syntheis to maintain oxygen transport, energy production and proper function of cells. Adequate amounts of iron are necessary for effective erythropoiesis. Iron also serves as a cofactor of several essential enzymes, including cytochromes, which are involved in electron transport. Folic acid is required for nucleoprotein synthesis and the maintenance of normal erythropoiesis. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Deficiency of folic acid may account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megablastic macrocytic anemias. Vitamin B<span class="Sub">​12</span>​ is essential to growth cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, nucleic acid, and myelin synthesis. Deficiency may result in megaloblastic anemia or pernicious anemia.</p><h2>​OTHER INGREDIENTS</h2><p class="First">Acacia, Fumed Silica, Magnesium Stearate, Natural Orange Flavour, Orange Juice Powder, Stearic Acid, Stevia, Sucrose.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Se-Natal 19</h2><p class="First">Se-Natal 19 Chewable Tablets are indicated for use in improving the nutritional status of women throughout pregnancy and in the postnatal period for both lactating and non-lactating mothers. Se-Natal 19 Chewable Tablets are also useful in improving the nutritional status of women prior to conception.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is deficient.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>GENERAL</h3><p class="First">Take 2 hours after meals. Do not exceed recommended dose. Discontinue use if symptoms of intolerance appear.</p><h3>​Folic Acid</h3><p class="First">Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia. In that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.</p><h3>​Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>​Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Dosing for elderly patients should be cautious. Due to the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy, dosing should start at the lower end of the dosing range.</p><h2>​ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions with iron therapy may include GI irritation, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Adverse reactions with iron therapy are usually transient. Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Prescriber should be aware of a number of iron/drug interactions, including antacids, tetracyclines, or fluoroquinolones.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Symptoms:</h3><p class="First">Abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis, anuria, CNS damage, coma, convulsions, death, dehydration, diffuse vascular congestion, hepatic cirrhosis, hypotension, hypothermia, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tarry stools, melena, hematemesis, tachycardia, hyperglycemia, drowsiness, pallor, cyanosis, lassitude, seizures, and shock.</p><h2>Se-Natal 19 Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">One tablet daily, or as directed by a physician.</p><h2>NOTICE</h2><p class="First">Contact with moisture can discolor or erode the tablet.</p><h2>How is Se-Natal 19 Supplied</h2><p class="First">Se-Natal 19 Chewable Tablets for oral administration are supplied as multi-color-speckled, round tablets debossed "TL015," packaged in bottles of 100 tablets.</p><p><span class="Bold">Product Code: 13925-117-01</span></p><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Store at 20°-25°C (68°-77°F), excursions permitted to 15°-30°C (59°-86°F)[See USP controlled room temperature].</p><h2>PHARMACIST</h2><p class="First">Dispense in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP/INF with child-resistant closure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Call your doctor about side effects.
