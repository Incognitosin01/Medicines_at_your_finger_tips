This facilitates transmission of impulses across myoneural junction and results in increased cholinergic response. </p><p>Atropine: Minimizes or prevents the muscarinic cholinergic effects caused by edrophonium (eg, bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, increased secretions).</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Edrophonium: Primarily urine (67%)</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p> Edrophonium: Antagonism of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants: 3 minutes; Atropine: Heart rate: Immediate</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Edrophonium: Antagonism of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants: 1.2 minutes; Atropine: Heart rate: 2 to 16 minutes</p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>Edrophonium: Antagonism of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants: 70 minutes; Atropine: Heart rate: 170 minutes</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Edrophonium: Adults: 1.2 to 2.4 hours; Anephric patients: 2.4 to 4.4 hours</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>Atropine: ~14%</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Respiratory depression caused by curare overdosage:</b> Adjunctive treatment of respiratory depression caused by curare overdosage.</p><p><b>Reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents:</b> Reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agents. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to edrophonium, atropine, or any component of the formulation; intestinal or urinary obstruction of the mechanical type. Atropine is contraindicated in acute glaucoma, adhesions (synechiae) between the iris and lens of the eye, and pyloric stenosis. </p><p>Documentation of allergenic cross-reactivity for anticholinesterase muscle stimulants is limited.
