It is an aminoglycoside antibiotic, which inhibits protein synthesis by binding with ribosomal RNA and causing misreading of the bacterial genetic code.</p><p>Polymyxin B is bactericidal for a variety of gram-negative organisms. It increases the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane by interacting with the phospholipid components of the membrane.</p><p>Bacitracin is bactericidal for a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. It interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis by inhibition of the regeneration of phospholipid receptors involved in peptidoglycan synthesis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Microbiology:</span> Neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B sulfate and bacitracin zinc together are considered active against the following microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumonia, Escherichiacoli, Haemophilusinfluenzae, Klebsiella/Enterobacter species, Neisseria species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
