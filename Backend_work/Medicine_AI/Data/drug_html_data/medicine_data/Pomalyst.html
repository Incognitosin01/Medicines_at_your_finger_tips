It promotes immune responses to help slow tumor growth.</p><p>Pomalyst is used to treat multiple myeloma (cancer resulting from a progressive blood disease). It is usually given after at least two other medications have been tried without success.</p><p>Pomalyst is also used to treat AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma (KS) when highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has not worked well enough or stopped working. This medicine can also be used to treat Kaposi Sarcoma in adults who are HIV-negative.</p><p>Pomalyst is available only from a certified pharmacy under a special program. You must be registered in the program and agree to use birth control measures as required.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Never use Pomalyst you are pregnant. Even one dose of pomalidomide can cause severe, life-threatening birth defects or death of a baby if the mother or the father is taking this medicine at the time of conception or during pregnancy.</b></p><p>Use birth control to prevent pregnancy, whether you are a man or a woman. For women: Use two forms of birth control beginning 4 weeks before you start taking Pomalyst and ending 4 weeks after you stop taking it. For men: Use a condom to prevent pregnancy while you are taking Pomalyst, and for up to 4 weeks after you stop taking it.</p><p>Pomalyst may cause blood clots. Call your doctor at once if you have symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, sudden numbness or weakness, problems with vision or speech, or swelling or redness in an arm or leg.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Pomalyst if you are allergic to pomalidomide, or if you are pregnant.</p><p><b>Pomalidomide can cause severe, life-threatening birth defects or death of a baby if the mother or father is taking this medicine at the time of conception or during pregnancy.</b> Even one dose of Pomalyst can cause major defects of the baby's arms and legs, bones, ears, eyes, face, and heart. <b>Never use pomalidomide if you are pregnant.</b> Tell your doctor right away if your period is late while taking this medicine.</p><p><b>For women (if you have not had a hysterectomy):</b> Do not use Pomalyst if you are pregnant. Use two forms of birth control beginning 4 weeks before you start taking Pomalyst and ending 4 weeks after your last dose. Even women with fertility problems are required to use birth control while taking this medicine. You must also have a negative pregnancy test at 10 to 14 days before treatment and again at 24 hours before. While you are taking Pomalyst, you will have a pregnancy test every 2 to 4 weeks.</p><p>The birth control method must be proven highly effective (birth control pills, intrauterine device, tubal ligation, sex partner's vasectomy). The extra form must be a barrier method such as a latex condom, a diaphragm, or a cervical cap.</p><p><b>Stop using Pomalyst and call your doctor at once if you quit using birth control, if your period is late, or if you think you might be pregnant.</b> Not having sexual intercourse (abstinence) is the most effective method of preventing pregnancy.</p><p><b>For men:</b> If a man fathers a baby while using pomalidomide, the baby may have birth defects. Use a condom to prevent pregnancy while taking Pomalyst, and for up to 4 weeks after your last dose. <b>You must agree in writing to always use latex condoms when having sex with a woman who is able to get pregnant, even if you have had a vasectomy.</b> Contact your doctor if you have had unprotected sex, even once, or if your sex partner may be pregnant.</p><p>This medicine may affect fertility (ability to have children) if you are a woman. However, it is important to use birth control to prevent pregnancy because pomalidomide can harm an unborn baby.</p><p>If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry to track the effects of pomalidomide on the baby.</p><p>To make sure Pomalyst is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had</p><ul>
