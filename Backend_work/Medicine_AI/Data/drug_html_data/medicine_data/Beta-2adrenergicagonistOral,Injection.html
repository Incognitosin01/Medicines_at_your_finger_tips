</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for this Medicine</h2><p>Adrenergic bronchodilators are medicines that stimulate the nerves in many parts of the body, causing different effects.</p><p>Because these medicines open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) of the lungs, they are used to treat the symptoms of asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and other lung diseases. They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.</p><p>Epinephrine injection (including the auto-injector but not the sterile suspension) is used in the emergency treatment of allergic reactions to insect stings, medicines, foods, or other substances. It relieves skin rash, hives, and itching; wheezing; and swelling of the lips, eyelids, tongue, and inside of the nose.</p><p>These medicines may be also used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.</p><p>Ephedrine capsules are available without a prescription. However, check with your doctor before taking ephedrine.</p><p>All of the other adrenergic bronchodilators are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using this Medicine</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>There is no specific information comparing use of isoproterenol, metaproterenol, or terbutaline in children with use in other age groups.</p><p>Excitement and nervousness may be more common in children 2 to 6 years of age who take albuterol than in adults and older children.</p><p>Infants and children may be especially sensitive to the effects of epinephrine.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of these medicines, such as trembling, high blood pressure, or fast or irregular heartbeats.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Some of these medicines can increase blood sugar, blood pressure, and heart rate in the mother, and may increase the heart rate and decrease blood sugar in the infant. Before taking any of these medicines, make sure your doctor knows if you are pregnant or may become pregnant.</p><p>Some of these medicines also relax the muscles of the uterus and may delay labor.</p><p><i>For albuterol</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Albuterol has not been studied in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown that albuterol causes birth defects when given in doses many times the usual human dose.</li>
</ul><p><i>For ephedrine</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Ephedrine has not been studied in pregnant women or in animals.</li>
</ul><p><i>For epinephrine</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Epinephrine has been shown to cause birth defects in humans. However, this medicine may be needed during allergic reactions that threaten the mother's life.</li>
</ul><p><i>For isoproterenol</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Studies on birth defects with isoproterenol have not been done in humans. However, there is some evidence that it causes birth defects in animals.</li>
</ul><p><i>For metaproterenol</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Metaproterenol has not been studied in pregnant women. However, studies in animals have shown that metaproterenol causes birth defects and death of the animal fetus when given in doses many times the usual human dose.</li>
</ul><p><i>For terbutaline</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Terbutaline has not been shown to cause birth defects in humans using recommended doses or in animal studies when given in doses many times the usual human dose.</li>
</ul><h3>Breast Feeding</h3><p><i>For albuterol, isoproterenol, and metaproterenol</i>:</p><ul>
<li>It is not known whether albuterol, isoproterenol, or metaproterenol passes into breast milk. Although most medicines pass into breast milk in small amounts, many of them may be used safely while breast-feeding. Mothers who are taking this medicine and who wish to breast-feed should discuss this with their doctor.</li>
</ul><p><i>For ephedrine</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Ephedrine passes into breast milk and may cause unwanted side effects in babies of mothers using ephedrine.</li>
</ul><p><i>For epinephrine</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Epinephrine passes into breast milk and may cause unwanted side effects in babies of mothers using epinephrine.</li>
</ul><p><i>For terbutaline</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Terbutaline passes into breast milk but has not been shown to cause harmful effects in the infant. Mothers who are taking this medicine and who wish to breast-feed should discuss this with their doctor.</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with Medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
