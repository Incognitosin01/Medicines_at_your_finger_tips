</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Clindamycin Foam</h2><p class="First">Clindamycin phosphate foam is indicated for topical application in the treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older.</p><h2>Clindamycin Foam Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Clindamycin phosphate foam is for topical use only, and not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.</p><p>Apply clindamycin phosphate foam once daily to affected areas after the skin is washed with mild soap and allowed to fully dry. Use enough to cover the entire affected area.</p><p>If there has been no improvement after 6 to 8 weeks or if the condition becomes worse, treatment should be discontinued.</p><p>The contents of clindamycin phosphate foam are flammable; avoid fire, flame and/or smoking during and immediately following application.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">White to off-white thermolabile foam. Each gram of clindamycin phosphate foam contains, as dispensed, 12 mg (1.2%) of clindamycin phosphate, equivalent to 10 mg (1%) of clindamycin.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Clindamycin phosphate foam is contraindicated in individuals with a history of regional enteritis or ulcerative colitis, or a history of antibiotic-associated colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis).</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Colitis</h3><p class="First">Systemic absorption of clindamycin has been demonstrated following topical use of this product. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical clindamycin. If significant diarrhea occurs, clindamycin phosphate foam should be discontinued. <span class="Italics">[See Adverse Reactions (6.2).]</span></p><p>Severe colitis has occurred following oral or parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen severe colitis. Severe colitis may result in death.</p><p>Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by <span class="Italics">Clostridia</span> is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> and stool assay for <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> toxin may be helpful diagnostically.</p><h3>Irritation</h3><p class="First">Clindamycin phosphate foam can cause irritation. Concomitant topical acne therapy should be used with caution since a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating, or abrasive agents. If irritation or dermatitis occurs, clindamycin should be discontinued.</p><p>Avoid contact of clindamycin phosphate foam with eyes, mouth, lips, other mucous membranes or areas of broken skin. If contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate foam should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>A total of 439 subjects with mild to moderate acne vulgaris were treated once daily for 12 weeks with clindamycin phosphate foam.</p><p>The incidence of adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% of the subjects in clinical trials comparing clindamycin phosphate foam and its vehicle is presented in Table 1.</p><p>In a contact sensitization study, none of the 203 subjects developed evidence of allergic contact sensitization to clindamycin phosphate foam.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of clindamycin phosphate foam: application site pain, application site erythema, diarrhea, urticaria, abdominal pain, hypersensitivity, rash, abdominal discomfort, nausea, seborrhea, application site rash, dizziness, pain of skin, colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis), and hemorrhagic diarrhea. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal disturbances, as well as gram-negative folliculitis, have also been reported in association with the use of topical formulations of clindamycin. Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin have been associated with severe colitis, which may end fatally.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Erythromycin</h3><p class="First">Clindamycin phosphate foam should not be used in combination with topical or oral erythromycin-containing products due to possible antagonism to its clindamycin component. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown antagonism between these two antimicrobials. The clinical significance of this <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> antagonism is not known.</p><h3>Neuromuscular Blocking Agents</h3><p class="First">Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, clindamycin phosphate foam should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category B: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women treated with clindamycin phosphate foam. Clindamycin phosphate foam should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and mice using subcutaneous and oral doses of clindamycin phosphate, clindamycin hydrochloride and clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride. These studies revealed no evidence of fetal harm. The highest dose used in the rat and mouse teratogenicity studies was equivalent to a clindamycin phosphate dose of 432 mg/kg. For a rat, this dose is 84 fold higher, and for a mouse 42 fold higher, than the anticipated human dose of clindamycin phosphate from clindamycin phosphate foam based on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> comparison.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether clindamycin is excreted in human milk following use of clindamycin phosphate foam. However, orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><p>If used during lactation and clindamycin phosphate foam is applied to the chest, care should be taken to avoid accidental ingestion by the infant.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of clindamycin phosphate foam in children under the age of 12 have not been studied.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The clinical study with clindamycin phosphate foam did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine if they respond differently than younger subjects.</p><h2>Clindamycin Foam Description</h2><p class="First">Clindamycin phosphate foam contains clindamycin (1%) as clindamycin phosphate.</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate is a water-soluble ester of the semi-synthetic antibiotic produced by a 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of the parent antibiotic, lincomycin. The chemical name for clindamycin phosphate is methyl 7-chloro-6,7,8-trideoxy-6-(1-methyl-<span class="Italics">trans</span>-4-propyl-L-2-pyrrolidinecarboxamido)-1-thio-L-<span class="Italics">threo-</span>α<span class="Italics">-</span>D<span class="Italics">-galacto</span>-octopyranoside 2-(dihydrogen phosphate).</p><p>The structural formula for clindamycin phosphate is represented below:</p><p>Molecular Formula: C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">34</span>ClN<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">8</span>PS<br/>
Molecular Weight: 504.97 g/mol</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate foam contains clindamycin (1%) as clindamycin phosphate, at a concentration equivalent to 10 mg clindamycin per gram in a thermolabile hydroethanolic foam vehicle consisting of cetyl alcohol, dehydrated alcohol, polysorbate 60, propylene glycol, purified water, and stearyl alcohol pressurized with a hydrocarbon (propane/butane) propellant.</p><h2>Clindamycin Foam - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Mechanism of action in acne vulgaris is unknown. <span class="Italics">[See Microbiology (12.4)]</span></p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Pharmacodynamics of clindamycin phosphate foam is unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">In an open label, parallel group study in 24 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 subjects (3 male and 9 female) applied 4 grams of clindamycin phosphate foam once-daily for five days, and 12 subjects (7 male and 5 female) applied 4 grams of a clindamycin gel, 1%, once daily for five days. On Day 5, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">(0-12)</span> were 23% and 9% lower, respectively, for clindamycin phosphate foam than for the clindamycin gel, 1%.</p><p>Following multiple applications of clindamycin phosphate foam, less than 0.024% of the total dose was excreted unchanged in the urine over 12 hours on Day 5.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">No microbiology studies were conducted in the clinical trials with this product.</p><p>Clindamycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria and prevents elongation of peptide chains by interfering with peptidyl transfer, thereby suppressing protein synthesis. Clindamycin has been shown to have <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> activity against <span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes)</span>, an organism that has been associated with acne vulgaris; however, the clinical significance of this activity against <span class="Italics">P. acnes</span> was not examined in clinical studies with clindamycin phosphate foam. <span class="Italics">P. acnes</span> resistance to clindamycin has been documented.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Inducible Clindamycin Resistance</span></p><p>The treatment of acne with antimicrobials is associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance in <span class="Italics">P. acnes</span> as well as other bacteria (e.g. <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus,</span> <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span>). The use of clindamycin may result in developing inducible resistance in these organisms. This resistance is not detected by routine susceptibility testing.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Cross Resistance</span></p><p>Resistance to clindamycin is often associated with resistance to erythromycin.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">The carcinogenicity of a 1.2% clindamycin phosphate gel similar to clindamycin phosphate foam was evaluated by daily application to mice for two years. The daily doses used in this study were approximately 3 and 15 times higher than the human dose of clindamycin phosphate from 5 milliliters of clindamycin phosphate foam, assuming complete absorption and based on a body surface area comparison. No significant increase in tumors was noted in the treated animals.</p><p>A 1.2% clindamycin phosphate gel similar to clindamycin phosphate foam caused a statistically significant shortening of the median time to tumor onset in a study in hairless mice in which tumors were induced by exposure to simulated sunlight.</p><p>Genotoxicity tests performed included a rat micronucleus test and an Ames Salmonella reversion test. Both tests were negative.</p><p>Reproduction studies in rats using oral doses of clindamycin hydrochloride and clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial, subjects with mild to moderate acne vulgaris used clindamycin phosphate foam or the vehicle foam once daily for twelve weeks. Treatment response, defined as the proportion of subjects clear or almost clear, based on the Investigator Static Global Assessment (ISGA), and the mean percent reductions in lesion counts at the end of treatment in this study are shown in Table 2.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First">Clindamycin phosphate foam containing clindamycin phosphate equivalent to 10 mg clindamycin per gram, is white to off-white in color and thermolabile.
