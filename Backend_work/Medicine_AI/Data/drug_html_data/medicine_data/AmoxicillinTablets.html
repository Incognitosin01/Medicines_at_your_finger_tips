</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Amoxicillin Tablets</h2><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of amoxicillin and other antibacterial drugs, Amoxicillin Tablets should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data,local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><p>Amoxicillin Tablets are indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY β-lactamase-negative) isolates of the designated bacteria in the conditions listed below:</p><h3>1.1 Infections of the ear, nose, and throat</h3><p class="First">– due to <span class="Italics">Streptococcus species</span>.<br/>
(α- and β-hemolytic isolates only), <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae,</span><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus spp.</span>, or <span class="Italics">Haemophilus </span><span class="Italics">influenzae.</span></p><h3>1.2 Infections of the genitourinary tract</h3><p class="First">– due to <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>, <span class="Italics">Proteus mirabilis</span>, or <span class="Italics">Enterococcus faecalis.</span> </p><h3>1.3 Infections of the skin and skin structure</h3><p class="First"> – due to <span class="Italics">Streptococcus</span> spp.<br/>
(α- and β-hemolytic isolates only), <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus</span> spp., or <span class="Italics">E. coli.</span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><h3>1.4 Infections of the lower respiratory tract</h3><p class="First">– due to <span class="Italics">Streptococcus</span> spp.<br/>
(α- and β-hemolytic isolates only), <span class="Italics">S. pneumoniae</span>, <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus</span> spp., or <span class="Italics">H. influenzae.</span></p><h3>1.5 Gonorrhea, acute uncomplicated (ano-genital and urethral infections)</h3><p class="First">– due to <span class="Italics">Neisser</span>ia <span class="Italics">gonorrhoeae.</span><br/>
Because of high rates of amoxicillin resistance, Amoxicillin Tablets are not recommended for empiric treatment of gonorrhea. Amoxicillin Tablets use should be limited to situations where <span class="Italics">N. gonorrhoeae </span>isolates are known to be susceptible to amoxicillin.</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><h3>1.6 Triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori with clarithromycin and lansoprazole</h3><p class="First">Amoxicillin Tablets, in combination with clarithromycin plus lansoprazole as triple therapy, are indicated for the treatment of patients with <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1-year history of a duodenal ulcer) to eradicate <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span>. Eradication of <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> has been shown to reduce the risk of<br/>
duodenal ulcer recurrence.</p><h3>1.7 Dual therapy for H. pylori with lansoprazole</h3><p class="First">Amoxicillin Tablets, in combination with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules as dual therapy, are indicated for the treatment of patients with <span class="Italics">H. pylori </span>infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1-year history of a duodenal ulcer) <span class="Bold">who are either allergic or intolerant to clarithromycin or in whom resistance to clarithromycin is known or suspected.</span> (See the clarithromycin package insert, MICROBIOLOGY.) Eradication of <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.</p><h2>Amoxicillin Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>2.1 Dosing for Adult and Pediatric Patients &gt; 3 Months of Age</h3><p class="First">Except for gonorrhea, treatment should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. It is recommended that there be at least 10 days’ treatment for any infection caused by <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span> to prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever. In some infections, therapy may be required for several weeks. It may be necessary to continue clinical and/or bacteriological follow-up for several months after cessation of therapy.</p><h3>2.2 Dosing in Neonates and Infants Aged ≤ 12 Weeks (≤ 3 Months)</h3><p class="First">Treatment should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. It is recommended that there be at least 10 days’ treatment for any infection caused by <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span> to prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever. Due to incompletely developed renal function affecting elimination of amoxicillin in this age group, the recommended upper dose of amoxicillin 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours. There are currently no dosing recommendations for pediatric patients with impaired renal function.</p><h3>2.3 Dosing for H. pylori Infection</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Triple therapy:</span> The recommended adult oral dose is 1 gram amoxicillin, 500 mg clarithromycin, and 30 mg lansoprazole, all given twice daily (every 12 hours) for 14 days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dual therapy:</span> The recommended adult oral dose is 1 gram amoxicillin and 30 mg lansoprazole, each given three times daily (every 8 hours) for 14 days.</p><p>Please refer to clarithromycin and lansoprazole full prescribing information.</p><h3>2.4 Dosing in Renal Impairment</h3><ul class="Disk">
<li>Patients with impaired renal function do not generally require a reduction in dose unless the impairment is severe.</li>
<li>Severely impaired patients with a glomerular filtration rate of &lt; 30 mL/min. should not receive a 875-mg dose.</li>
<li>Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 10 to 30 mL/min should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 12 hours, depending on the severity of the infection.</li>
<li>Patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/min should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection.</li>
<li>Hemodialysis patients should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection. They should receive an additional dose both during and at the end of dialysis.</li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Amoxicillin Tablets, USP 875 mg. Each tablet contains 875 mg amoxicillin as the trihydrate. Each film-coated, capsule-shaped, white tablet is scored on one side and imprinted WW951 on the other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Amoxicillin is contraindicated in patients who have experienced a serious hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to amoxicillin or to other β-lactam antibiotics (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins).</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>5.1 Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy including amoxicillin. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before initiating therapy with amoxicillin, careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens.</p><h3>5.2 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile.</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.<br/>
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>5.3 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth or Bacterial Resistance</h3><p class="First">The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy.<br/>
If superinfections occur, amoxicillin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.<br/>
Prescribing amoxicillin either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient, and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>5.4 Use in Patients With Mononucleosis</h3><p class="First">A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus amoxicillin should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis.</p><h3>5.5 Phenylketonurics</h3><p class="First">The tablets of amoxicillin do not contain phenylalanine and can be used by phenylketonurics.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:<br/>
•   Anaphylactic reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span><br/>
•   CDAD <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></p><h3>6.1 Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (&gt; 1%) observed in clinical trials of Amoxicillin Tablets were diarrhea, rash, vomiting, and nausea.</p><p><span class="Bold">Triple therapy: T</span>he most frequently reported adverse events for patients who received triple therapy (amoxicillin/clarithromycin/ lansoprazole) were diarrhea (7%), headache (6%), and taste perversion (5%). <span class="Bold"><br/>
Dual therapy:</span> The most frequently reported adverse events for patients who received double therapy amoxicillin/lansoprazole were diarrhea (8%) and headache (7%). For more information on adverse reactions with clarithromycin or lansoprazole, refer to the Adverse Reactions section of their package inserts.</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><h3>6.2 Postmarketing or Other Experience</h3><p class="First">In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during postmarketing use of penicillins. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to amoxicillin.</p><ul class="Disk">
<li><span class="Bold">Infections and Infestations:</span> Mucocutaneous candidiasis.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal</span>: Black hairy tongue, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">H</span></span><span class="Bold">ypersensitivity Reactions:</span> Anaphylaxis <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> (5.1)].</span> Serum sickness–like reactions, erythematous maculopapular rashes, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, and urticaria have been reported.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Liver:</span> A moderate rise in AST and/or ALT has been noted, but the significance of this finding is unknown. Hepatic dysfunction including cholestatic jaundice, hepatic cholestasis and acute cytolytic hepatitis have been reported.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Renal:</span> Crystalluria has been reported <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Hemic and Lymphatic Systems:</span> Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Central Nervous System:</span> Reversible hyperactivity, agitation, anxiety, insomnia, confusion, convulsions, behavioral changes, and/or dizziness have been reported.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Miscellaneous:</span> Tooth discoloration (brown, yellow, or gray staining) has been reported. Most reports occurred in pediatric patients. Discoloration was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases.</li>
</ul><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>7.1 Probenecid</h3><p class="First">Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent use of amoxicillin and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin. </p><h3>7.2 Oral Anticoagulants</h3><p class="First">Abnormal prolongation of prothrombin time (increased international normalized ratio [INR]) has been reported in patients receiving amoxicillin and oral anticoagulants. Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concurrently. Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation.</p><h3>7.3 Allopurinol</h3><p class="First">The concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of amoxicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.</p><h3>7.4 Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First">Amoxicillin may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives. </p><h3>7.5 Other Antibacterials</h3><p class="First">Chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effects of penicillin. This has been demonstrated <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented. </p><h3>7.6 Drug/Laboratory Interactions</h3><p class="First">High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST® (manufactured by Miles, Inc.), Benedict’s Solution, or Fehling’s Solution. Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions [such as CLINISTIX® (manufactured by Bayer Corporation)] be used.</p><p>Following administration of ampicillin or amoxicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted. </p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>8.1 Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects</span></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">:</span> </span>Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (3 and 6 times the 3 g human dose, based on body surface area). There was no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled<br/>
studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, amoxicillin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>8.2 Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">Oral ampicillin is poorly absorbed during labor. It is not known whether use of amoxicillin in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood of the necessity for an obstetrical intervention. </p><h3>8.3 Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Penicillins have been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin is administered to a nursing woman. </p><h3>8.4 Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Because of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed. Dosing of amoxicillin should be modified in pediatric patients 12 weeks or younger (≤ 3 months) <span class="Italics">[See Dosage and Administration (2.2).]</span></p><h3>8.5 Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">An analysis of clinical studies of amoxicillin was conducted to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger subjects. These analyses have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but a greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. </p><h3>8.6 Dosing in Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Amoxicillin is primarily eliminated by the kidney and dosage adjustment is usually required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR &lt;30 mL/min). See Dosing in Renal Impairment (2.4) for specific recommendations in patients with renal impairment. </p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures as required. A prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poison control center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mg/kg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms.</p><p>Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in a small number of patients after overdosage with amoxicillin<span class="Sup">1</span>.</p><p>Crystalluria, in some cases leading to renal failure, has also been reported after amoxicillin overdosage in adult and pediatric patients. In case of overdosage, adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin crystalluria.</p><p>Renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration. High blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of amoxicillin. Amoxicillin may be removed from circulation by hemodialysis. </p><h2>Amoxicillin Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Formulations of Amoxicillin Tablets, USP contain amoxicillin, a semisynthetic antibiotic, an analog of ampicillin, with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. Chemically, it is (2S,5R,6R)-6-[(R)-(-)-2-amino-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-3,3-dimethyl-7-oxo-4-thia-1-zabicyclo[3.2.0]heptane-2-carboxylic acid trihydrate. It may be represented structurally as:</p><p>The amoxicillin molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">16</span>H<span class="Sub">19</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">5</span>S•3H<span class="Sub">2</span>O and the molecular weight is 419.45.</p><p><span class="Bold">Tablets:</span> Each film coated tablet contains 875 mg amoxicillin as the trihydrate. Each film-coated, capsule shaped, white tablet is scored on one side and imprinted WW951 on the other side. Inactive ingredients: colloidal silicone dioxide, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol-partially hydrolized, polyethylene glycol, sodium starch glycolate, talc, and titanium dioxide</p><h2>Amoxicillin Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Amoxicillin is an antibacterial drug. <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)].</span> </p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption: </span></span> Amoxicillin is stable in the presence of gastric acid and is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The effect of food on the absorption of amoxicillin from the tablets and suspension of amoxicillin has been partially investigated; 400 mg and 875 mg formulations have been studied only when administered at the start of a light meal.</p><p>Orally administered doses of 250 mg and 500 mg amoxicillin capsules result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in the range of 3.5 mcg/mL to 5 mcg/mL and 5.5 mcg/mL to 7.5 mcg/mL, respectively.</p><p>Mean amoxicillin pharmacokinetic parameters from an open, two-part, single-dose crossover bioequivalence study in 27 adults comparing 875 mg of amoxicillin with 875 mg of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium showed that the 875 mg tablet of amoxicillin produces an AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> of 35.4 ± 8.1 mcg•hr/mL and a C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 13.8 ± 4.1 mcg/mL. Dosing was at the start of a light meal following an overnight fast.</p><p>Orally administered doses of amoxicillin suspension, 125 mg/5 mL and 250 mg/5 mL, result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in the range of 1.5 mcg/mL to 3 mcg/mL and 3.5 mcg/mL to 5 mcg/mL, respectively.</p><p>Oral administration of single doses of 400 mg chewable tablets and 400 mg/5 mL suspension of amoxicillin to 24 adult volunteers yielded comparable pharmacokinetic data: </p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Distribution:</span></span> Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids, with the exception of brain and spinal fluid, except when meninges are inflamed. In blood serum, amoxicillin is approximately 20% protein-bound. Following a 1-gram dose and utilizing a special skin window technique to determine levels of the antibiotic, it was noted that therapeutic levels were found in the interstitial fluid.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Excretion: </span></span>The half-life of amoxicillin is 61.3 minutes. Approximately 60% of an orally administered dose of amoxicillin is excreted in the urine within 6 to 8 hours. Detectable serum levels are observed up to 8 hours after an orally administered dose of amoxicillin. Since most of the amoxicillin is excreted unchanged in the urine, its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid <span class="Italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)].</span> </p><h3>12.4 Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Mechanism of Action<br/></span></span> Amoxicillin is similar to penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible bacteria during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis that leads to the death of the bacteria. <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><br/>
Method of Resistance<br/></span></span> Resistance to amoxicillin is mediated primarily through enzymes called beta-lactamases that cleave the beta-lactam ring of amoxicillin, rendering it inactive.</p><p>Amoxicillin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the bacteria listed below, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections as described in the  INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Susceptibility Testing<br/></span></span> For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Studies to detect mutagenic potential of amoxicillin alone have not been conducted; however, the following information is available from tests on a 4:1 mixture of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate. Amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate was non-mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay, and the yeast gene conversion assay. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium was weakly positive in the mouse lymphoma assay, but the trend toward increased mutation frequencies in this assay occurred at doses that were also associated with decreased cell survival. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium was negative in the mouse micronucleus test and in the dominant lethal assay in mice. Potassium clavulanate alone was tested in the Ames bacterial mutation assay and in the mouse micronucleus test, and was negative in each of these assays. In a multi-generation reproduction study in rats, no impairment of fertility or other adverse reproductive effects were seen at doses up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 2 times the 3 g human dose based on body surface area).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>14.1 H. pylori Eradication to Reduce the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence</h3><p class="First">Randomized, double-blind clinical studies performed in the United States in patients with <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> and duodenal ulcer disease (defined as an active ulcer or history of an ulcer within 1 year) evaluated the efficacy of lansoprazole in combination with amoxicillin capsules and clarithromycin tablets as triple 14-day therapy, or in combination with amoxicillin capsules as dual 14-day therapy, for the eradication of <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span>. Based on the results of these studies, the safety and efficacy of 2 different eradication regimens were established: <span class="Bold">Triple therapy:</span> Amoxicillin 1 gram twice daily/clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily/lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily (see Table 6). <span class="Bold">Dual therapy:</span> Amoxicillin 1 gram three times daily/lansoprazole 30 mg three times daily (see Table 7). All treatments were for 14 days. <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> eradication was defined as 2 negative tests (culture and histology) at 4 to 6 weeks following the end of treatment. Triple therapy was shown to be more effective than all possible dual therapy combinations. Dual therapy was shown to be more effective than both monotherapies. Eradication of <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">1.

<li>Patients should be advised that Amoxicillin Tablets may be taken every 8 hours or every 12 hours, depending on the dose prescribed.</li>
<li>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Amoxicillin Tablets, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Amoxicillin Tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Amoxicillin Tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.<br/></li>
</ul><ul class="Disk">
<li>Patients should be counseled that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, and it usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken their last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Patients should be aware that Amoxicillin Tablets contains a penicillin class drug product that can cause allergic reactions in some individuals.</li>
