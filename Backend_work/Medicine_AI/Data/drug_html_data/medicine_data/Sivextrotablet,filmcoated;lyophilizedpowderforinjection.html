</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Sivextro</h2><h3>Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections</h3><p class="First">Sivextro<span class="Sup">®</span> is an oxazolidinone-class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by susceptible isolates of the following Gram-positive microorganisms: <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (including methicillin-resistant [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible [MSSA] isolates), <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span>, <span class="Italics">Streptococcus agalactiae</span>, <span class="Italics">Streptococcus anginosus</span> Group (including <span class="Italics">Streptococcus anginosus</span>, <span class="Italics">Streptococcus intermedius</span>, and <span class="Italics">Streptococcus constellatus</span>), and <span class="Italics">Enterococcus faecalis</span>.</p><h3>Usage</h3><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Sivextro and other antibacterial drugs, Sivextro should be used only to treat ABSSSI that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Sivextro Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosage</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of Sivextro is 200 mg administered once daily for six (6) days either orally (with or without food) or as an intravenous (IV) infusion in patients 18 years of age or older.</p><p>The recommended dosage and administration is described in Table 1.</p><p>No dose adjustment is necessary when changing from intravenous to oral Sivextro.</p><p>If patients miss a dose, they should take it as soon as possible anytime up to 8 hours prior to their next scheduled dose. If less than 8 hours remain before the next dose, wait until their next scheduled dose.</p><h3>Preparation and Administration of Intravenous Solution</h3><p class="First">Sivextro is supplied as a sterile, lyophilized powder for injection in single-use vials of 200 mg. Each 200 mg vial must be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection and subsequently diluted only with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.</p><p>Sivextro vials contain no antimicrobial preservatives and are intended for single use only.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Preparation</span></p><p>The contents of the vial should be reconstituted using aseptic technique as follows:</p><p>Note: To minimize foaming, AVOID vigorous agitation or shaking of the vial during or after reconstitution.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Administration</span></p><p>Administer as an intravenous infusion only.</p><p>Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. Do not mix Sivextro with other drugs when administering. It is not intended for intra-arterial, intramuscular, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration.</p><p>The intravenous bag containing the reconstituted and diluted intravenous solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration. Discard if visible particles are observed. The resulting solution is clear and colorless to pale-yellow in color.</p><p>After reconstitution and dilution, Sivextro is to be administered via intravenous infusion using a total time of 1 hour.</p><p>The total time from reconstitution to administration should not exceed 24 hours at room temperature or under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).</p><h3>Compatible Intravenous Solutions</h3><p class="First">Sivextro is compatible with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.</p><h3>Incompatibilities</h3><p class="First">Sivextro for injection is incompatible with any solution containing divalent cations (e.g., Ca<span class="Sup">2+</span>, Mg<span class="Sup">2+</span>), including Lactated Ringer's Injection and Hartmann's Solution.</p><p>Limited data are available on the compatibility of Sivextro for injection with other intravenous substances, additives or other medications and they should not be added to Sivextro single-use vials or infused simultaneously. If the same intravenous line is used for sequential infusion of several different drugs, the line should be flushed before and after infusion of Sivextro with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Sivextro 200 mg tablet is a yellow film-coated oval tablet; each tablet is debossed with "TZD" on one side and "200" on the other side.</p><p>Sivextro for injection is a sterile, white to off-white lyophilized powder for injection in single-use vials of 200 mg. Each 200 mg vial must be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection and subsequently diluted only with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Patients with Neutropenia</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of Sivextro in patients with neutropenia (neutrophil counts &lt;1000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>) have not been adequately evaluated. In an animal model of infection, the antibacterial activity of Sivextro was reduced in the absence of granulocytes [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</span>]. Alternative therapies should be considered when treating patients with neutropenia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial agents including Sivextro, with severity ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents can alter the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterial use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> should be discontinued, if possible. Appropriate measures such as fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing Sivextro in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be compared directly to rates from clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice.</p><p>Adverse reactions were evaluated for 1050 patients treated with Sivextro and 662 patients treated with the comparator antibacterial drug in two Phase 2 and two Phase 3 clinical trials. The median age of patients treated with Sivextro in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials was 42 years, ranging between 17 and 86 years old. Patients treated with Sivextro were predominantly male (65%) and White (82%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation</span></p><p>Serious adverse reactions occurred in 12/662 (1.8%) of patients treated with Sivextro and in 13/662 (2.0%) of patients treated with the comparator. Sivextro was discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 3/662 (0.5%) of patients and the comparator was discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 6/662 (0.9%) of patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Most Common Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with Sivextro were nausea (8%), headache (6%), diarrhea (4%), vomiting (3%), and dizziness (2%). The median time of onset of adverse reactions was 5 days for both Sivextro and linezolid with 12% occurring on the second day of treatment in both treatment groups.</p><p>Table 2 lists selected adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of patients treated with Sivextro in clinical trials.</p><p>The following selected adverse reactions were reported in Sivextro-treated patients at a rate of less than 2% in these clinical trials:</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders:</span> anemia</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> palpitations, tachycardia</p><p><span class="Italics">Eye Disorders:</span> asthenopia, vision blurred, visual impairment, vitreous floaters</p><p><span class="Italics">General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:</span> infusion-related reactions</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune System Disorders:</span> drug hypersensitivity</p><p><span class="Italics">Infections and Infestations:</span> <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> colitis, oral candidiasis, vulvovaginal mycotic infection</p><p><span class="Italics">Investigations:</span> hepatic transaminases increased, white blood cell count decreased</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System Disorders:</span> hypoesthesia, paresthesia, VII<span class="Sup">th</span> nerve paralysis</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric Disorders:</span> insomnia</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:</span> pruritus, urticaria, dermatitis</p><p><span class="Italics">Vascular Disorders:</span> flushing, hypertension</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Laboratory Parameters</span></p><p>Hematology laboratory abnormalities that were determined to be potentially clinically significant in the pooled Phase 3 ABSSSI clinical trials are provided in Table 3.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Myelosuppression</span></p><p>Phase 1 studies conducted in healthy adults exposed to Sivextro for 21 days showed a possible dose and duration effect on hematologic parameters beyond 6 days of treatment. In the Phase 3 trials, clinically significant changes in these parameters were generally similar for both treatment arms (see Table 3).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Peripheral and Optic Neuropathy</span></p><p>Peripheral and optic neuropathy have been described in patients treated with another member of the oxazolidinone class for longer than 28 days. In Phase 3 trials, reported adverse reactions for peripheral neuropathy and optic nerve disorders were similar between both treatment arms (peripheral neuropathy 1.2% vs. 0.6% for tedizolid phosphate and linezolid, respectively; optic nerve disorders 0.3% vs. 0.2%, respectively). No data are available for patients exposed to Sivextro for longer than 6 days.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Orally administered Sivextro inhibits Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) in the intestine, which can increase the plasma concentrations of orally administered BCRP substrates, and the potential for adverse reactions. If possible, an interruption in the treatment of the co-administered BCRP substrate medicinal product should be considered during treatment with Sivextro, especially for BCRP substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., methotrexate or topotecan). If coadministration cannot be avoided, monitor for adverse reactions related to the concomitantly administered BCRP substrates, including rosuvastatin. [<span class="Italics">See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).</span>]</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C</span></p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Sivextro in pregnant women. Sivextro should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>In embryo-fetal studies, tedizolid phosphate was shown to produce fetal developmental toxicities in mice, rats, and rabbits. Fetal developmental effects occurring in mice in the absence of maternal toxicity included reduced fetal weights and an increased incidence of costal cartilage anomalies at the high dose of 25 mg/kg/day (4-fold the estimated human exposure level based on AUCs). In rats, decreased fetal weights and increased skeletal variations including reduced ossification of the sternebrae, vertebrae, and skull were observed at the high dose of 15 mg/kg/day (6-fold the estimated human exposure based on AUCs) and were associated with maternal toxicity (reduced maternal body weights). In rabbits, reduced fetal weights but no malformations or variations were observed at doses associated with maternal toxicity. The no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) for fetal toxicity in mice (5 mg/kg/day), maternal and fetal toxicity in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day), and rabbits (1 mg/kg/day) were associated with tedizolid plasma area under the curve (AUC) values approximately equivalent to (mice and rats) or 0.04-fold (rabbit) the tedizolid AUC value associated with the oral human therapeutic dose.</p><p>In a pre-postnatal study, there were no adverse maternal or offspring effects when female rats were treated during pregnancy and lactation with tedizolid phosphate at the highest tested dose of 3.75 mg/kg/day, with plasma tedizolid exposure (AUC) approximately equivalent to the human plasma AUC exposure at the clinical dose of 200 mg/day.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Tedizolid is excreted in the breast milk of rats. It is not known whether tedizolid is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Sivextro is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Sivextro did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. No overall differences in pharmacokinetics were observed between elderly subjects and younger subjects.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of overdosage, Sivextro should be discontinued and general supportive treatment given. Hemodialysis does not result in meaningful removal of tedizolid from systemic circulation.</p><h2>Sivextro Description</h2><p class="First">Sivextro (tedizolid phosphate), a phosphate prodrug, is converted to tedizolid in the presence of phosphatases.</p><p>Tedizolid phosphate has the chemical name [(5<span class="Italics">R</span>)-(3-{3-Fluoro-4-[6-(2-methyl-2<span class="Italics">H</span>-tetrazol- 5-yl) pyridin-3-yl]phenyl}-2-oxooxazolidin- 5-yl]methyl hydrogen phosphate.</p><p>Its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">16</span>FN<span class="Sub">6</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span>P and its molecular weight is 450.32. Its structural formula is:</p><p></p><p>Tedizolid phosphate is a white to yellow solid and is administered orally or by intravenous infusion.</p><p>The pharmacologically active moiety, tedizolid, is an antibacterial agent of the oxazolidinone class.</p><p>Sivextro tablets contain 200 mg of tedizolid phosphate, and the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, crospovidone, povidone, and magnesium stearate. In addition, the film coating contains the following inactive ingredients: polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol/macrogol, talc, and yellow iron oxide.</p><p>Sivextro for injection is a sterile, white to off-white sterile lyophilized powder for injection in single-use vials of 200 mg. The inactive ingredients are mannitol (105 mg), sodium hydroxide, and hydrochloric acid, which is used in minimal quantities for pH adjustment.</p><h2>Sivextro - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Tedizolid phosphate is the prodrug of tedizolid, an antibacterial agent [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), (12.4)</span>].</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The AUC/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was shown to best correlate with tedizolid activity in animal infection models.</p><p>In the mouse thigh infection model of <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span>, antistaphylococcal killing activity was impacted by the presence of granulocytes. In granulocytopenic mice (neutrophil count &lt;100 cells/mL), bacterial stasis was achieved at a human-equivalent dose of approximately 2000 mg/day; whereas, in non-granulocytopenic animals, stasis was achieved at a human-equivalent dose of approximately 100 mg/day. The safety and efficacy of Sivextro for the treatment of neutropenic patients (neutrophil counts &lt;1000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>) have not been evaluated.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>In a randomized, positive- and placebo-controlled crossover thorough QTc study, 48 enrolled subjects were administered a single oral dose of Sivextro at a therapeutic dose of 200 mg, Sivextro at a supratherapeutic dose of 1200 mg, placebo, and a positive control; no significant effects of Sivextro on heart rate, electrocardiogram morphology, PR, QRS, or QT interval were detected. Therefore, Sivextro does not affect cardiac repolarization.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Tedizolid phosphate is a prodrug that is converted by phosphatases to tedizolid, the microbiologically active moiety, following oral and intravenous administration. Only the pharmacokinetic profile of tedizolid is discussed further due to negligible systemic exposure of tedizolid phosphate following oral and intravenous administration. Following multiple once-daily oral or intravenous administration, steady-state concentrations are achieved within approximately three days with tedizolid accumulation of approximately 30% (tedizolid half-life of approximately 12 hours). Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of tedizolid following oral and intravenous administration of 200 mg once daily tedizolid phosphate are shown in Table 4.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Peak plasma tedizolid concentrations are achieved within approximately 3 hours following oral administration under fasting conditions or at the end of the 1 hour intravenous infusion of tedizolid phosphate. The absolute bioavailability is approximately 91% and no dosage adjustment is necessary between intravenous and oral administration.</p><p>Tedizolid phosphate (oral) may be administered with or without food as total systemic exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span>) is unchanged between fasted and fed (high-fat, high-calorie) conditions.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Protein binding of tedizolid to human plasma proteins is approximately 70 to 90%. The mean steady state volume of distribution of tedizolid in healthy adults following a single intravenous dose of tedizolid phosphate 200 mg ranged from 67 to 80 L (approximately twice total body water). Tedizolid penetrates into the interstitial space fluid of adipose and skeletal muscle tissue with exposure similar to free drug exposure in plasma.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Other than tedizolid, which accounts for approximately 95% of the total radiocarbon AUC in plasma, there are no other significant circulating metabolites in humans.</p><p>There was no degradation of tedizolid in human liver microsomes indicating tedizolid is unlikely to be a substrate for hepatic CYP450 enzymes.</p><p>In vitro studies showed that conjugation of tedizolid is mediated via multiple sulfotransferase (SULT) isoforms (SULT1A1, SULT1A2, and SULT2A1).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>Following single oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled tedizolid phosphate under fasted conditions, the majority of elimination occurred via the liver, with 82% of the radioactive dose recovered in feces and 18% in urine, primarily as a non-circulating and microbiologically inactive sulfate conjugate. Most of the elimination of tedizolid (&gt;85%) occurs within 96 hours. Less than 3% of the tedizolid phosphate-administered dose is excreted in feces and urine as unchanged tedizolid.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there are no clinically relevant demographic or clinical patient factors (including age, gender, race, ethnicity, weight, body mass index, and measures of renal or liver function) that impact the pharmacokinetics of tedizolid.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Following administration of a single 200 mg oral dose of Sivextro, no clinically meaningful changes in mean tedizolid C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-</span><span class="Sub">∞</span> were observed in patients with moderate (n=8) or severe (n=8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B and C) compared to 8 matched healthy control subjects. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Following administration of a single 200 mg intravenous dose of Sivextro to 8 subjects with severe renal impairment defined as eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> was essentially unchanged and AUC<span class="Sub">0-</span><span class="Sub">∞</span> was decreased by less than 10% compared to 8 matched healthy control subjects. Hemodialysis does not result in meaningful removal of tedizolid from systemic circulation, as assessed in subjects with end-stage renal disease (eGFR &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>). No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment or patients on hemodialysis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Geriatric Patients</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of tedizolid were evaluated in a Phase 1 study conducted in elderly healthy volunteers (age 65 years and older, with at least 5 subjects at least 75 years old; n=14) compared to younger control subjects (25 to 45 years old; n=14) following administration of a single oral dose of Sivextro 200 mg. There were no clinically meaningful differences in tedizolid C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-</span><span class="Sub">∞</span> between elderly subjects and younger control subjects. No dosage adjustment of Sivextro is necessary in elderly patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Gender</span></p><p>The impact of gender on the pharmacokinetics of Sivextro was evaluated in clinical trials of healthy males and females and in a population pharmacokinetics analysis. The pharmacokinetics of tedizolid were similar in males and females.

No clinically relevant interactions are expected to occur with these transporters except BCRP. Coadministration of multiple oral doses of Sivextro (200 mg once daily) increased the Cmax and AUC of rosuvastatin (10 mg single oral dose), a known BCRP substrate, by approximately 55% and 70%, respectively, in healthy subjects [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Monoamine Oxidase Inhibition</span></p><p>Tedizolid is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. The interaction with MAO inhibitors could not be evaluated in Phase 2 and 3 trials, as subjects taking such medications were excluded from the trials.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Adrenergic Agents</span></p><p>Two placebo-controlled crossover studies were conducted to assess the potential of 200 mg oral Sivextro at steady state to enhance pressor responses to pseudoephedrine and tyramine in healthy individuals. No meaningful changes in blood pressure or heart rate were seen with pseudoephedrine. The median tyramine dose required to cause an increase in systolic blood pressure of ≥30 mmHg from pre-dose baseline was 325 mg with Sivextro compared to 425 mg with placebo. Palpitations were reported in 21/29 (72.4%) subjects exposed to Sivextro compared to 13/28 (46.4%) exposed to placebo in the tyramine challenge study.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Serotonergic Agents</span></p><p>Serotonergic effects at doses of tedizolid phosphate up to 30-fold above the human equivalent dose did not differ from vehicle control in a mouse model that predicts serotonergic activity. In Phase 3 trials, subjects taking serotonergic agents including antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1) receptor agonists (triptans), meperidine, or buspirone were excluded.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">Tedizolid belongs to the oxazolidinone class of antibacterial drugs.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>The antibacterial activity of tedizolid is mediated by binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis. Tedizolid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis through a mechanism of action different from that of other non-oxazolidinone class antibacterial drugs; therefore, cross-resistance between tedizolid and other classes of antibacterial drugs is unlikely.

At least 90% of the following microorganisms exhibit an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to 0.5 mcg/mL for tedizolid. However, the safety and effectiveness of Sivextro in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Aerobic and Facultative Anaerobic Gram-positive Bacteria</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Susceptibility Test Methods</span></p><p>When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative results of the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an effective antibacterial drug for treatment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Dilution Techniques</span></p><p>Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs).

The standardized procedure requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations.<span class="Sup">2, 3</span> This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 20 mcg tedizolid to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to tedizolid. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 20 mcg tedizolid disk should be interpreted according to the criteria in Table 5.</p><p>A report of "Susceptible" indicates that the antimicrobial drug is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial drug reaches the concentration usually achievable at the site of infection. A report of "Intermediate" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical efficacy in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of "Resistant" indicates that the antimicrobial drug is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial drug reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Quality Control</span></p><p>Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test.<span class="Sup">1, 2, 3</span> Standardized tedizolid powder should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 6.

Tedizolid, generated from tedizolid phosphate after metabolic activation (<span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>), was also tested for genotoxicity. Tedizolid was positive in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> CHL cell chromosomal aberration assay, but negative for genotoxicity in other <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assays (Ames, mouse lymphoma mutagenicity) and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in a mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.</p><p>In a fertility study, oral tedizolid phosphate had no adverse effects on the fertility or reproductive performance, including spermatogenesis, of male rats at the maximum tested dose (50 mg/kg/day) with a plasma tedizolid AUC approximately 5-fold greater than the plasma AUC value in humans at the oral therapeutic dose. Tedizolid phosphate also had no adverse effects on the fertility or reproductive performance of adult female rats at doses up to the maximum tested (15 mg/kg/day). Plasma tedizolid exposure (AUC) at this NOAEL in female rats was approximately 4-fold higher than that in humans at the oral therapeutic dose.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Repeated-oral and intravenous dosing of tedizolid phosphate in rats in 1-month and 3-month toxicology studies produced dose- and time-dependent bone marrow hypocellularity (myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocyte), with associated reduction in circulating RBCs, WBCs, and platelets. These effects showed evidence of reversibility and occurred at plasma tedizolid exposure levels (AUC) ≥6-fold greater than the plasma exposure associated with the human therapeutic dose. In a 1-month immunotoxicology study in rats, repeated oral dosing of tedizolid phosphate was shown to significantly reduce splenic B cells and T cells and reduce plasma IgG titers. These effects occurred at plasma tedizolid exposure levels (AUC) ≥3-fold greater than the expected human plasma exposure associated with the therapeutic dose.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections</h3><p class="First">A total of 1333 adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) were randomized in two multicenter, multinational, double-blind, non-inferiority trials. Both trials compared Sivextro 200 mg once daily for 6 days versus linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. In Trial 1, patients were treated with oral therapy, while in Trial 2, patients could receive oral therapy after a minimum of one day of intravenous therapy. Patients with cellulitis/erysipelas, major cutaneous abscess, or wound infection were enrolled in the trials. Patients with wound infections could have received aztreonam and/or metronidazole as adjunctive therapy for gram-negative bacterial coverage, if needed. The intent-to-treat (ITT) patient population included all randomized patients.</p><p>In Trial 1, 332 patients with ABSSSI were randomized to Sivextro and 335 patients were randomized to linezolid. The majority (91%) of patients treated with Sivextro in Trial 1 were less than 65 years old with a median age of 43 years (range: 18 to 86 years). Patients treated with Sivextro were predominantly male (61%) and White (84%); 13% had BMI ≥35 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, 8% had diabetes mellitus, 35% were current or recent intravenous drug users, and 2% had moderate to severe renal impairment. The overall median surface area of infection was 188 cm<span class="Sup">2</span>. The types of ABSSSI included were cellulitis/erysipelas (41%), wound infection (29%), and major cutaneous abscess (30%). In addition to local signs and symptoms of infection, patients were also required to have at least one regional or systemic sign of infection at baseline, defined as lymphadenopathy (87% of patients), temperature 38°C or higher (16% of patients), white blood cell count greater than 10,000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> or less than 4000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> (42%), or 10% or more band forms on white blood cell differential (4%).</p><p>The primary endpoint in Trial 1 was early clinical response defined as no increase from baseline lesion area at 48-72 hours after the first dose and oral temperature of ≤37.6°C, confirmed by a second temperature measurement within 24 hours in the ITT population.</p><p>In Trial 2, 332 patients with ABSSSI were randomized to Sivextro and 334 patients were randomized to linezolid. The majority (87%) of patients treated with Sivextro in Trial 2 were less than 65 years old with a median age of 46 years (range: 17 to 86 years).

Sivextro does not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Sivextro is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Sivextro or other antibacterial drugs in the future [<span class="Italics">see Indications and Usage (1.2)</span>].</p><p>Patients should be informed that if they miss a dose, they should take the dose as soon as possible anytime up to 8 hours prior to their next scheduled dose. If less than 8 hours remains before the next dose, then they should wait until their next scheduled dose. Patients should take the prescribed number of doses [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.1)</span>].</p><p>Keep Sivextro and all medications out of reach of children.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Potentially Serious Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Patients should be advised that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs including Sivextro and usually resolves when the drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop frequent watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic and may be a sign of a more serious intestinal infection [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and</span> <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>]. If this occurs, patients should contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible.</p><p class="First">Manuf. for: Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of<br/>
