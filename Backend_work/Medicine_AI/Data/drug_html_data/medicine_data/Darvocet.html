Propoxyphene is in a group of drugs called narcotic pain relievers. Acetaminophen is a less potent pain reliever and a fever reducer that increases the effects of propoxyphene.</p><p>Darvocet is used to relieve mild to moderate pain with or without fever.</p><p>Darvocet may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Darvocet was withdrawn from the U.S. market in November 2010.</b></p><p>Propoxyphene may be habit-forming and should be used only by the person it was prescribed for. Keep the medication in a secure place where others cannot get to it. Do not use Darvocet if you have taken an MAO inhibitor such as furazolidone (Furoxone), isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), rasagiline (Azilect), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam), or tranylcypromine (Parnate) in the last 14 days. Serious, life threatening side effects can occur if you use Darvocet before the MAO inhibitor has cleared from your body.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Do not use Darvocet if you are allergic to acetaminophen (Tylenol) or propoxyphene.

It is not known whether Darvocet is harmful to an unborn baby, but it could cause breathing problems or addiction/withdrawal symptoms in a newborn. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment. Acetaminophen and propoxyphene can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. Do not use Darvocet without telling your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take Darvocet?</h2><p>Take Darvocet exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain.</p><p>An overdose of acetaminophen can damage your liver. Adults should not take more than 1 gram (1000 mg) of acetaminophen per dose or 4 grams (4000 mg) per day. If you drink more than three alcoholic beverages per day, you should never use more than 2 grams (2000 mg) of acetaminophen per day. Do not stop using Darvocet suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to avoid withdrawal symptoms when you stop using Darvocet. If you need surgery, tell the surgeon ahead of time that you are using acetaminophen and propoxyphene. You may need to stop using the medicine for a short time.</p><p>Store Darvocet at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep track of the amount of medicine used from each new bottle. Propoxyphene is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Darvocet is taken as needed, you may not be on a dosing schedule.

Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be alert. Ask a doctor or pharmacist before using any other cold, allergy, pain, or sleep medication.
