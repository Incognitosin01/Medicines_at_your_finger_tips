Try to stay on your schedule of inserting and removing the ring.</p><p>Do not leave the ring out of the vagina for longer than a total of 2 hours during the 21-day wearing time.</p><p>If a ring falls out, wash it with mild soap and warm water, pat dry with a clean cloth, and reinsert it.</p><p>You may need to use back-up birth control (condoms or spermicide, but not a female condom) for 7 days in a row:</p><ul>
