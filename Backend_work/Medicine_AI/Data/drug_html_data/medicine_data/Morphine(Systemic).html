Maximize nonopioid analgesia, if appropriate, prior to initiation of opioid analgesia (CDC [Dowell 2016]; Hill 2018). Dosing provided is based on typical doses and some patients may require higher or lower doses. Individualize dosing and dosing intervals based on patient-specific factors (eg, comorbidities, severity of pain, concomitant medications, general condition, degree of opioid experience/tolerance) and titrate to patient-specific treatment goals (eg, improvement in function and quality of life, decrease in pain using a validated pain rating scale). Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time. For acute non-cancer-related pain severe enough to require an opioid, utilize multimodal pain control, maximize nonopioid analgesics, and limit the quantity prescribed to the expected duration of acute pain; a quantity sufficient for ≤3 days is often adequate, whereas &gt;7 days is rarely needed. Do not use long-acting preparations for treatment of acute pain in opioid-naive patients (APS 2016; CDC [Dowell 2016]). Before starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, establish realistic goals for pain and function, and consider how therapy will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks (CDC [Dowell 2016]).</p><p><b>Acute pain:</b></p><p><b><i>General dosing:</i></b><b> Note: </b>Dosing presented in this section is for opioid-naive patients.

May give up to 30 mg every 4 hours as needed for severe, acute pain in hospitalized patients at low risk for respiratory depression (APS 2016; Herzig 2019; Pharmacist’s Letter [Cupp 2012]; manufacturer's labeling).</p><p><b>IV:</b> Opioid-naive patients:</p><p><i>Intermittent:</i> Initial: 1 to 4 mg every 1 to 4 hours as needed; if pain is not relieved, may increase dose as tolerated.

For some severe acute pain episodes (eg, trauma), may initially give more frequently (eg, every 5 to 15 minutes) if needed and titrate to pain relief; once pain relief is achieved, reduce frequency (eg, every 3 to 4 hours as needed) (Lvovschi 2008; Patanwala 2010). <b>Note:</b> When IV access is not available, SubQ administration using similar dosing may be considered; however, repeated intermittent SubQ injections cause local tissue irritation, pain, and induration and are not recommended (Mariano 2019).</p><p><i>Patient-controlled analgesia (Mariano 2019): </i></p><p><sup>a</sup>For use to maintain pain control after initial pain control achieved.

If patient-controlled analgesia is needed, refer to <b>Example IV </b><b>Patient-Controlled Analgesia<b> Initial Dose Ranges for Opioid-Naive Patients </b></b>table.</p><p><b><i>Sickle cell disease, vaso-occlusive pain</i></b><b>: </b></p><p><b>Note:</b> Dosing presented is for patients in emergency department and hospital settings (including day hospitals) whose previous opioid dose for prior episodes is unknown or who rarely require opioids for pain management. If opioid dose given for a prior episode is known, choose initial dose based on intensity of pain in comparison with previous episode and previous effective dose (DeBaun 2020).</p><p><b>IV:</b> Initial: 0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg (maximum initial dose: 10 mg) given once within 30 minutes of presentation, reassess pain within 20 minutes; if continued severe pain, may repeat with doses of 0.02 to 0.05 mg/kg every 20 to 30 minutes to achieve pain relief (DeBaun 2020). If IV access is difficult, may administer SubQ (NIH 2014). If pain relief is not achieved after ≥3 doses, hospitalization for around-the-clock parenteral analgesics is generally indicated. Evaluate need for long-acting opioid; if patient usually requires a long-acting opioid at home, may convert to oral home regimen once IV dose is roughly equivalent to long-acting opioid dose (DeBaun 2020).</p><p><b>Chronic pain, including chronic cancer pain:</b></p><p><b>Note: </b>Opioids, including morphine, are <b>not </b>the preferred therapy for chronic noncancer pain due to insufficient evidence of benefit and risk of serious harm; nonpharmacologic treatment and nonopioid analgesics are preferred, with the exception of chronic pain from sickle cell disease and end-of-life care. Opioids, including morphine, should <b>only</b> be considered in patients who experience clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function that outweighs patient safety risks (CDC [Dowell 2016; Dowell 2019]).</p><p><i>Opioid-naive patients:</i> In general, for noncancer pain, morphine requirement should be established using IR formulations (CDC [Dowell 2016]). With cancer pain, may switch to a long-acting formulation earlier in the course of therapy (Portenoy 2019).</p><p><b>Oral: Immediate release:</b> Oral solution, Tablet: <b>Note:</b> The 100 mg/5 mL (or 20 mg/mL) concentrated oral solution is not intended for opioid-naive patients.</p><p><i>Noncancer or cancer pain: </i>Initial: 5 to 30 mg every 4 hours as needed or scheduled around the clock for some patients (eg, cancer pain) (Paice 2011; Pharmacist’s Letter [Cupp 2012]; Portenoy 2019; Rosenquist 2019). For chronic noncancer pain, most patients will have pain control with initial doses &lt;50 mg/day (Busse 2017).</p><p>Titration: For chronic noncancer pain, may increase the dose slowly in increments of no more than 25% to 50% of the total daily dose (Rosenquist 2019). For chronic cancer pain, may increase the fixed scheduled dose by 30% to 100% of the total dose taken in the prior 24-hour period, while taking into consideration the total amount of rescue medication used; if pain score decreased, continue current effective dosing (Paice 2011; Portenoy 2019). <b>Note:</b> In order to reduce risk of overdose, use caution when increasing opioid dosage to ≥50 MME/day and avoid increasing dosage to ≥90 MME/day or carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to ≥90 MME/day (CDC [Dowell 2016]).</p><p><b>IV, SubQ: Note: </b>Typically reserved for acute exacerbations or those who cannot tolerate oral administration. For progressive illnesses (eg, cancer), a continuous IV or SubQ infusion, with or without a patient-controlled analgesia option, can also be used as pain requirements increase. In general, SubQ dose is equivalent to IV dose (Anderson 2004). Individualize dose based on patient’s previous opioid intake and appropriate opioid analgesic equivalents; titrate further, if needed, based on level of pain.</p><p><i>Noncancer or cancer pain: </i>IV: Initial: 2 to 5 mg every 2 to 4 hours as needed (Portenoy 2019).</p><p><i>Cancer pain or palliative care: </i>SubQ: Initial: 2 to 5 mg every 3 to 4 hours as needed (Portenoy 2019). If a continuous SubQ infusion is employed, refer to institutional protocols; reported dosing varies greatly and is based on practice and patient needs (Anderson 2004; Koshy 2005; Portenoy 2019; Walsh 2006).</p><p><i>Opioid-tolerant patients (also refer to the section <b>Dose conversions for pain management</b>):</i></p><p><b>Oral: Extended release:</b></p><p><b>Note:</b> Although manufacturer's labeling contains directions for initiating ER morphine products in opioid-naive patients with chronic pain, these preparations should not be used as initial therapy. Instead, treatment should be initiated with an IR preparation to more accurately determine the daily opioid requirement and decrease the risk of overdose. Unless pain is associated with cancer, palliative care, or sickle cell disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that ER opioids be reserved for patients who have received IR opioids daily for ≥1 week yet continue to experience severe, continuous pain (CDC [Dowell 2016]).</p><p><i>Capsules, extended release (Kadian):</i> See <b>Dose conversions for pain management</b>: Calculated dose may be administered once daily or in 2 equally divided doses administered every 12 hours; may consider dose reduction with first several doses when converting from IR formulations.

Dose adjustments may be made as frequently as every 1 to 2 days.</p><p><b>Dose conversions for pain management:</b> <b>Note:</b> Equianalgesic conversions serve only as a general guide to estimate opioid dose equivalents. Multiple factors must be considered for safely individualizing conversion of opioid analgesia. In general, for noncancer pain, the decision to convert from an IR to an ER formulation should be individualized and reserved for those with severe continuous pain who have been taking opioids for ≥1 week (Rosenquist 2019).</p><p><i>Converting from oral morphine to parenteral morphine: </i></p><p>Approximate equivalency: 30 mg (<b>oral</b> morphine): 10 mg<i> (</i><b>IV/SubQ</b> morphine) (Pharmacist’s Letter [Cupp 2012]).</p><p><i>Converting from oral IR morphine to oral ER morphine preparations:</i></p><p><b>Arymo ER, MorphaBond ER, MS Contin:</b> Total daily oral morphine dose may be administered either in 2 divided doses (every 12 hours) <b>or</b> in 3 divided doses (every 8 hours).</p><p><b>Kadian:</b> Total daily oral morphine dose administered once daily; in patients experiencing inadequate analgesia with once-daily dosing, total daily dose can be administered in 2 divided doses (every 12 hours).</p><p><i>Converting from oral morphine to rectal morphine: </i></p><p>Although the bioavailability of rectal morphine is believed to approximate oral morphine (ie, 1:1), absorption is variable and may be higher or lower than expected. Therefore, when switching from oral to rectal dosing, a reduction in rectal dose may be necessary (Brokjær 2015; Portenoy 2019).</p><p><i>Converting to/from morphine (parenteral or oral) to/from a different opioid (parenteral or oral):</i></p><p>Refer to published equianalgesic opioid conversion data for guidance (or refer to institutional protocols).

An optimal tapering schedule has not been established (CDC [Dowell 2016]). Proposed schedules range from slow (eg, 10% reduction per week) to rapid (eg, 25% to 50% reduction every few days) (CDC 2015). Individualize to minimize withdrawal while considering patient-specific goals and concerns as well as the opioid’s pharmacokinetics. Slower tapers may be appropriate after long-term use (eg, years), particularly in the final stage of tapering, whereas more rapid tapers may be appropriate in patients experiencing severe adverse effects (CDC [Dowell 2016]). Monitor carefully for signs/symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient displays withdrawal symptoms, consider slowing the taper schedule; alterations may include increasing the interval between dose reductions, decreasing amount of daily dose reduction, pausing the taper and restarting when the patient is ready, and/or coadministration of an alpha-2 agonist (eg, clonidine) to blunt withdrawal symptoms (Berna 2015; CDC [Dowell 2016]). Continue to offer nonopioid analgesics as needed for pain management during the taper; consider nonopioid adjunctive treatments for withdrawal symptoms (eg, GI complaints, muscle spasm) as needed (Berna 2015; Sevarino 2019).</p><p><b>Neuraxial analgesia:</b></p><p><b>Epidural</b>:</p><p><b>Note: </b>Reserve use for severe pain (eg, after surgery, cancer pain).

Single-dose Duramorph neuraxial administration may result in acute or delayed respiratory depression for up to 24 hours. Monitor patients receiving Infumorph or Mitigo, as appropriate, for the first several days after catheter implantation.</p><p>Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or nonprescription products that contain alcohol while taking morphine extended-release (ER) capsules. The coingestion of alcohol with morphine ER may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of morphine.</p><p>Morphine exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing morphine and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions.</p><p>To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the FDA has required a REMS for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS compliant education programs available to health care providers. Health care providers are strongly encouraged to complete a REMS-compliant education program; counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products; emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacist; and consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety.</p><p>Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of morphine. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of morphine or following a dose increase. Swallow morphine ER formulations whole. ER capsule contents may be sprinkled on applesauce and swallowed immediately without chewing. Crushing, chewing, or dissolving the tablets or contents within the capsule can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine. Because of delay in maximum CNS effect with IV administration (30 minutes), rapid IV administration may result in overdosing.

Some dosage forms may be contraindicated in patients with severe CNS depression.</p><p>• Constipation: May cause constipation which may be problematic in patients with unstable angina and patients post-myocardial infarction. Consider preventive measures (eg, stool softener, increased fiber) to reduce the potential for constipation.</p><p>• Hypotension: May cause severe hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension and syncope); use with caution in patients with hypovolemia, cardiovascular disease (including acute MI), circulatory shock, or drugs that may exaggerate hypotensive effects (including phenothiazines or general anesthetics). Monitor for symptoms of hypotension following initiation or dose titration. Avoid use in patients with circulatory shock. Some dosage forms may be contraindicated in patients with cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure due to chronic lung disease.</p><p>• Phenanthrene hypersensitivity: Use with caution in patients with hypersensitivity reactions to other phenanthrene derivative opioid agonists (codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, levorphanol, oxycodone, oxymorphone).</p><p>• Respiratory depression: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely for respiratory depression, especially during initiation or dose escalation. Swallow morphine ER formulations whole (or may sprinkle the contents of the capsule on applesauce and swallow without chewing); crushing, chewing, or dissolving the ER formulations can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine.</b> Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Patients and caregivers should be educated on how to recognize respiratory depression and the importance of getting emergency assistance immediately (eg, calling 911) in the event of known or suspected overdose.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Abdominal conditions: May obscure diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.</p><p>• Adrenocortical insufficiency: Use with caution in patients with adrenal insufficiency, including Addison disease. Long-term opioid use may cause secondary hypogonadism, which may lead to sexual dysfunction, infertility, mood disorders, and osteoporosis (Brennan 2013).</p><p>• Biliary tract impairment: Use with caution in patients with biliary tract dysfunction or acute pancreatitis; opioids may cause constriction of sphincter of Oddi.</p><p>• CNS depression/coma: Avoid use in patients with impaired consciousness or coma, as these patients are susceptible to intracranial effects of CO<sub>2</sub> retention.</p><p>• Delirium tremens: Use with caution in patients with delirium tremens. Some dosage forms may be contraindicated in patients with delirium tremens.</p><p>• Head trauma: Use with extreme caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or elevated intracranial pressure (ICP); exaggerated elevation of ICP may occur. Some dosage forms may be contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial or cerebrospinal pressure, head injuries, or brain tumor.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment.</p><p>• Mental health conditions: Use opioids with caution for chronic pain in patients with mental health conditions (eg, depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder) due to increased risk for opioid use disorder and overdose; more frequent monitoring is recommended (CDC [Dowell 2016]).</p><p>• Obesity: Use with caution in patients who are morbidly obese.</p><p>• Prostatic hyperplasia/urinary stricture: Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia and/or urinary stricture.</p><p>• Psychosis: Use with caution in patients with toxic psychosis.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment.</p><p>• Respiratory disease: Use with caution and monitor for respiratory depression in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercarbia, or preexisting respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating therapy; critical respiratory depression may occur, even at therapeutic dosages. Consider the use of alternative nonopioid analgesics in these patients.</p><p>• Sleep-related disorders: Opioid use increases the risk for sleep-related disorders (eg, central sleep apnea [CSA], hypoxemia) in a dose-dependent fashion. Use with caution for chronic pain and titrate dosage cautiously in patients with risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing (eg, heart failure, obesity). Consider dose reduction in patients presenting with CSA. Avoid opioids in patients with moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing (CDC [Dowell 2016]).</p><p>• Seizure disorders: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders; may cause or exacerbate preexisting seizures. Some dosage forms may be contraindicated in patients with seizure disorder.</p><p>• Thyroid dysfunction: Use with caution in patients with thyroid dysfunction.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants: [<b>US Boxed Warning]: Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of morphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosage and durations to the minimum required and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</b> Some dosage forms may be contraindicated in patients with acute alcoholism. Consider prescribing naloxone for emergency treatment of opioid overdose in patients taking benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants concomitantly with opioids.</p><p>• Ethanol use: Extended-release capsules:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Patients should not consume alcoholic beverages or medication containing ethanol while taking ER capsules; ethanol may increase morphine plasma levels, resulting in a potentially fatal overdose.</b></p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Cachectic or debilitated patients: Use with caution in cachectic or debilitated patients; there is a greater potential for critical respiratory depression, even at therapeutic dosages. Consider the use of alternative nonopioid analgesics in these patients.</p><p>• Elderly: Use with caution in elderly patients; may be more sensitive to adverse effects, including life-threatening respiratory depression. Decrease initial dose. In the setting of chronic pain, monitor closely due to an increased potential for risks, including certain risks such as falls/fracture, cognitive impairment, and constipation. Clearance may also be reduced in older adults (with or without renal impairment) resulting in a narrow therapeutic window and increasing the risk for respiratory depression or overdose (CDC [Dowell 2016]). Consider the use of alternative nonopioid analgesics in these patients.</p><p>• Neonates: Neonatal withdrawal syndrome: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Prolonged maternal use of opioids during pregnancy can cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome in the newborn, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If prolonged opioid therapy is required in a pregnant woman, ensure treatment is available and warn patient of risk to the neonate.</b> Signs and symptoms include irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep pattern, high-pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. Onset, duration, and severity depend on the drug used, duration of use, maternal dose, and rate of drug elimination by the newborn.</p><p>• Pediatric: Infants &lt;3 months of age, especially if premature, are more susceptible to respiratory depression and/or apnea; use with caution and generally in reduced doses in this age group (APS 2008).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Infumorph, Duramorph, Mitigo: Neuroaxial administration: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: </b><b>Because of the risk of severe adverse effects when the epidural or intrathecal route of administration is employed, patients must be observed in a fully equipped and staffed environment for at least 24 hours after the initial dose. Single-dose Duramorph neuraxial administration may result in acute or delayed respiratory depression for up to 24 hours. Monitor patients receiving Infumorph or Mitigo for the first several days after catheter implantation. </b>Naloxone injection should be immediately available. Thoracic epidural administration has been shown to dramatically increase the risk of early and late respiratory depression. High doses (&gt; 20 mg/day) of neuraxial morphine may produce myoclonic events. Patients with reduced circulating blood volume or impaired myocardial function, or on concomitant sympatholytic drugs should be monitored for orthostatic hypotension, a frequent complication in single-dose neuraxial morphine.</p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; CDC, 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol derivative with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p>• Extended-release formulations: Therapy should only be prescribed by health care professionals familiar with the use of potent opioids for chronic pain. Extended-release products are not interchangeable. When determining a generic equivalent or switching from one extended-release product to another, a thorough understanding of the pharmacokinetic properties is important in determining the proper generic equivalent or proper dose of the other extended-release product (review of the manufacturer's label may be necessary).</p><p>-<i> Arymo ER: </i>Moistened tablets may become sticky, leading to difficulty in swallowing the tablets; choking, gagging, regurgitation, and tablets getting stuck in the throat may occur. Tablet stickiness and swelling may also predispose patients to intestinal obstruction and exacerbation of diverticulitis. Do not to pre-soak, lick, or otherwise wet tablets prior to placing in the mouth; take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing. Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small GI lumen (eg, esophageal cancer, colon cancer).</p><p>• Oral solution: Risk of medication errors: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: </b><b>Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering morphine oral solution. Dosing errors due to confusion between mg and mL, and other morphine solutions of different concentrations, can result in accidental overdose and death.</b> The 100 mg per 5 mL (20 mg/mL) is for use in opioid-tolerant patients only.</p><p>• Injections: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: </b><b>Because of delay in maximum CNS effect with IV administration (30 minutes), rapid IV administration may result in overdosing. Observe patients in a fully equipped and staffed environment for at least 24 hours after each test dose of Infumorph or Mitigo and, as indicated, for the first several days after surgery. </b> Products are designed for administration by specific routes (ie, IV, intrathecal, epidural). Use caution when prescribing, dispensing, or administering to use formulations only by intended route(s). Rapid IV administration may result in chest wall rigidity. Use with caution when injecting IM into chilled areas or in patients with hypotension or shock (impaired perfusion may prevent complete absorption); if repeated injections are administered, an excessive amount may be suddenly absorbed if normal circulation is re-established.</p><p>• Infumorph, Mitigo: Should only be used in microinfusion devices; not for IV, IM, or SubQ administration or for single-dose administration. Administer intrathecal doses of 10 and 25 mg/mL to the lumbar area. Monitor closely, especially in the first 24 hours. Inflammatory masses (eg, granulomas), some resulting in severe neurologic impairment, have occurred when receiving Infumorph or Mitigo via indwelling intrathecal catheter; monitor carefully for new neurologic signs/symptoms.</p><p>• Product interchange: Improper or erroneous substitution of Infumorph or Mitigo for regular Duramorph is likely to result in serious overdosage, leading to seizures, respiratory depression, and possibly a fatal outcome.</p><p>• Sulfites: Some dosage forms may contain sulfites that may cause allergic reactions in sulfite sensitive patients.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Abrupt discontinuation/withdrawal: Abrupt discontinuation in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has been associated with serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, attempts to find other opioids (including illicit), and suicide. Use a collaborative, patient-specific taper schedule that minimizes the risk of withdrawal, considering factors such as current opioid dose, duration of use, type of pain, and physical and psychological factors. Monitor pain control, withdrawal symptoms, mood changes, suicidal ideation, and for use of other substances; provide care as needed. Concurrent use of mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol) or partial agonist (eg, buprenorphine) analgesics may also precipitate withdrawal symptoms and/or reduced analgesic efficacy in patients following prolonged therapy with mu opioid agonists.</p><p>• Abuse/misuse/diversion: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Morphine exposes patients and other users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, potentially leading to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing; monitor all patients regularly for development of these behaviors or conditions.</b> Use with caution in patients with a history of drug abuse or acute alcoholism; potential for drug dependency exists. Other factors associated with increased risk include younger age, concomitant depression (major), and psychotropic medication use. Consider offering naloxone prescriptions in patients with factors associated with an increased risk for overdose, such as history of overdose or substance use disorder, higher opioid dosages (≥50 morphine milligram equivalents/day orally), and concomitant benzodiazepine use (CDC [Dowell 2016]).</p><p>• Accidental exposure: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Accidental ingestion of even one dose, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of morphine.</b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Chronic pain (outside of end-of-life or palliative care, active cancer treatment, sickle cell disease, or medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder) in outpatient setting in adults: Opioids should <b>not</b> be used as first-line therapy for chronic pain management (pain &gt;3-month duration or beyond time of normal tissue healing) due to limited short-term benefits, undetermined long-term benefits, and association with serious risks (eg, overdose, MI, auto accidents, risk of developing opioid use disorder). Preferred management includes nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid therapy (eg, NSAIDS, acetaminophen, certain anticonvulsants and antidepressants). If opioid therapy is initiated, it should be combined with nonpharmacologic and nonopioid therapy, as appropriate. Prior to initiation, known risks of opioid therapy should be discussed and realistic treatment goals for pain/function should be established, including consideration for discontinuation if benefits do not outweigh risks. Therapy should be continued only if clinically meaningful improvement in pain/function outweighs risks. Therapy should be initiated at the lowest effective dosage using immediate-release opioids (instead of extended-release/long-acting opioids). Risk associated with use increases with higher opioid dosages. Risks and benefits should be re-evaluated when increasing dosage to ≥50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day orally; dosages ≥90 MME/day orally should be avoided unless carefully justified (CDC [Dowell 2016]).</p><p>• Naloxone access: Discuss the availability of naloxone with all patients who are prescribed opioid analgesics, as well as their caregivers, and consider prescribing it to patients who are at increased risk of opioid overdose. These include patients who are also taking benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, have an opioid use disorder (OUD) (current or history of), or have experienced a previous opioid overdose. Additionally, health care providers should consider prescribing naloxone to patients prescribed medications to treat OUD; patients at risk of opioid overdose even if they are not taking an opioid analgesic or medication to treat OUD; and patients taking opioids, including methadone or buprenorphine for OUD, if they have household members, including children, or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. Inform patients and caregivers on options for obtaining naloxone (eg, by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, a community-based program) as permitted by state dispensing and prescribing guidelines. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression, proper administration of naloxone, and getting emergency help (FDA 2020).</p><p>• Optimal regimen: An opioid-containing analgesic regimen should be tailored to each patient's needs and based upon the type of pain being treated (acute versus chronic), the route of administration, degree of tolerance for opioids (naive versus chronic user), age, weight, and medical condition. The optimal analgesic dose varies widely among patients; doses should be titrated to pain relief/prevention.</p><p>• Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS): <b>[US Boxed Warning]: To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the FDA has required a REMS for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS compliant education programs available to health care providers. Health care providers are strongly encouraged to complete a REMS-compliant education program; counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products; emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacist; and consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety.</b></p><p>• Surgery: Opioids decrease bowel motility; monitor for decreased bowel motility in postop patients receiving opioids. Use with caution in the perioperative setting; individualize treatment when transitioning from parenteral to oral analgesics. Some dosage forms may be contraindicated after biliary tract surgery, suspected surgical abdomen, or surgical anastomosis.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Pain control, respiratory and mental status; blood pressure; signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction; signs or symptoms of hypogonadism or hypoadrenalism (Brennan 2013)</p><p>Alternate recommendations: Chronic pain (long-term therapy outside of end-of-life or palliative care, active cancer treatment, sickle cell disease, or medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder): Evaluate benefits/risks of opioid therapy within 1 to 4 weeks of treatment initiation and with dose increases. Re-evaluate benefits/risks every 3 months during therapy or more frequently in patients at increased risk of overdose or opioid use disorder. Urine drug testing is recommended prior to initiation and with consideration for re-checking at least yearly (includes controlled prescription medications and illicit drugs of abuse). State prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data should be reviewed by clinicians prior to initiation and periodically during therapy (frequency ranging from every prescription to every 3 months) (Dowell [CDC 2016]).</p><p>Critically ill: The Numeric Rating Scale should be used in patients who are able to self-report pain. In patients who are unable to self-report pain, the Behavioral Pain Scale and the Critical-Care Pain Observational Tool can be used in intubated or nonintubated patients (SCCM [Devlin 2018]).</p><p>Epidural/intrathecal: Patients should be observed in a fully equipped and staffed environment for at least 24 hours following initiation, and as appropriate for the first several days after catheter implantation. Naloxone injection should be immediately available. Patient should remain in this environment for at least 24 hours following the initial dose. For patients receiving Infumorph or Mitigo via microinfusion device, patient may be observed, as appropriate, for the first several days after catheter implantation.</p><p><b><i>Alternative monitoring recommendations</i></b> (Bujedo 2012): Epidural: <b>Note:</b> All patients receiving neuraxial opioids should be monitored for adequate ventilation (eg, respiratory rate, depth of respiration [without disturbing patient]), oxygenation (eg, pulse oximetry when appropriate), and level of consciousness.</p><p><i>Single dose:</i> Monitor patient for a minimum of 24 hours after administration with a frequency of at least once per hour for the first 12 hours after administration, followed by at least once every 2 hours for the next 12 hours (ie, from 12 to 24 hours after administration). After 24 hours, frequency dictated by overall clinical condition and concurrent medications.</p><p><i>Continuous infusion or patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA):</i> Monitor patient during the entire duration of the infusion with a frequency of at least once per hour for the first 12 hours, followed by at least once every 2 hours for the next 12 hours (ie, from 12 to 24 hours after administration). After 24 hours, monitor at least once every 4 hours. After discontinuation of infusion or PCEA, frequency dictated by overall clinical condition and concurrent medications.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Also refer to institution specific protocols as appropriate.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Long-term opioid use may cause secondary hypogonadism, which may lead to sexual dysfunction or infertility in men and women (Brennan 2013).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Morphine crosses the placenta.</p><p>According to some studies, maternal use of opioids may be associated with birth defects (including neural tube defects, congenital heart defects, and gastroschisis), poor fetal growth, stillbirth, and preterm delivery (CDC [Dowell 2016]). Opioids used as part of obstetric analgesia/anesthesia during labor and delivery may temporarily affect the fetal heart rate (ACOG 209 2019).</p><p><b>[US Boxed Warning]: </b><b>Prolonged use of morphine during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. </b>If chronic opioid exposure occurs in pregnancy, adverse events in the newborn (including withdrawal) may occur (Chou 2009). Symptoms of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) following opioid exposure may be autonomic (eg, fever, temperature instability), gastrointestinal (eg, diarrhea, vomiting, poor feeding/weight gain), or neurologic (eg, high-pitched crying, hyperactivity, increased muscle tone, increased wakefulness/abnormal sleep pattern, irritability, sneezing, seizure, tremor, yawning) (Dow 2012; Hudak 2012). Mothers who are physically dependent on opioids may give birth to infants who are also physically dependent. Opioids may cause respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in the neonate; newborns of mothers receiving opioids during labor should be monitored.</p><p>Morphine injection is commonly used for the treatment of pain during labor and immediately postpartum (ACOG 209 2019). Not all dosage forms are appropriate for this use. Agents other than morphine are used to treat chronic non-cancer pain in pregnant women or those who may become pregnant (CDC [Dowell 2016]; Chou 2009).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to ease pain.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
