Avoid use in patients with circulatory shock.</p><p>• Phenanthrene hypersensitivity: Use with caution in patients with hypersensitivity reactions to other phenanthrene derivative opioid agonists (codeine, hydromorphone, levorphanol, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone).</p><p>• Respiratory depression: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with hydrocodone. Monitor closely for respiratory depression, especially during initiation or when used in patients at higher risk</b> (including patients with chronic pulmonary disease, decreased respiratory reserve, altered pharmacokinetics or clearance and in patients taking concurrent drugs that may cause respiratory depression). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Abdominal conditions: May obscure diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions. Use with caution in patients with underlying intestinal motility disorders; may result in constipation or obstructive bowel disease. Use is contraindicated with known or suspected GI obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>• Adrenocortical insufficiency: Use with caution in patients with adrenal insufficiency, including Addison disease. Long-term opioid use may cause secondary hypogonadism, which may lead to mood disorders and osteoporosis (Brennan 2013).</p><p>• Biliary tract impairment: Use with caution in patients with biliary tract dysfunction or acute pancreatitis; opioids may cause constriction of sphincter of Oddi and increase biliary tract pressure.</p><p>• Delirium tremens: Use with caution in patients with delirium tremens.</p><p>• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes.</p><p>• Head trauma: Avoid use in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or elevated intracranial pressure (ICP); exaggerated elevation of ICP may occur.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment.</p><p>• Obesity: Use with caution in patients who are morbidly obese.</p><p>• Prostatic hyperplasia/urinary obstruction: Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia and/or urinary stricture.</p><p>• Psychosis: Use with caution in patients with toxic psychosis.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment.</p><p>• Respiratory disease: Use with caution and monitor for respiratory depression in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercarbia, or preexisting respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy; critical respiratory depression may occur, even at therapeutic dosages. Avoid use in patients with acute febrile illness associated with productive cough or in patients with chronic respiratory disease unable to clear secretions. Use is contraindicated in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or without resuscitative equipment.</p><p>• Seizure disorder: Use with caution in patients with a history of seizure disorder; may cause or exacerbate preexisting seizures.</p><p>• Thyroid dysfunction: Use with caution in patients with thyroid dysfunction.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Alcohol: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Patients should not consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or nonprescription products containing alcohol while taking hydrocodone/guaifenesin.

Avoid concomitant use in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.</b></p><p>• CYP3A4 interactions: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Concomitant use of hydrocodone/guaifenesin with all CYP3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in hydrocodone plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used CYP3A4 inducer may result in an increase in hydrocodone plasma concentration. Avoid use in patients taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer. </b>If concomitant use is necessary, monitor for signs and symptoms of toxicity or withdrawal.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Cachectic or debilitated patients: Use with caution in cachectic or debilitated patients; there is a greater potential for critical respiratory depression, even at therapeutic dosages.</p><p>• CYP2D6 "poor metabolizers": Due to the role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of hydrocodone to hydromorphone (an active metabolite with higher binding affinity to mu-opioid receptors compared to hydrocodone), patients with genetic variations of CYP2D6, including "poor metabolizers" or "extensive metabolizers," may have decreased or increased hydromorphone formation, respectively. Variable effects in positive and negative opioid effects have been reported in these patients; however, limited data exists to determine if clinically significant differences of analgesia and toxicity can be predicted based on CYP2D6 phenotype (Hutchinson 2004; Otton 1993; Zhou 2009).</p><p>• Elderly: Use with caution in elderly patients; may be more sensitive to adverse effects.</p><p>• Neonates: Neonatal withdrawal syndrome:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy can cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.</b>Signs and symptoms include irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high-pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight.
