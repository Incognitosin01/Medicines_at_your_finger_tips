</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Nuwiq</h2><p class="First">Nuwiq is a recombinant antihemophilic factor [blood coagulation factor VIII (Factor VIII)] indicated in adults and children with Hemophilia A for:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>On-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes</li>
<li>Perioperative management of bleeding</li>
<li>Routine prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes</li>
</ul><p>Nuwiq is not indicated for the treatment of von Willebrand Disease.</p><h2>Nuwiq Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For Intravenous use after reconstitution</span></p><h3>Dose</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Each vial of Nuwiq is labeled with the actual Factor VIII potency expressed in international units (IU). One IU of Factor VIII activity is defined by the quantity of Factor VIII in one mL of normal human pooled plasma. Calculation of the required dose of Factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU Factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma Factor VIII activity by approximately 2% of normal activity or 2 IU/dL when assessed using the one stage clotting assay. Use the following formulae to determine the required dose:</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>Dose and duration of therapy depend on the severity of the Factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of the bleeding, and the patient’s clinical condition.</li>

<li>single-use vial of Nuwiq concentrate</li>
<li>pre-filled syringe containing 2.5 mL Sterile Water for Injection</li>
<li>vial adapter</li>
<li>butterfly needle</li>
<li>two alcohol swabs.</li>
</ul><p>Do not refrigerate the solution after reconstitution. Use the solution within 3 hours after reconstitution. If solution is not used within this time period, close the filled syringe with the tamper-proof plastic tip, and discard.</p><h3>Administration</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For intravenous use after reconstitution only</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Nuwiq is available as a white, sterile, non-pyrogenic, lyophilized powder for reconstitution in single-use vials containing nominally 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 2500, 3000, or 4000 IU Factor VIII potency.</p><p>The actual Factor VIII potency is labeled on each Nuwiq vial.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Nuwiq is contraindicated in patients who have manifested life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to the product or its components.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible with Nuwiq. Early signs of hypersensitivity reactions that can progress to anaphylaxis may include angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, wheezing, urticaria, or pruritus. Immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate treatment if hypersensitivity reactions occur.</p><h3>Neutralizing Antibodies</h3><p class="First">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to Factor VIII can occur following the administration of Nuwiq. Monitor all patients for the development of Factor VIII inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the plasma Factor VIII level fails to increase as expected, or if bleeding is not controlled after Nuwiq administration, suspect the presence of an inhibitor (neutralizing antibody) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ].</p><h3>Monitoring and Laboratory Tests</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Monitor plasma Factor VIII activity by performing a validated test (e.g., one stage clotting assay), to confirm that adequate Factor VIII levels have been achieved and maintained [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ].</li>
<li>Monitor for the development of Factor VIII inhibitors. Perform a Bethesda inhibitor assay if expected Factor VIII plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with the expected dose of Nuwiq. Use Bethesda Units (BU) to report inhibitor levels.</li>
</ul><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most common adverse reactions (&gt;0.5% of subjects) reported in clinical trials were paresthesia, headache, injection site inflammation, injection site pain, non-neutralizing anti-Factor VIII antibody formation, back pain, vertigo, and dry mouth.</p><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rate in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety profile of Nuwiq was evaluated in five prospective, open-label clinical studies in previously treated patients (PTPs - exposed to a Factor VIII containing product for ≥150 exposure days (EDs) in the case of adolescents and adults or ≥50 EDs in the case of subjects below 12 years of age) with severe Hemophilia A (Factor VIII ≤ 1%). Subjects who had a history of detectable Factor VIII inhibitor, severe liver or kidney disease, were not immune competent (CD4+ count &lt;200/µL), or scheduled to receive immunomodulating drugs, were excluded.</p><p>Across all clinical studies, 135 patients were stratified, among them, 74 were adults, 3 adolescents between 12 and 17 years old, and 58 pediatric patients between 2 and 11 years old. A total of 127 (94.1%) subjects were treated for at least 180 days. Collectively, patients received between 24,005 and 996,550 IU (555 to 8629 IU/kg) from14 to 319 infusions over 14 to 299 exposure days, over a period of 33 to 563 days. An exposure day was defined as any day on which at least one infusion was started.</p><p>With a total of 16,134 infusions over 15,950 EDs, reported adverse reactions included paresthesia, headache, injection site inflammation, injection site pain, back pain, vertigo, and dry mouth. Each of these adverse reactions occurred once in the study population of 135, and thus each had a rate of 0.7%. Non-neutralizing anti-Factor VIII antibodies (without inhibitory activity as measured by the modified Bethesda assay) were reported in four patients, giving a rate of 3%. Three of four subjects had pre-existing non-neutralizing antibodies prior to exposure with Nuwiq. The binding antibodies were transient in two of these three subjects. In one subject who was tested negative at screening, the non-neutralizing antibody was measured once at study end.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immunogenicity</span></p><p>All clinical trial subjects (N = 135) were monitored for neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to Factor VIII by the modified Bethesda assay using blood samples obtained prior to the first infusion of Nuwiq, at defined intervals (at ED 10 to 15, at 3 months, and every further 3 months) during the studies and at the completion visit. No subject developed neutralizing antibodies to Factor VIII. Four subjects (3%) developed a non-neutralizing antibody without any inhibitory activity.</p><p>The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Nuwiq with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data with Nuwiq use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Nuwiq. It is not known whether Nuwiq can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Nuwiq should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defect and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of Nuwiq in human milk, the effect on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Nuwiq and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Nuwiq or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy studies were performed in 59 previously treated pediatric patients (58 patients 2 to 11 years old) who received at least one dose of Nuwiq for routine prophylaxis. Efficacy in routine prophylaxis and on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes is comparable between children and adults [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The children received a total of 5746 infusions. Of these infusions, 5316 (93%) were for prophylaxis, 216 (4%) for the treatment of bleeding episodes, 41 (0.7%) for peri-operative management and 173 (3%) for pharmacokinetic (PK) and recovery assessments. For two adverse events (mild back pain, mild headache) in two (3%) subjects, causality was rated as possibly related to Nuwiq administration.The pediatric pharmacokinetic data of Nuwiq were obtained in 29 children between 2 and 5 years of age and 30 children between 6 and ≤12 years of age. Half-life (T <span class="Sub">1/2</span> ) and incremental in vivo recovery (IVR) are lower in children than in adults and systemic drug clearance is substantially higher in the pediatric age group 2 to 5 yrs compared to adults [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Higher doses and/or a more frequent dosing schedule for prophylactic treatment should be considered in pediatric patients aged 2 to 5 yrs.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Nuwiq did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to provide conclusive evidence as to whether or not they respond differently than younger subjects.</p><h2>Nuwiq Description</h2><p class="First">Nuwiq, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, lyophilized powder for reconstitution for intravenous injection. The product is supplied in single-use vials containing nominal Factor VIII potencies of 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 2500, 3000 or 4000 IU. When reconstituted with 2.5 mL of solvent (Sterile Water for Injection), the respective nominal concentrations are 100, 200, 400, 800, 1000, 1200 or 1600 IU/mL. The reconstituted product contains the following excipients per mL: 18 mg sodium chloride, 5.4 mg sucrose, 5.4 mg L-arginine hydrochloride, 0.3 mg calcium chloride dihydrate, 1.2 mg poloxamer 188, and 1.2 mg sodium citrate dihydrate. The concentration of each of the excipients is the same for all potencies. Nuwiq contains no preservatives. Each vial of Nuwiq is labeled with the actual Factor VIII potency expressed in IU determined using one-stage clotting assay, using a reference material calibrated against a World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for Factor VIII concentrates. One IU, as defined by the WHO standard for human Factor VIII concentrates, is approximately equal to the level of Factor VIII activity in 1 mL of fresh pooled, normal, human plasma. The mean specific activity of Nuwiq is 8124 IU/mg total protein.</p><p>B-domain deleted recombinant coagulation Factor VIII (BDD-rFVIII) is the active ingredient in Nuwiq. BDD-rFVIII is a recombinant glycoprotein (a heterodimer) with an approximate molecular mass of 170 kDa, comprising the Factor VIII domains A1-A2 (so-called heavy chain of ~90 kDa) and A3-C1-C2 (so-called light chain of ~80 kDa), whereas the B-domain, present in the full-length plasma-derived Factor VIII, has been deleted. The purified protein consists of 1440 amino acids. The amino acid sequence is comparable to the B-domain deleted form of human plasma Factor VIII(90 + 80 kDa).</p><p>BDD-rFVIII is produced by recombinant DNA technology in genetically modified human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cells with no animal or human derived materials added during the manufacturing process or to the final product. As Nuwiq is produced using a human cell-line, it contains post-translational modifications comparable to human plasma-derived Factor VIII and is devoid of Neu5Gc or α-1,3-Gal epitopes[1] that may be present in products produced in animal cells. Furthermore, BDD-rFVIII is fully sulfated at Tyr1680 [1]. The active substance is concentrated and purified by a series of chromatography steps, which also includes two dedicated viral clearance steps: solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment for virus inactivation and 20 nm nanofiltration for removal of viruses.</p><h2>Nuwiq - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Nuwiq temporarily replaces the missing clotting Factor VIII that is needed for effective hemostasis.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency of functional coagulation Factor VIII, resulting in a prolonged plasma clotting time as measured by the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay. Treatment with Nuwiq normalizes the aPTT over the effective dosing period.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics (PK) of Nuwiq were evaluated in an open-label, multicenter clinical study of 22 (20 adults and 2 adolescents) previously treated patients (PTPs) with severe Hemophilia A. The PK parameters ( Table 4 ) were based on plasma Factor VIII activity measured by the one-stage clotting assay after a single intravenous infusion of a 50 IU/kg dose.</p><p>The PK profile obtained after 6 months of repeated dosing was comparable with the PK profile obtained after the first dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Nuwiq in 22 PTP Adults/Adolecents (Dose: 50 IU/kg)</span></p><p class="First">AUC (h·IU/mL)</p><p class="First">18.0 ± 5.6</p><p class="First">AUCnorm (h·IU/mL/(IU/kg))</p><p class="First">0.4 ± 0.1</p><p class="First">Cmaxnorm (IU/mL/(IU/kg))</p><p class="First">0.022 ± 0.003</p><p class="First">T1/2 (h)</p><p class="First">17.1 ± 11.2*</p><p class="First">IVR (%/IU/kg)</p><p class="First">2.1 ± 0.3</p><p class="First">MRT (h)</p><p class="First">22.5 ± 14.2</p><p class="First">CL (mL/h/kg)</p><p class="First">3.0 ± 1.0</p><p class="First">Vss (mL/kg)</p><p class="First">59.8 ± 19.8</p><p>AUC = Area under the curve (Factor VIII:C); AUCnorm = AUC divided by the dose; Cmaxnorm = Maximal plasma concentration divided by the dose; CL = Clearance; Factor VIII:C = Factor VIII coagulation activity; IVR = Incremental in vivo recovery; MRT = Mean residence time; PK = Pharmacokinetics; SD = Standard deviation; T1/2 = Terminal half-life; Vss = Volume of distribution at steady state; *Median, lower/upper quartile: 13.7, 12.0/17.5</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Pharmacokinetics</span></p><p>PK of pediatric patients is presented in Table 5 for the age groups 2 to 5 years and 6 to 12 years.

For routine prophylaxis, the efficacy of Nuwiq was evaluated in two multi-center studies, one in adult patients (n = 32) and one in pediatric patients (n = 59). For the treatment of bleeding episodes, efficacy was evaluated in one multi-center study in adolescents (n = 2) and adults (n = 20) who were treated on-demand only, and also in patients who experienced breakthrough bleeding episodes in the two prophylaxis studies. Across all studies, subjects undergoing surgical procedures were evaluated for hemostatic efficacy during perioperative management.</p><p><span class="Bold">On-demand Treatment and Control of Bleeding Episodes</span></p><p>A total of 1124 bleeding episodes in 69 subjects (35 adults, 2 adolescents, and 32 children) were treated with Nuwiq. Response to each treatment was assessed by the patients using an ordinal scale of excellent (abrupt pain relief and/or unequivocal improvement in objective signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hours after a single infusion), good (definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8–12 hours after an infusion requiring up to 2 infusions for complete resolution), moderate (probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately 12 hours after the first infusion requiring more than two infusions for complete resolution), or none (no improvement within 12 hours, or worsening of symptoms, requiring more than 2 infusions for complete resolution).</p><p>The majority of treated bleeding episodes (n = 986) was from the study where patients only received on-demand treatment. 642 (65%) bleeding episodes occurred spontaneously, 341 (35%) were traumatic, and 3 (0.3%) bleeding episodes were due to other causes. The mean dose per injection used to treat a bleeding episode was 32 IU/kg. Hemostatic efficacy in response to Nuwiq treatment was rated as excellent or good in 94% and as moderate in 6% of the bleeds.</p><p>In case of breakthrough bleeding episodes, the mean dose per injection used to treat a bleeding episode was 33.3 IU/kg in adults (n=15 with 30 bleeding episodes) and 45 IU/kg in pediatric patients (n=32 with 108 bleeding episodes). The median number of injections to treat a bleeding episode was 1. Hemostatic efficacy was excellent or good in 100% of bleeds in adults and 82% of bleeds in pediatric patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Perioperative Management of Bleeding</span></p><p>Across all studies, the efficacy of Nuwiq as surgical prophylaxis was assessed in a total of 33 surgical procedures in 19 patients; 20 procedures in 7 patients were classed as minor and 13 procedures in 12 patients were classed as major. Nuwiq pre-operative dosing ranged from 35 IU/kg to 50 IU/kg per infusion. The total number of infusions administered ranged from 1 to 5 for minor and 4 to 35 for major surgeries; one surgery required an injection of Nuwiq during surgery.</p><p>The efficacy of surgical prophylaxis was rated for each case by a surgeon and a hematologist, taking into account both the intra- and postoperative assessment. Hemostasis efficacy was rated at the end of the surgery by the surgeon and postoperatively by the surgeon and hematologist using ordinal scales as follows:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Excellent: Intra-operative: intra-operative blood loss lower than or equal to the average expected blood loss for the type of procedure performed in a patient with normal hemostasis;. Postoperative: No postoperative bleeding or oozing that was not due to complications of surgery.

<li>Good: Intra-operative: intra-operative blood loss was higher than average expected blood loss but lower than or equal to the maximal expected blood loss for the type of procedure in a patient with normal hemostasis; Postoperative: No postoperative bleeding or oozing that was not due to complications of surgery. Control of postoperative bleeding due to complications of surgery required increased dosing with Nuwiq or additional infusions, not originally anticipated for the type of procedure.</li>
<li>Moderate: Intra-operative: Intra-operative blood loss was higher than maximal expected blood loss for the type of procedure performed in a patient with normal hemostasis, but hemostasis was controlled. Postoperative: Some postoperative bleeding and oozing that was not due to complications of surgery; control of postoperative bleeding required increased dosing with Nuwiq or additional infusions, not originally anticipated for the type of procedure.</li>
<li>None: Intra-operative: Hemostasis was uncontrolled necessitating a change in clotting factor replacement regimen. Postoperative: Extensive uncontrolled postoperative bleeding and oozing. Control of postoperative bleeding required use of an alternate FVIII concentrate.</li>
