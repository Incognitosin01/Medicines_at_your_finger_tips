It has creeping rhizomes and lance-shaped, glossy leaves that form whorls around the stems. It is native to Eurasia and North Africa and grows throughout North America. The plant is also known as Asperula odorata L.</p><p>The small, star-shaped, white flowers appear from April to June. The dried whole plant is used in traditional medicine. When cut, the plant develops a characteristic smell of fresh-cut hay.Chevallier 1996, Duke 2003, Khan 2009, USDA 2006</p><h2>History</h2><p>Sweet woodruff has been used as a sedative, antispasmodic, diuretic, and sweat inducer.Chevallier 1996, Duke 2003, Khan 2009 It is a flavoring component in May wines (woodruff soaked in sweet white wine), vermouth, and some bitters and is used in food, candy flavorings, gelatins, and puddings. Sweet woodruff has been used to cure boils and heal inflammations.Chevallier 1996, Khan 2009 In homeopathy, the plant is used as an antispasmodic and to treat liver impairment. The bruised leaves have been applied topically to reduce swelling and improve wound healing.Duke 2003 Extracts and teas have been administered as expectorants. Woodruff is usually administered as a tea. The dried herb is used in sachets, and the extract is used in perfumes and other fragrances.Duke 2003</p><p>In traditional medicine it has been used to cure restlessness, insomnia, stomachache, migraine, neuralgia, and bladder stones. In European cultures, sweet woodruff is used for prophylaxis and therapy of respiratory conditions, and for gallbladder, kidney, and circulatory disorders. It also has been applied topically for venous conditions such as varicose veins and hemorrhoids.Duke 2003, Khan 2009</p><p>The coumarin and flavonoid components are responsible for its use in treating varicose veins and phlebitis.Chevallier 1996 The plant is also purported to have antibacterial activity.Duke 2003</p><p>Modern herbalists have used the herb as a laxative and an antiarthritic.Dobelis 1986</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Sweet woodruff contains coumarin (0.6%)Chevallier 1996 in a glycosidic form that is freed by enzymatic action during the drying process. However, at least one study did not detect any coumarins in sweet woodruff.</p><p>Medium pressure liquid chromatography revealed 225 substances within the plant. One of these substances, previously not found in nature, may be used as an indicator of illegal use of sweet woodruff in food aromas: 7,11,15-trimethyl-2-hexadecanone.Woerner 1991</p><p>The plant contains a number of minor components including asperuloside (0.05%), monotropein, tannins, iridoids, anthraquinones, flavonoids, traces of nicotinic acid, a fixed oil, and a bitter principle. The root contains a red dye of the alizarin type.Chevallier 1996, Duke 2003, Khan 2009, Sticher 1971</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>Asperuloside and components in the leaves of the plant are reported to have antiphlogistic or anti-inflammatory activity.Duke 2003, Khan 2009</p><h3>Animal Data</h3><p>When evaluated in vivo in rats, an extract of G. odoratum administered orally inhibited carrageenan-induced, rat-paw edema by 25%; this compared favorably with the 45% inhibition observed following indomethacin administration.Mascolo 1987</p><p>An experiment in rats demonstrated antioxidant and wound healing properties of G. odoratum extracts when applied topically.Kahkeshani 2013</p><h3>Clinical Data</h3><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of woodruff for any condition.</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Studies suggest the safety limit for preparation of spiced wine is less than 5 ppm of coumarin, which is approximately 3 to 3.5 g of fresh woodruff per liter of beverage.Laub 1982, Laub 1985</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>There is some concern over the toxic potential of the plant's coumarin content;Dobelis 1986 therefore, avoid use during pregnancy and lactation.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>Although coumarin content is low, monitor for any potentially clinical significant interactions in patients being treated for cardiovascular conditions with conventional medications.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The plant is generally recognized as safe for use in foods as a flavoring.</p><p>Adverse events are unlikely at normal dietary intake of the plant or its extracts. Excessive doses may lead to internal bleeding, and hepatotoxicity may occur with long term exposure.Duke 2003, Khan 2009</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Some concern has been raised over the toxic potential of the coumarin content of the plant; reports of clotting anomalies, growth inhibition, hepatotoxicity and testicular atrophy in animals exist.Duke 2003 Average coumarin content found in dry weight of the plant is 1.06%.Laub 1985</p><h2>Index Terms</h2><ul><li><i>Asperula odorata</i> L.</li></ul><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
