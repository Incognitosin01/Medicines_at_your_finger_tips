Benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial agent with demonstrated activity against <span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes.</span> This action, combined with the mild keratolytic effect of benzoyl peroxide is believed to be responsible for its usefulness in acne.</p><p>Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is metabolized to benzoic acid and excreted as benzoate in the urine.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Perrigo Benzoyl Peroxide Gel</h2><p class="First">Benzoyl Peroxide Gel 2.5%, 5%, and 10% are indicated for use in the topical treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Benzoyl Peroxide Gel 2.5%, 5%, and 10% may be used as an adjunct in acne treatment regimens including antibiotics, retinoic acid products, and sulfur/salicylic acid containing preparations.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Benzoyl Peroxide Gel 2.5%, 5%, and 10% should not be used in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to benzoyl peroxide or to any of the other ingredients in the products.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General -</h3><p class="First">For external use only. Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. <span class="Bold">AVOID CONTACT WITH HAIR, FABRICS OR CARPETING AS BENZOYL PEROXIDE WILL CAUSE BLEACHING.</span></p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility -</h3><p class="First">Based upon all available evidence, benzoyl peroxide is not considered to be a carcinogen. However, data from a study using mice known to be highly susceptible to cancer suggest that benzoyl peroxide acts as a tumor promoter. The clinical significance of the findings is not known.</p><h3>Pregnancy:</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with benzoyl peroxide. It is also not known whether benzoyl peroxide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Benzoyl peroxide should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers -</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when benzoyl peroxide is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use -</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Contact sensitization reactions are associated with the use of topical benzoyl peroxide products and may be expected to occur in 10 to 25 of 1000 patients. The most frequent adverse reactions associated with benzoyl peroxide use are excessive erythema and peeling which may be expected to occur in 5 of 100 patients. Excessive erythema and peeling most frequently appear during the initial phase of drug use and may normally be controlled by reducing frequency of use.</p><h2>Perrigo Benzoyl Peroxide Gel Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">It is recommended that therapy be initiated with Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 2.5%, applying the medication to the affected areas once a day during the first week, and twice a day thereafter as tolerated. Frequency of use should be adjusted to obtain the desired clinical response. Therapy with Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 5% or Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 10% may be initiated in patients who demonstrate accommodation to Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 2.5%.</p><p>Gentle cleansing of the affected areas prior to application of Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 2.5%, 5%, or 10% may be beneficial.</p><p>Clinically visible improvements will normally occur by the third week of therapy. Maximum lesion reduction may be expected after approximately eight to twelve weeks of drug use. Continuing use of the drug is normally required to maintain a satisfactory clinical response.</p><h2>How is Perrigo Benzoyl Peroxide Gel Supplied</h2><p class="First">Benzoyl Peroxide Gel 2.5%, 5%, and 10% are available as follows:</p><p><span class="Bold">Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 2.5%</span><span class="Bold">Aqueous Base Acne Gel</span></p><p>60 g tube (NDC 45802-<span class="Bold">905</span>-96)</p><p><span class="Bold">Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 5%</span><span class="Bold">Aqueous Base Acne Gel</span></p><p>60 g tube (NDC 45802-<span class="Bold">910</span>-96)</p><p>90 g tube (NDC 45802-<span class="Bold">910</span>-01)</p><p><span class="Bold">Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 10%</span><span class="Bold">Aqueous Base Acne Gel</span></p><p>60 g tube (NDC 45802-<span class="Bold">915</span>-96)</p><p>90 g tube (NDC 45802-<span class="Bold">915</span>-01)</p><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Store at 20-25°C (68-77°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p><p class="First">Manufactured by Stiefel Laboratories, Inc.</p><p>Research Triangle Park, NC 27709</p><p>Distributed By</p><p>Perrigo®</p><p>Allegan, MI 49010 • www.perrigo.com</p><p>Rev. 12/10</p><p>305253</p><p>: 0H400 RC J2</p><h2>Principal Display Panel - Carton</h2><p class="First">Rx Only</p><p>Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 2.5%</p><p>For Topical Use Only</p><p>Aqueous Base Acne Gel</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 2.5% Carton</p><h2>Principal Display Panel - Tube</h2><p class="First">Rx Only</p><p>Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 2.5%</p><p>For Topical Use Only</p><p>Aqueous Base Acne Gel</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 2.5% Tube</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2><ul>
