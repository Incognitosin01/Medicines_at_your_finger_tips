</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vitetal Elixir Prescribing Info</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Rx Only</span></p><h2>Description</h2><p class="First">Each Vitetal 5 mL (teaspoonful) of elixir contains:</p><h3>INACTIVE INGREDIENTS</h3><p class="First">Ethyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Purified Water, Saccharin Sodium, Sorbitol Solution, Natural and Artificial Orange Flavor, FD &amp; C Red #40.</p><h2>Vitetal Elixir - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">This drug combination provides natural belladonna alkaloids in a specific, fixed ratio combined with phenobarbital to provide peripheral anticholinergic/antispasmodic action and mild sedation.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Glaucoma, obstructive uropathy (for example, bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy); obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract (as in achalasia, pyloroduodenal stenosis, etc.); paralytic ileus, intestinal atony of the elderly or debilitated patient; unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage; severe ulcerative colitis especially if complicated by toxic megacolon; myasthenia gravis; hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis.</p><p>Vitetal Elixir is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. Phenobarbital is contraindicated in acute intermittent porphyria and in those patients in whom phenobarbital produces restlessness and/or excitement.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">In the presence of a high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with belladonna alkaloids (fever and heatstroke due to decreased sweating).</p><p>Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful.</p><p>Vitetal Elixir may produce drowsiness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned, should these occur, not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery, and not to perform hazardous work.</p><p>Phenobarbital may decrease the effect of anticoagulants, and necessitate larger doses of the anticoagulant for optimal effect. When the phenobarbital is discontinued, the dose of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased.</p><p>Phenobarbital may be habit forming and should not be administered to individuals known to be addiction prone or to those with a history of physical and/or psychological dependence upon drugs.</p><p>Since barbiturates are metabolized in the liver, they should be used with caution and initial doses should be small in patients with hepatic dysfunction.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>GENERAL</h3><p class="First">Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hepatic or renal disease, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia, and hypertension.</p><p>Belladonna alkaloids may produce a delay in gastric emptying (antral stasis) which would complicate the management of gastric ulcer.</p><p>Do not rely on the use of the drug in the presence of complication of biliary tract disease. Theoretically, with overdosage, a curare-like action may occur.</p><h3>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p><h3>PREGNANCY</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Vitetal Elixir. It is not known whether Vitetal Elixir can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Vitetal Elixir should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>NURSING MOTHERS</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Vitetal Elixir is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions may include xerostomia; urinary hesitancy and retention; blurred vision; tachycardia; palpitation; mydriasis; cycloplegia; increased ocular tension; loss of taste sense; headache; nervousness; drowsiness; weakness; dizziness; insomnia; nausea; vomiting; impotence; suppression of lactation; constipation; bloated feeling; musculoskeletal pain; severe allergic reaction or drug idiosyncrasies, including anaphylaxis, urticaria and other dermal manifestations; and decreased sweating. Elderly patients may react with symptoms of excitement, agitation, drowsiness, and other untoward manifestations to even small doses of the drug. Phenobarbital may produce excitement in some patients, rather than a sedative effect. In patients habituated to barbiturates, abrupt withdrawal may produce delirium or convulsions.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The signs and symptoms of overdose are headache, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, dilated pupils, hot and dry skin, dizziness, dryness of the mouth, difficulty in swallowing, and CNS stimulation. Treatment should consist of gastric lavage, emetics, and activated charcoal. If indicated, parenteral cholinergic agents such as physostigmine or bethanechol chloride, should be used.</p><h2>Vitetal Elixir Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The dosage of Vitetal Elixir should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient to assure symptomatic control with a minimum of adverse effects.</p><h3>Vitetal Elixir. Adults</h3><p class="First">One or two teaspoonfuls of elixir three or four times a day according to conditions and severity of symptoms.</p><h3>Pediatric patients</h3><p class="First">may be dosed every 4 to 6 hours.</p><h2>How is Vitetal Elixir Supplied</h2><p class="First">Vitetal Elixir red colored, orange flavored liquid.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">AVOID FREEZING</span></p><p>Store Vitetal Elixir at 20째-25째C (68째-77째F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p><p>Protect from light and moisture.</p><p>Dispense in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP using a child-resistant closure.
