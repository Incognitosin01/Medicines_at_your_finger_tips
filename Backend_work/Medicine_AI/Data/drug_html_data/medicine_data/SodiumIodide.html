Management: Discontinue sodium iodide supplementation at least 10 days before sodium iodide I-131 administration, and avoid concurrent use.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Frequency not defined.</p><p>Hematologic &amp; oncologic: Eosinophilia, hemorrhage, lymph node hyperplasia</p><p>Hypersensitivity: Anaphylactic shock, angioedema, hypersensitivity</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Arthralgia</p><p>Miscellaneous: Fever</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic shock (sometimes fatal), have been reported; evaluate patients for iodide sensitivity prior to administration and discontinue immediately if a reaction occurs.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns: </i></b></p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution; iodine supplements in total parenteral nutrition solutions may need to be adjusted, reduced, or omitted.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b> </p><p>• Aluminum: The parenteral product may contain aluminum; toxic aluminum concentrations may be seen with high doses, prolonged use, or renal dysfunction. Premature neonates are at higher risk due to immature renal function and aluminum intake from other parenteral sources. Parenteral aluminum exposure of  &gt;4 to 5 mcg/kg/day is associated with CNS and bone toxicity; tissue loading may occur at lower doses (Federal Register 2002). See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b> </p><p>• Appropriate use: Sodium iodide is a hypotonic solution; administer in admixtures only. </p><p>• Other sources of iodine: Iodine is readily absorbed through skin, lungs, and mucous membranes; consider environmental and topical (eg, topical skin disinfectants, surgical swabs, solutions) sources of iodine and their contribution to iodine stores.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Periodically monitor thyroid function</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Sodium iodide for injection may be used in pregnant women as an iodine supplement when needed in total parenteral nutrition (TPN). An adequate amount of iodine intake is essential for thyroid function. Iodine crosses the placenta and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Iodine deficiency in pregnancy can lead to neurologic damage in the newborn; an extreme form, cretinism, is characterized by gross mental retardation, short stature, deaf mutism, and spasticity. Large amounts of iodine during pregnancy can cause fetal goiter or hyperthyroidism (IOM 2001). </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to give electrolytes to the body when more are needed.
