</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Belladonna and Opium Suppository</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> are indicated for the management of ureteral spasm pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> are used for relief of moderate to severe pain associated with ureteral spasm not responsive to non-narcotic analgesics and to space intervals between injections of opiates.  <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> are for rectal use only.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span></p><p>Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>], reserve <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]:</p><ul>
<li>Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated</li>
<li>Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesic</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Not recommended for use in children 12 years of age and under</span></p><h2>Belladonna and Opium Suppository Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5)</span>].</p><p>Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><p>Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> and adjust the dosage accordingly [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adult:</span> One <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppository</span> administered rectally once or twice daily, not to exceed four doses daily or as recommended by the physician. Moisten finger and suppository with water before inserting. Absorption is dependent on body hydration and not on body temperature.</p><p><span class="Bold">Not recommended for use in children 12 years of age and under.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from Other Opioids to Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span></p><p>There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>. It is safer to underestimate a patient’s 24-hour <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from Belladonna and Opium suppositories to Extended-Release Opioid</span></p><p>The relative bioavailability of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> compared to extended-release opioid is unknown, so conversion to extended-release drug product must be accompanied by close observation for signs of excessive sedation and respiratory depression.</p><h3>Maintenance of Therapy</h3><p class="First">Continually reevaluate patients receiving <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.</p><p>If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the <span class="Italics">B</span><span class="Italics">elladonna and</span> <span class="Italics">Opium Suppositories</span> dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.</p><h3>Discontinuation of Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</h3><p class="First">When a patient who has been taking <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>, use a gradual downward titration of the dosage to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal. Do not stop <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> abruptly [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.12), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)</span>].</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> are available in two strengths:</p><ul>
<li>Belladonna 16.2 mg and opium 30 mg</li>
<li>Belladonna 16.2 mg and opium 60 mg</li>

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span></span> <span class="Bold">are not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age.</span></p><h3>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> contain opium, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [<span class="Italics">see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)</span>].</p><p class="Default"><span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> are for rectal use only and must be inserted whole. Cutting, breaking, crushing, chewing, or dissolving <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> can lead to dangerous adverse events including death.  Further, instruct patients of the hazards related to taking opioids including fatal overdose.</p><p>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.</p><p>Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>, and monitor all patients receiving <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [<span class="Italics">see Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [<span class="Italics">see Overdosage (10)</span>]. Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>.</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> is essential [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span>]. Overestimating the <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.</p><p>Accidental exposure of even one dose of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of opium.</p><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS)</h3><p class="First">Prolonged use of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information</span>].</p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol, Benzodiazepines or Other Central Nervous System Depressants</h3><p class="First">Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7) and Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>].</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</h3><p class="First">The use of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease</span>: <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium </span><span class="Italics">Suppositories</span> [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</span>: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</p><p>Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> and when <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.</p><h3>Interactions with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may potentiate the effects of opioids, including respiratory depression, coma, and confusion. <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.</p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any opioid as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><h3>Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>. In patients with circulatory shock, <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> in patients with circulatory shock.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness</h3><p class="First">In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium </span><span class="Italics">Suppositories</span>.</p><p>Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>The opium in <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</h3><p class="First">The opium in <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> therapy.</p><h3>Withdrawal</h3><p class="First">Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>When discontinuing <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>, gradually taper the dosage [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span>].</p><p>Do not abruptly discontinue <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> [<span class="Italics">see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)</span>].</p><h3>Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositorie</span><span class="Italics">s</span> and know how they will react to the medication <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Adverse Events</h3><p class="First">Belladonna may cause drowsiness, dry mouth, urinary retention, photophobia, rapid pulse, dizziness and blurred vision7. Opium usage may result in constipation, nausea or vomiting. Pruritis and urticaria may occasionally occur. Hypersensitivity to opium or belladonna may occur.</p><p>The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:</p><ul>

There are no available data with <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage.</p><p>Animal studies have not been conducted with <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories.</span></p><p>The active principles of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>, atropine and morphine, are known to enter the fetal circulation. Regular use of opium alkaloids during pregnancy has resulted in addiction of the fetus leading to withdrawal symptoms in the neonate. <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium </span><span class="Italics">Suppositories</span> therefore should be used by a pregnant woman with caution and only when clearly indicated by a physician.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth.</p><p>Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>].</p><p>Belladonna refers to plant alkaloids that contain anticholinergic agents such as atropine. Atropine used in human pregnancies has not been associated with birth defects or adverse fetal effects although the drug readily crosses the placenta. Use during pregnancy may increase risk of respiratory abnormalities, hypospadias, and eye or ear malformations but causal relationship is unclear. The Collaborative Perinatal Project found no relationship between first trimester use of atropine and birth defects in the offspring but found an increase in birth defects in general in the offspring of pregnancies where the mother had taken belladonna. There was no relationship to any particular syndrome of anomalies. A statistically significant (although weak) association was discovered between congenital anomalies and maternal use of belladonna. A study was conducted based on the infants of 554 women who took belladonna during the first four months of pregnancy. The study was conducted in the Collaborative Perinatal Project and showed that belladonna is unlikely to cause minor congenital abnormalities. The estimated maximum risk is most likely less than 3% if maternal belladonna is used early in pregnancy.</p><p><span class="Italics">Labor or Delivery</span></p><p>Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium </span><span class="Italics">Suppositories</span> and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> or from the underlying maternal condition. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.

Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Infertility</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> in pediatric patients have not been established.  <span class="Bold">These preparations are not recommended for use in children 12 years of age and under.</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to belladonna and opium. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> slowly in geriatric patients [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> contain opium, a Schedule II substance controlled by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> contain opium, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p><p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</p><p>“Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers) to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Health care providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p><span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p><span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> are for rectal use only and must be inserted whole. Cutting, breaking, crushing, chewing or dissolving <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> can lead to dangerous adverse events including death. Any abuse of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> with alcohol, benzodiazepines and other central nervous system depressants.</p><p>Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p><p>Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</p><p><span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> should not be abruptly discontinued [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span>]. If <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium </span><span class="Italics">Suppositories</span> are abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur. Some or all the following can characterize this syndrome: restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including: irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span></p><p>Acute overdose with <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, hot or dry or flushed skin, dry mouth, hyperpyrexia, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment of Overdose</span></p><p>In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opium overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opium overdose.</p><p>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of opium in <span class="Italics">B</span><span class="Italics">elladonna and Opium Suppositories</span>, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established.

The belladonna extract component of the rectal suppository provides the active alkaloids atropine and scopolamine, while the opium component provides primarily morphine (among more than 20 alkaloids). The atropine alkaloid is parasympatholytic, exerting antispasmodic activity by relaxation of smooth muscle that is stimulated by the parasympathetic nervous system. The atropine alkaloid is also the dl isomer of l-hyoscyamine and exerts the same pharmacologic activity; however, it exerts about one-half the activity peripherally as l-hyoscyamine. Atropine activity also counteracts morphine induced smooth muscle spasm without affecting the analgesia. The morphine alkaloid of opium exerts analgesic activity by increasing the pain threshold and decreasing the sensitivity to pain. The oxidative dealkylated nor-metabolites of morphine begin the analgesic process. Additionally, the side effect of euphoria may contribute to sense of pain relief.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Through its parasympatholytic action, atropine (belladonna) relaxes smooth muscle resulting from parasympathetic stimulation. It is the dl isomer of l-hyoscyamine and therefore exhibits the same clinical effects. It is, however, approximately one-half as active peripherally as l-hyoscyamine, the latter being the major active plant alkaloid. The dl isomer atropine is formed during the process of isolation of the belladonna extract.</p><p>Morphine, the major active principle of powdered opium, is responsible for the action of powdered opium although the other alkaloids present also contribute to it. The sedative and analgesic action of morphine, the effect desired by inclusion in <span class="Italics">Belladonna and Opium Suppositories</span> of powdered opium, are thought to be due to the depressant effect on the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus and medullary centers. In large doses, the opiates and their analogs also exhibit synaptic conduction in the spinothalamic tracts, depress the function of the reticular formation, the lemniscus and the thalamic relays, and inhibit spinal synaptic reflexes: but these inhibitor actions should not be elicited with therapeutic doses of the drug. Moderate doses of powdered opium should not alter the electroencephalogram.</p><p>The action of morphine consists mainly of a descending depression of the central nervous system. It exerts its analgesic action by increasing the pain threshold or the magnitude of stimulus required to evoke pain and by dulling the sensibility or reaction to pain. In addition to its action in abolishing pain, morphine induces a sense of well-being (euphoria) facilitating certain mental processes while retarding others.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Upon absorption of morphine, oxidative dealkylation to produce nor-compounds appears to be the first step in the reaction sequence which imparts analgesia. Morphine is conjugated in the liver to form the 3-glucuronide which passes into the bile and is reabsorbed and excreted in the urine. The atropine effect of the belladonna extract serves to eliminate morphine induced smooth muscle spasm without affecting the sedative analgesic action of powdered opium.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Belladonna (16.2 mg) and Opium (30 mg) Suppositories are brown, bullet shaped suppositories.<br/>
