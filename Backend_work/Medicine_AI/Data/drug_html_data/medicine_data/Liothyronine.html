Liothyronine is given when the thyroid does not produce enough of this hormone on its own.</p><p>Liothyronine treats hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone). Liothyronine is also given as part of a medical test for thyroid disorders.</p><p>Liothyronine is also used together with surgery and radioactive iodine therapy in people with thyroid cancer.</p><p>Liothyronine should not be used to treat obesity or weight problems.</p><p>Liothyronine may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Liothyronine should not be used to treat obesity or weight problems.</b></p><p>You may not be able to use  liothyronine if you have an adrenal gland problem that is not controlled by treatment.</p><p>Stop taking liothyronine and call your doctor if you have <b>symptoms of thyroid toxicity</b>, such as chest pain, fast or pounding heartbeats, feeling hot or nervous, or sweating more than usual.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Since thyroid hormone occurs naturally in the body, almost anyone can take liothyronine.
