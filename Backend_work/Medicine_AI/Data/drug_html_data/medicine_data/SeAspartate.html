Selenium is needed for certain enzymes that help with normal body functions.</p><p>Although selenium is being used to prevent certain types of cancer, there is not enough information to show that this is effective.</p><h2>Importance of Diet</h2><p>For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods.

<li>Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs)</li>
</ul><p>For Canada—</p><ul>
