The cancer cells work to reprogram their environment and develop strategies that enable them to transform and survive.</p><p>If treatment with Xtandi stops working then other treatments may be offered, such as:</p><ul>
<li>Chemotherapy</li>
<li>Immunotherapy</li>
<li>Targeted therapy</li>
<li>Radiotherapy</li>
</ul><p>Stopping treatment with Xtandi may also result in an antiandrogen withdrawal response (AAWR), which can cause the cancer to stop growing or shrink for the period of time. Continue reading</p><p>Xtandi is typically taken until prostate cancer starts to progress or spread (metastasize), or until the patient can no longer tolerate therapy because of the side effects or adverse events it causes.</p><p>In clinical trials, Xtandi was effective at delaying the time to disease progression in men with advanced prostate cancer. In men who had not received prior treatment with chemotherapy, Xtandi was also effective at delaying the need for treatment with a cytotoxic chemotherapy agent.</p><p>In the AFFIRM trial, treatment with Xtandi extended life by almost 5 months in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Continue reading</p><p>Xtandi is an androgen receptor inhibitor or anti-androgen. Androgens are a group of hormones, which includes testosterone, that stimulate prostate cancer cells to grow.</p><p>Xtandi works by blocking the action of androgens at the androgen receptor - reducing how often androgens can connect with the receptor - which helps prevent prostate cancer cells from growing and spreading. Continue reading</p><p>A decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is seen in some men with advanced prostate cancer who are treated with Xtandi (enzalutamide).</p><p>Levels of PSA in the blood can become elevated when there is a problem with the prostate, such as when prostate cancer develops. Monitoring PSA levels in the blood is one of the methods used to determine how prostate cancer is responding to treatment with Xtandi.
