Ask your doctor if you are not sure you are opioid-tolerant.</p><p>Oxecta may be habit forming. <b>Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away Oxecta to any other person is against the law.</p><p>Some medicines can interact with oxycodone and cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Be sure your doctor knows if you also take medicine for depression, mental illness, Parkinson's disease, migraine headaches, serious infections, or prevention of nausea and vomiting. Ask your doctor before making any changes in how or when you take your medications.</p><p>To make sure Oxecta is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>any type of breathing problem or lung disease;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a history of head injury, brain tumor, or seizures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a history of drug abuse, alcohol addiction, or mental illness;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>urination problems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>liver or kidney disease;</p>

If you use Oxecta while you are pregnant, your baby could become dependent on oxycodone. This can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the baby after it is born. Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks.</p><p>Oxycodone can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. You should not breast-feed while you are using Oxecta.</p><p>Do not give this medicine to a child without medical advice.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use Oxecta?</h2><p>Take Oxecta exactly as prescribed. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Oxecta can slow or stop your breathing, especially when you start using this medicine or whenever your dose is changed. Never take in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain.</p><p>Take each tablet with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing the tablet in the mouth. Oxecta tablets must be swallowed whole. Do not crush or dissolve.</p><p>Do not pre-soak, lick or otherwise wet the Oxecta tablet prior to placing in the mouth.</p><p>Oxycodone may be habit-forming, even at regular doses. Take this medicine exactly as prescribed by your doctor. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH.</p><p>Do not stop using oxycodone suddenly after long-term use, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to avoid withdrawal symptoms when you stop using this medicine.</p><p>Never crush or break an Oxecta tablet to inhale the powder or mix it into a liquid to inject the drug into your vein. This practice has resulted in death with the misuse of oxycodone and similar prescription drugs.</p><p>Store Oxecta at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and light.</p><p>Keep track of the amount of medicine used from each new bottle. Oxycodone is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Always check your bottle to make sure you have received the correct pills (same brand and type) of medicine prescribed by your doctor. Ask the pharmacist if you have any questions about the medicine you receive at the pharmacy.</p><p>Do not keep leftover Oxecta tablets. Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, flush any unused tablets down the toilet. Disposal of medicines by flushing is recommended to reduce the danger of accidental overdose causing death. This advice applies to a very small number of medicines only. The FDA, working with the manufacturer, has determined this method to be the most appropriate route of disposal and presents the least risk to human safety.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Oxecta is used when needed, you may not be on a dosing schedule. If you are on a schedule and you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. Do not take 2 doses at once unless instructed by your healthcare provider. If you are not sure call your healthcare provider.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>An oxycodone overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b></p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid?</h2><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death can occur when alcohol is combined with Oxecta. Check your food and medicine labels to be sure these products do not contain alcohol.</p><p>Oxecta may impair your thinking or reactions.
