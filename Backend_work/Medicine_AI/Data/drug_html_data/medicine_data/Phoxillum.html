</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Phoxillum</h2><p class="First">PRISMASOL and Phoxillum solutions are indicated in pediatric and adult patients for use as a replacement solution in Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) to replace plasma volume removed by ultrafiltration and to correct electrolyte and acid-base imbalances.They may also be used in case of drug poisoning when CRRT is used to remove dialyzable substances.</p><h2>Phoxillum Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Visually inspect PRISMASOL and Phoxillum for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.</span></p><p>Administration should only be under the direction of a physician competent in intensive care treatment including CRRT. Use only with extracorporeal dialysis equipment appropriate for CRRT.</p><p>The prepared solution is for single patient use only.</p><p>Aseptic technique should be used throughout administration to the patient.</p><p>Discard any unused solution.</p><h3>Dosing Considerations</h3><p class="First">PRISMASOL replacement solutions contain 4 different combinations of active ingredients (8 different products with varying ingredient amounts). Phoxillum replacement solutions contain 2 different combinations of active ingredients (2 different products with varying ingredient amounts). PRISMASOL and Phoxillum are supplied in a two-compartment bag that must be mixed immediately prior to use <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Small compartment A (250 mL) containing an electrolyte solution, and</li>
<li>Large compartment B (4750 mL) containing the buffer solution.</li>
</ul><p>See Table 1 for the concentrations of the active ingredients (after mixing) in these 10 different replacement solutions (total volume is 5 Liters).</p><p>Select the mode of therapy, solute formulation, flow rates, and length of PRISMASOL and PHOXILLIUM replacement therapy in CRRT based on the patient's clinical condition, and fluid, electrolyte, acid-base, glucose balance. Administer either PRISMASOL or Phoxillum into the extracorporeal circuit:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Before (pre-dilution) the hemofilter or hemodiafilter,</li>
<li>After (post-dilution) the hemofilter or hemodiafilter, or</li>
<li>Before and after the hemofilter or hemodiafilter.</li>
</ul><h3>Preparing the Solution</h3><p class="First">Use only if the overwrap is not damaged, all seals are intact, and the solution is clear. Press bag firmly to test for any leakage. Do not use if container is damaged or leaking.</p><p>The solution may be heated to no more than 40°C/104°F inside of the overwrap. After heating, verify that the solution remains clear and contains no particulate matter.</p><p>Follow the instructions below when connecting the solution bags for correct use of the access ports</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1</span></p><h3>Adding Drugs to the Solutions</h3><p class="First">After mixing, additional drugs may be added to the bag via injection connector (spike connector) in large compartment B. In general, drugs other than phosphate should be administered through a different access line. When introducing additives, use aseptic techniques.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRISMASOL Solutions:</span></p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Phosphate:</span> Phosphate up to 1.2 mmol/L may be added to the solution. If potassium phosphate is added, the total potassium concentration should not exceed 4 mEq/L.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Phoxillum Solutions:</span></p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Phosphate:</span> Phosphate up to 0.2 mmol/L may be added to the solution. Use sodium phosphate if adding phosphate to bag. The total phosphate concentration should not exceed 1.2 mmol/L.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">See Table 1 for the concentrations of the active ingredients (after mixing) in these 10 different replacement solutions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]<span class="Bold">.</span></span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Electrolyte and Volume Abnormalities</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Monitor hemodynamic status and fluid, electrolyte and acid-base balance throughout the procedure. During hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration using PRISMASOL or Phoxillum replacement solutions, abnormalities in the plasma concentration of potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate may develop. These abnormalities may be corrected by changing the formulations of replacement solution or by supplementation <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)].</span></span></p><h3>Hyperglycemia with Dextrose Containing Solutions</h3><p class="First">The use of PRISMASOL replacement solutions containing dextrose may increase the risk for hyperglycemia in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. Patients may require initiation of or modification of antidiabetic therapy during treatment with PRISMASOL solutions containing dextrose. Monitor blood glucose.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">As with the use of other replacement solutions, blood concentrations of dialyzable drugs may be influenced by CRRT. The blood concentrations of certain drugs may need to be monitored and appropriate therapy implemented to correct for removal during treatment.</p><h3>Citrate</h3><p class="First">When used as an anticoagulant, citrate contributes to the overall buffer load and can reduce plasma calcium levels. Select the PRISMASOL/Phoxillum formulation(s) accordingly.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATION</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C</p><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PRISMASOL and Phoxillum solutions. While there are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women, appropriate administration of PRISMASOL and Phoxillum solutions with monitoring of fluid, electrolyte, acid-base and glucose balance, is not expected to cause fetal harm, or affect reproductive capacity. Maintenance of normal acid-base balance is important for fetal well-being.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">The components of PRISMASOL and Phoxillum solutions are excreted in human milk. Appropriate administration of PRISMASOL and Phoxillum solutions with monitoring of fluid, electrolyte, acid-base and glucose balance, is not expected to harm a nursing infant.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness have been established based on published clinical data of CRRT replacement solutions with compositions similar to PRISMASOL and Phoxillum used in adults and two hemofiltration studies in pediatric patients, including a study of newborns to 17 years old.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The experience with PRISMASOL and Phoxillum solutions in geriatric patients has not identified novel concerns.</p><h2>Phoxillum Description</h2><p class="First">PRISMASOL and Phoxillum solutions are clear, sterile, free of bacterial endotoxins and contain no bacteriostatic or antimicrobial agents. These solutions are used in Continuous Renal Replacement Therapies (CRRT) as a replacement solution in hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration. Depending on the product (see Table 2), the two compartments contain:</p><p>Calcium chloride, USP, is chemically designated calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl<span class="Sub">2</span> ∙ 2H<span class="Sub">2</span>O).</p><p>Magnesium chloride, USP, is chemically designated magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl<span class="Sub">2</span> ∙ 6H<span class="Sub">2</span>O).</p><p>Sodium chloride, USP, is chemically designated NaCl.</p><p>Potassium chloride, USP, is chemically designated KCl.</p><p>Sodium bicarbonate, USP, is chemically designated NaHCO<span class="Sub">3</span>.</p><p>Dextrose, USP, is chemically designated D-Glucose anhydrous (C<span class="Sub">6</span>H<span class="Sub">12</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span>) or D-Glucose monohydrate (C<span class="Sub">6</span>H<span class="Sub">12</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span> ∙ H<span class="Sub">2</span>O).</p><p>Lactic acid, USP, is chemically designated CH<span class="Sub">3</span>CH(OH)COOH.</p><p>Dibasic sodium phosphate, USP, is chemically designated as disodium hydrogen phosphate, dihydrate (Na<span class="Sub">2</span>HPO<span class="Sub">4</span> ∙ 2H<span class="Sub">2</span>O)</p><p>The pH of the final solution is in the range of 7.0 to 8.5.</p><h2>Phoxillum - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">PRISMASOL and Phoxillum solutions are pharmacologically inactive. The electrolyte concentrations in the solutions are chosen to restore plasma levels to clinically desired concentrations or maintain plasma levels at the desired concentrations.</p><p>PRISMASOL and Phoxillum solutions are used as replacement solution to replace water and electrolytes removed during hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration. Bicarbonate (or precursor lactate) in the solution is used as an alkalinizing buffer to restore acid-base balance to a clinically desirable level.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The distribution of electrolytes, bicarbonate, and dextrose is determined by the patient's clinical condition, metabolic status, and residual renal function.</p><p>The elimination and replacement of water, electrolytes and buffer depend on the patient's electrolyte and acid-base balance, metabolic status, residual renal function and ongoing physiologic losses through intestinal, respiratory and cutaneous routes.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">PRISMASOL and Phoxillum solutions are supplied in a two-compartment bag made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The 5000 mL bag is composed of a small compartment (250 mL) and a large compartment (4750 mL). The two compartments are separated by a red frangible pin.</p><p>The bag is overwrapped with a transparent overwrap. See Table 2 for the concentrations of the active ingredients in each compartment for each product <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)].</span></p><p>Not all formulations may be marketed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Storage conditions</span></p><p>Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted to 15º-30ºC (59º-86ºF).
