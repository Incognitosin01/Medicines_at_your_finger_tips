</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Hydroxyethyl Starch in Sodium Chloride</h2><p class="First">6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of hypovolemia in adults and children. It is not a substitute for red blood cells or coagulation factors in plasma.</p><h2>Hydroxyethyl Starch in Sodium Chloride Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection is administered by intravenous infusion only</span>.</span> The daily dose and rate of infusion depend on the patient's blood loss, on the maintenance or restoration of hemodynamics and on the hemodilution (dilution effect). 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injectioncan be administered repetitively over several days. [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5)</span>] </p><p>The initial 10 to 20 mL should be infused slowly, keeping the patient under close observation due to possible anaphylactoid reactions. [see <span class="Italics">General Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]</p><h3>Adult Dose</h3><p class="First">Up to 50 mL of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection per kg of body weight per day (equivalent to 3 g hydroxyethyl starch and 7.7 mEq sodium per kg of body weight). This dose is equivalent to 3500 mL of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection for a 70 kg patient.</p><h3>Pediatric Dose</h3><p class="First">The dosage in children should be adapted to the individual patient colloid needs, taking into account the disease state, as well as the hemodynamic and hydration status. </p><p>In 41 newborns to infants (&lt; 2 years), a mean dose of 16 ± 9 mL/kg was administered. In 31 children from 2 to 12 years of age a mean dose of 36 ± 11 mL/kg was administered. The dose in adolescents &gt; 12 is the same as the adult dose.

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Anaphylactoid Reactions</h3><p class="First">Anaphylactoid reactions (mild influenza-like symptoms, bradycardia, tachycardia, bronchospasm, non-cardiac pulmonary edema) have been reported with solutions containing hydroxyethyl starch. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of the drug should be discontinued immediately and the appropriate treatment and supportive measures should be undertaken until symptoms have resolved.  [see <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6)</span></span>]</p><h3>Renal Dysfunction</h3><p class="First">Avoid use in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction.</p><p>Discontinue use of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection at the first sign of renal injury.</p><p>Continue to monitor renal function in hospitalized patients for at least 90 days as use of RRT has been reported up to 90 days after administration of HES products.</p><h3>Coagulopathy</h3><p class="First">Monitor the coagulation status of patients undergoing open heart surgery in association with cardiopulmonary bypass as excess bleeding has been reported with HES solutions in this population. Discontinue use of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection at the first sign of coagulopathy.</p><h3>Fluid Equilibrium</h3><p class="First">Avoid fluid overload; adjust dosage in patients with cardiac or renal dysfunction. Fluid status and rate of infusion should be assessed regularly during treatment, especially in patients with cardiac insufficiency or severe kidney dysfunction.</p><p>In cases of severe dehydration, a crystalloid solution should be given first. Generally, sufficient fluid should be administered in order to avoid dehydration.</p><h3>Monitoring: Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor fluid balance, serum electrolyte concentrations, kidney function, acid-base balance, and coagulation parameters during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the patient's condition warrants such evaluation. Monitor liver function in patients receiving HES products, including 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection.</p><h3>Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Elevated serum amylase levels may be observed temporarily following administration of the product and can interfere with the diagnosis of pancreatitis. </p><p>At high dosages the dilutional effects may result in decreased levels of coagulation factors and other plasma proteins and a decrease in hematocrit.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Overall Adverse Reaction Profile</h3><p class="First">Serious adverse reactions reported in clinical trials include increased mortality and increased use of RRT in critically ill subjects including subjects with sepsis. </p><p>The most common adverse reactions after administration of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection occurring in more than 1% of patients are: pruritus (itching; <span class="Bold">&gt;</span>1% to &lt;10%), elevation of serum amylase (<span class="Bold">&gt;</span>1% to &lt;10%; interference with the diagnosis of pancreatitis), and dilutional effects that may result in decreased levels of coagulation factors and other plasma proteins and in a decrease of hematocrit (<span class="Bold">&gt;</span>1% to &lt;10%).</p><p>Anaphylactoid reactions occur rarely in &lt;0.1% after administration of hydroxyethyl starch solutions. Disturbances of blood coagulation beyond dilution effects can occur rarely in &lt;0.1% depending on the dosage with the administration of hydroxyethyl starch solutions<span class="Sup">1</span>.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug or another patient population and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>During clinical development, a total of 899 subjects received the hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 drug substance at different concentrations (2%, 4%, 6%, or 10%) and at cumulative doses of several mL up to 66 L<span class="Sup">2</span>. Of these 899 subjects, 602 were exposed to 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4. The mean duration of treatment with hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 was 3.7 ± 3.1 days, mean cumulative doses were 3185 ± 3498 mL, and the longest follow-up period was 90 days.</p><p>In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of subjects (N=100) undergoing elective orthopedic surgery, 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection (N=49) or hetastarch (6% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.9% sodium chloride injection; N=51) were administered for intraoperative volume replacement.<span class="Sup">3</span>  Mean infusion volumes were 1613 ± 778 mL for 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection and 1584 ± 958 mL for hetastarch.</p><p>Adverse reactions observed in at least 1% of subjects: In the orthopedic surgery trial conducted in the US, no significant differences in serious adverse reactions were noted overall between the two treatment arms. A possible relationship to 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection was reported in five cases among three subjects (aPTT elevated, PT prolonged, wound hemorrhage, anemia, pruritus); a possible relationship to hetastarch was reported in five subjects (three cases of coagulopathy; two cases of pruritus). The three coagulopathy cases in the hetastarch group were serious and occurred in subjects receiving more than the labeled ceiling dose (20 mL/kg), which is known to increase the risk of bleeding, whereas no serious coagulopathy occurred in the 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection group. Since calculated red blood cell loss for the two treatment arms was not statistically different (95% confidence interval included unity), the difference observed for Factor VIII (see Table 1, below) must be interpreted with caution. An exploratory analysis of total erythrocyte volume transfused (8.0 mL/kg vs. 13.8 mL/kg, 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection vs. hetastarch, respectively) also must be viewed with caution.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Safety Variables for the Orthopedic Surgery Trial conducted in the US</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ratio<br/></span> <span class="Bold">6% hydroxyethyl starch<br/>

</ul><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">The safety and compatibility of other additives have not been established.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C. 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection has been shown to cause embryocidal or other adverse effects in rats and rabbits when given in doses 1.7 times the human dose.</p><p>The type of hydroxyethyl starch present in 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection had no teratogenic properties in rats or rabbits. At 5 g/kg of body weight per day, administered as a bolus injection, fetal retardations and embryolethal effects were observed in rats and rabbits, respectively. In rats, a bolus injection of this dose during pregnancy and lactation reduced body weight of offspring and induced developmental delays. All adverse effects were seen exclusively at maternal toxic doses due to fluid overload. [see <span class="Italics">Animal Pharmacology and/or Toxicology (13.2)</span> ]</p><p>Fertility studies on directly exposed animals have not been conducted. </p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">Information on the use of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection during labor or delivery is unknown. Use if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">In one trial, newborns and infants &lt; 2 years of age undergoing elective surgery were randomized to receive 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection (N=41) or 5% albumin (N=41). The mean dose of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection administered was 16 ± 9 mL/kg.</p><p>In an additional trial, children from 2 - 12 years of age undergoing cardiac surgery were randomized to receive 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection (N=31) or 5% albumin (N=30). The mean dose administered was 36 ± 11 mL/kg.</p><p>Studies conducted in children have not been of sufficient size or follow-up duration to assess the risk of renal injury and mortality in this patient population.</p><p>Dosage in children should be adapted to individual patient colloid needs, taking into account underlying disease, hemodynamics and hydration status.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection (N=471), 32% were <span class="Bold">&gt;</span> 65 years old while 7% were <span class="Bold">&gt;</span> 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection  is mainly excreted by the kidneys, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Volume status, infusion rate, and urine output should be closely monitored. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection.

This effect depends on the mean molecular weight (130,000 daltons; range 110,000 - 150,000 daltons), the molar substitution by hydroxyethyl groups (0.4; range 0.38 - 0.45) on glucose units of the starch, the pattern of hydroxyethyl substitution (C<span class="Sub">2</span>/C<span class="Sub">6</span> ratio) of approximately 9:1, and the concentration (6%), as well as the dosage and infusion rate.</p><p>Hydroxyethyl starch is a derivative of thin boiling waxy corn starch, which mainly consists of a glucose polymer (amylopectin) predominantly composed of alpha-1-4-connected glucose units with several alpha-1-6-branches. Substitution of hydroxyethyl groups on the glucose units of the polymer reduces the normal degradation of amylopectin by alpha-amylase in the body. The low molar substitution (0.4) is the main pharmacological determinant for the beneficial effects of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection on pharmacokinetics, intravascular volume and hemodilution<span class="Sup">8</span>. To describe the molecular weight and molar substitution characteristics of the hydroxyethyl starch in 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection, the compound is designated as hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">After isovolemic exchange of blood with 500 mL of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection in healthy volunteers, blood volume is maintained for at least 6 hours.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetic profile of hydroxyethyl starch is complex and largely dependent on its molar substitution as well as its molecular weight<span class="Sup">8</span>. When administered intravenously, molecules smaller than the renal threshold (60,000-70,000 daltons) are readily and rapidly excreted in the urine, while molecules with higher molecular weights are metabolized by plasma alpha-amylase prior to excretion via the renal route.</p><p>The mean <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> molecular weight of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection in plasma is 70,000 - 80,000 daltons immediately following infusion and remains above the renal threshold throughout the treatment period.</p><p>Following intravenous administration of 500 mL 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection to healthy volunteers, plasma levels of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection remain at 75% of peak concentration at 30 minutes post-infusion and decrease to 14% at 6 hours post-infusion. Plasma levels of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection return to baseline levels 24 hours following infusion. Plasma clearance, volume of distribution, and elimination half-life of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection in healthy volunteers following IV administration of 500 mL were 31.4 mL/min, 5.9 liters, and 12 hours, respectively. Approximately 62% of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection was excreted as hydroxyethyl starch molecules in urine within 72 hours.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection are similar following single and multiple dose administration. No significant plasma accumulation occurred after daily administration of 500 mL of a 10% solution containing hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 over a period of 10 days. Approximately 70% of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection was excreted as hydroxyethyl starch molecules in urine within 72 hours.</p><p class="First">Following a single intravenous administration of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection (500 mL) in subjects with varying degrees of renal dysfunction, the AUC and clearance of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection increased by 73% and decreased by 42% in subjects, respectively, with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min as compared to subjects with creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min. However, terminal half-life and peak hydroxyethyl starch concentration were not affected by renal impairment. Plasma levels of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection returned to baseline levels 24 hours following infusion.

No mutagenic effects were observed with hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 10% solution in the following tests on mutagenic activity: <span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span> reverse mutation assay (<span class="Italics">in vitro</span>), mammalian cells in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> gene mutation assay, assessment of the clastogenic activity in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes (<span class="Italics">in vitro</span>), bone marrow cytogenetic test in Sprague-Dawley rats.</p><p>Fertility studies on directly exposed animals have not been performed.</p><h3>Animal Pharmacology and/or Toxicology</h3><p class="First">Three-month repeat infusion toxicology studies were conducted in rats and dogs in which three groups of animals were administered daily intravenous infusion over three hours. Dosing volumes of either 60 or 90 mL/kg body weight of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (10% solution) or 90 mL/kg 0.9% sodium chloride injection were studied. Observed toxicity following repeat infusion of hydroxyethyl starch is consistent with the oncotic properties of the solution resulting in hypervolemia in the animals. There were no gender-related effects on toxicity following repeat administration of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in rats or dogs.</p><p>In reproduction studies in rats and rabbits, hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (10% solution) had no teratogenic properties. Embryolethal effects were observed in rabbits at 5 g/kg body weight/day. In rats, bolus injection of this dose during pregnancy and lactation reduced body weight of offspring and induced developmental delays. Signs of fluid overload were seen in the dams. Hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (10% solution) had no effect in studies assessing skin sensitization, antigenicity, and blood compatibility.</p><p class="First">The pharmacodynamic effect of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection was examined in a hemorrhagic shock model in conscious rats and a hemodilution model in dogs. In both studies the control group received pentastarch (6% hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5).</p><p>6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection was as effective as pentastarch in maintaining cardiopulmonary function during isovolemic hemodilution in beagle dogs. In the three-hour follow-up period no additional administration of colloid was necessary.</p><p>There were no differences in long-term survival of rats after a single administration of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection and pentastarch solutions following induced hemorrhagic shock (67% and 50% blood loss). In the 67% induced bleeding group receiving 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection (N=6), the survival rate was 83% which is within the normal range for this type of experiment. In the corresponding pentastarch group, survival was 100%. Infusion of Ringer's lactate resulted in a 50% survival rate after a 50% blood loss and a 0% survival after a 67% blood loss.</p><p>After multiple intravenous infusions of 0.7 g per kg body weight per day of 10% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 or 10% hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5 solution during 18 consecutive days, the plasma hydroxyethyl starch concentration in rats treated with hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 was lower compared to rats treated with hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5. Hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 was eliminated faster than hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5. In both groups, clear signs of hydroxyethyl starch tissue storage were detected in lymph nodes and spleen. Numerous empty vacuoles in macrophages were observed. Only minimal cellular vacuolization was found in the liver and kidney. Histochemical differences between the groups were not observed.</p><p>A study with 10% radiolabeled <span class="Sup">14</span>C-hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 and 10% <span class="Sup">14</span>C-hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5 solutions was carried out<span class="Sup">6</span>. In animals treated with hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4, radioactivity decreased from 4.3% of the total administered dose (2.6 g hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 per animal) on day 3 to 0.65% on day 52. In animals treated with hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5, the <span class="Sup">14</span>C-activity decreased from 7.7% of the total administered dose (2.7 g hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5 per animal) on day 3 to 2.45% on day 52. These results confirm the faster elimination and lower persistence of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in tissue.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection was studied in controlled clinical trials among adult and pediatric subjects undergoing various types of surgery (orthopedic, urologic, cardiac) in which hypovolemia is treated (pre-, intra-, and postoperative) or prevented (autologous blood donation, acute normovolemic hemodilution, hypervolemic hemodilution before cardiac surgery). Adult subjects in intensive care units also were studied. The safety and efficacy of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection were compared to other colloidal plasma substitutes [pentastarch (6% hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5), hetastarch (6% hydroxyethyl starch 450/0.7), gelatin solution or human serum albumin]. Perioperative fluid administration of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection ranged from 500 to 4500 mL/day in surgical subjects, and cumulatively, from 6 to 66 L in intensive care subjects following traumatic brain injury.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Orthopedic surgery trial </span></p><p>A multicenter, double-blind RCT in subjects (N=100) undergoing elective orthopedic surgery was conducted in the U.S. to evaluate 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection (N=49) compared with hetastarch (6% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.9% sodium chloride injection) (N=51) for intraoperative volume replacement therapy<span class="Sup">3</span>. The primary efficacy variable, total volume of colloid solution required for intraoperative volume replacement therapy, was equivalent for the two treatment groups. Mean volume infused was 1613 ± 778 mL for 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection and 1584 ± 958.4 mL for hetastarch. The 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection/hetastarch ratio estimate of 1.024 with a 95% CI of 0.84 to 1.25 was within the equivalence range (0.55 to 1.82) prespecified in the study protocol. This indicated that 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection and hetastarch have similar efficacy as intraoperative volume replacement therapy in major orthopedic surgery.</p><p>A second objective of the trial was to show superiority for safety between 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection and hetastarch. Four safety endpoints were prospectively defined and compared in a sequential manner (in order to preserve the type-1 error rate, i.e., observing a difference where none actually exists). Per protocol, if no difference was found between treatment arms for the first safety endpoint (calculated red blood cell loss), the remaining endpoints were to be considered exploratory analyses requiring additional studies for confirmation. [see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials (6.2)</span>]</p><p>There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups with respect to the secondary efficacy endpoints of hemodynamic stability, body temperature, hemodynamic parameters, blood pressure, central venous pressure, heart rate, fibrinogen and platelet count.</p><p>In addition to the US trial, three non-US trials were conducted with the primary objective of showing equivalency (based on mean difference rather than mean ratio as in the US study) between 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection and pentastarch in maintaining or restoring hemodynamic parameters. The largest of the three trials (N=100) met the prespecified boundary (-500 mL, 500 mL), but the two smaller studies (N=52 and N=59) did not.</p><p>In exploratory analyses, the effect of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection on coagulation parameters (von Willebrand factor, Factor VIII, and Ristocetin cofactor) was shown to be significantly lower than pentastarch at one or more time points (US and non-US trials). These findings are consistent with the lower molar substitution, lower average molecular weight and narrower molecular weight distribution of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection as compared to pentastarch resulting in a lower <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> molecular weight and increased elimination from the circulation.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Trials in critically ill adult subjects </span></p><p>A multicenter, double-blind RCT of subjects (N=196) with severe sepsis ≥ 18 years old compared 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection (n=100) with 0.9% sodium chloride (n=96) infused over a maximum of 4 days for volume replacement therapy.<span class="Sup">4</span> The primary endpoint was volume of study drug (mL) required to achieve initial hemodynamic stabilization (HDS). HDS was based on prespecified criteria for MAP, CVP, urine output and central venous oxygen saturation. Acute renal failure was prospectively defined as use of RRT or doubling of baseline serum creatinine at some point during the 90-day observation period. Two scoring systems based on changes in serum creatinine concentration and urine output used to assess severity of acute kidney injury, AKIN (Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3) and RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage kidney disease), also were evaluated.</p><p>In subjects achieving HDS (N=88 vs. 86), significantly less 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection was required to reach HDS compared with 0.9% sodium chloride: 1379 mL ± 886 (6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection) vs. 1709 ± 1164 mL (0.9% sodium chloride), representing a mean difference of 331 mL (95% CI, -640 mL to -21 mL, p=0.02). Less time was needed from start of study drug to achievement of HDS in the 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection group compared with the 0.9% sodium chloride group (11.8 hours ±10.1 hours vs. 14.3 hours ± 11.1 hours, mean ± SD).</p><p>The number of treatment emergent serious adverse events (SAEs)(53 vs. 44) and the number of treatment emergent SAEs leading to death (38 vs. 32) in the 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection and normal saline treatment arms, respectively, during the 90-day observation period did not reach statistical significance.  More 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection subjects than 0.9% sodium chloride subjects were treated with RRT: 21 (21%) vs. 11 (12%) (relative risk, 1.83; 95% CI, 0.95 to 3.58; p=0.08).  Kaplan-Meier curves for time-to-RRT (Figure 1, below) showed a trend against 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection (p=0.064, long-rank test).  The number of subjects meeting AKIN Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 criteria was 21 (21%) vs. 21 (22%), 5 (5%) vs. 6  (6%) and 22 (22%) vs. 17 (18%), 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection vs. 0.9% sodium chloride, respectively.  Corresponding data for RIFLE stages Risk, Injury, and Failure were 13 (13%) vs. 11 (12%), 4 (4%) vs. 5 (5%), and 5 (%) vs. 7 (7%), repsectively.

Secondary outcomes included incidence of acute kidney injury defined by RIFLE criteria, use of RRT, and new organ failure based on SOFA score.  90-day mortality was not different overall (597 (18%) 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection subjects vs. 566 (17%) 0.9% sodium chloride subjects; relative risk, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.18; p=0.26) or in six pre-defined subgroups including subjects with sepsis. Significantly more 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection subjects were treated with RRT: 235 (7.0%) vs. 196 (5.8%)(relative risk, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.45; p=0.04; p=0.05 when adjusted for covariates). In a post hoc analysis, use of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection during the first seven days of therapy was associated with increased serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output; in a pre-planned analysis the number of subjects with RIFLE stages Risk and Injury was less frequent in the 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection vs. 0.9% sodium chloride group:1788 (54.0%) vs. 1912 (57.3%; p=0.007) and 1130 (34.6%) vs. 1253 (38.0%; p=0.005), respectively. There was no statistical difference in RIFLE stage F: 336 (10.4%) vs. 301 (9.2%), 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection vs. 0.9% sodium chloride, respectively. 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride injection subjects experienced lower rates of new cardiovascular organ failure (hypotension) (36.5% vs. 39.9%; relative risk, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84 to 0.99; p=0.03) but an increased SOFA score for hepatic function (bilirubinemia) (1.9% vs. 1.2%; relative risk, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.36; p=0.03). [see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials (6.2)</span>]</p><p>A third multicenter, double-blind RCT performed in severe sepsis subjects (N=804) compared HES 130/0.42 in Ringer’s acetate injection (RA), an HES solution not approved in the U.S. with modified RA for volume replacement therapy. The composite primary endpoint was mortality or dialysis-dependence up to 90 days after randomization. Secondary endpoints included death at 28 days, and acute kidney injury defined as use of RRT, a renal SOFA score ≥3 in subjects with renal SOFA ≤2 (serum creatinine &lt;2.0 mg/dL or urinary output &lt;171 mL per day) at randomization; doubling of serum creatinine. At the end of the 90 day study period, both mortality and use of RRT in the ITT population (N=798) were significantly higher in the HES 130/0.42 treatment arm: 201 (51%) vs. 172 (43%)(relative risk, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.36; p=0.03) and 87 (22%) vs. 65 (16%)(relative risk, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.80; p=0.04), respectively; one subject in each treatment cohort was dependent on dialysis on day 90.  Mortality at 28 days was not different between groups (154 (39%) vs. 144 (36%); relative risk, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.28; p=0.43); use of RRT or renal SOFA score ≥3, and doubling of serum creatinine, were numerically higher in the HES 130/0.42 cohort: 129 (32%) vs. 108 (27%)(relative risk, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.48; p=0.10) and 148 (41%) vs. 127 (35%)(relative risk, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.43; p=0.08), respectively. In a post hoc analysis, the number of subjects with RIFLE Risk, Injury, or Failure was 52 (14%) vs. 73 (20%), 62 (17%) vs. 53 (15%) and 84 (23) vs. 67 (18%),  HES 130/0.42 vs. RA, respectively.
