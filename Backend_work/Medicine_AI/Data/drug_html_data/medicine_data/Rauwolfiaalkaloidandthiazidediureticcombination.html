If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.</p><p>Rauwolfia alkaloids work by controlling nerve impulses along certain nerve pathways. As a result, they act on the heart and blood vessels to lower blood pressure. Thiazide diuretics help to reduce the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine. This also helps to lower blood pressure.</p><p>These medicines are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Although there is no specific information comparing use of these medicines in children with use in other age groups, these medicines are not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than they do in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combinations in the elderly with use in other age groups, rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults. However, drowsiness, dizziness, or faintness or symptoms of too much potassium loss may be more likely to occur in the elderly, who are more sensitive to the effects of rauwolfia alkaloids and thiazide diuretics.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Too much use of thiazide diuretics (contained in this combination medicine) during pregnancy may cause unwanted effects including jaundice, blood problems, and low potassium in the baby. Too much use of rauwolfia alkaloids may cause difficult breathing, low temperature, and loss of appetite in the baby. Rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination has not been shown to cause birth defects in humans. In rats, use of rauwolfia alkaloids during pregnancy decreases newborn survival rates. Be sure that you have discussed this with your doctor before taking rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Rauwolfia alkaloids pass into breast milk and may cause unwanted effects (difficult breathing, low temperature, loss of appetite) in infants of mothers taking it in large doses. Thiazide diuretics also pass into breast milk. Be sure you have discussed this with your doctor before taking rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination</h2><p>In addition to the use of the medicine your doctor has prescribed, treatment for your high blood pressure may include weight control and care in the types of foods you eat, especially foods high in sodium. Your doctor will tell you which of these are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet.</p><p>Many patients who have high blood pressure will not notice any signs of the problem. In fact, many may feel normal. It is very important that you <i>take your medicine exactly as directed</i> and that you keep your appointments with your doctor even if you feel well.</p><p>Remember that rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination will not cure your high blood pressure but it does help control it. Therefore, you must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. <i>You may have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life</i>. If high blood pressure is not treated, it can cause serious problems such as heart failure, blood vessel disease, stroke, or kidney disease.</p><p>Rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination may cause you to have an unusual feeling of tiredness when you begin to take it. You may also notice an increase in the amount of urine or in your frequency of urination. After you have taken the medicine for a while, these effects should lessen. In general, to keep the increase in urine from affecting your sleep:</p><ul>
<li>If you are to take a single dose a day, take it in the morning after breakfast.</li>
<li>If you are to take more than one dose a day, take the last dose no later than 6 p.m., unless otherwise directed by your doctor.</li>
</ul><p>However, it is best to plan your dose or doses according to a schedule that will least affect your personal activities and sleep. Ask your health care professional to help you plan the best time to take rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination.</p><p>To help you remember to take your medicine, try to get into the habit of taking it at the same time each day.</p><p>If rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination upsets your stomach, it may be taken with meals or milk. If stomach upset (nausea, vomiting, stomach pain or cramps) continues, check with your doctor.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>For deserpidine and hydrochlorothiazide combination

This especially includes over-the-counter (nonprescription) medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems, since they may tend to increase your blood pressure.</p><p>Before having any kind of surgery (including dental surgery), or emergency treatment, <i>tell the medical doctor or dentist in charge that you are taking rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination</i>.</p><p>Rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination may cause a loss of potassium from your body.</p><ul>
<li>To help prevent this, your doctor may want you to:
<ul>
<li>eat or drink foods that have a high potassium content (for example, orange or other citrus fruit juices), or</li>
<li>take a potassium supplement, or</li>
<li>take another medicine to help prevent the loss of the potassium in the first place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is very important to follow these directions. Also, it is important not to change your diet on your own. This is more important if you are already on a special diet (as for diabetes), or if you are taking a potassium supplement or a medicine to reduce potassium loss. Extra potassium may not be necessary and, in some cases, too much potassium could be harmful.</li>

If the problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.</p><p>The dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting is also more likely to occur if you drink alcohol, stand for a long time, exercise, or if the weather is hot. <i>While you are taking rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination, be careful to limit the amount of alcohol you drink. Also, use extra care during exercise or hot weather or if you must stand for a long time</i>.</p><p>In some patients, rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination may cause mental depression. <i>Tell your doctor right away</i>:</p><ul>
<li>if you or anyone else notices unusual changes in your moods.</li>
<li>if you start having early-morning sleeplessness or unusually vivid dreams or nightmares.</li>
</ul><p>Rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that slow down the nervous system, possibly causing drowsiness). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds; sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine; prescription pain medicine or narcotics; barbiturates; medicine for seizures; muscle relaxants; or anesthetics, including dental anesthetics. <i>Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are taking rauwolfia alkaloid and thiazide diuretic combination</i>.</p><p>For <i>diabetic patients</i>:</p><ul>
