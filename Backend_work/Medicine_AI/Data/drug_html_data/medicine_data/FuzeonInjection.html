</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Fuzeon Injection</h2><p class="First">FUZEON<span class="Sup">®</span> in combination with other antiretroviral agents is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced patients with evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy.</p><p>This indication is based on results from two controlled studies of 48 weeks duration. Subjects enrolled were treatment-experienced adults; many had advanced disease. There are no studies of FUZEON in antiretroviral naive subjects.</p><h2>Fuzeon Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Adults</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of FUZEON is 90 mg (1 mL) twice daily injected subcutaneously into the upper arm, anterior thigh or abdomen. Each injection should be given at a site different from the preceding injection site, and only where there is no current injection site reaction from an earlier dose. FUZEON should not be injected near any anatomical areas where large nerves course close to the skin, such as near the elbow, knee, groin or the inferior or medial section of the buttocks, skin abnormalities, including directly over a blood vessel, into moles, scar tissue, bruises, or near the navel, surgical scars, tattoos or burn sites. Additional detailed information regarding the administration of FUZEON is described in the FUZEON <span class="Italics">Injection Instructions.</span></p><h3>Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">Insufficient data are available to establish a dose recommendation of FUZEON in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years. In pediatric patients 6 years through 16 years of age, the recommended dosage of FUZEON is 2 mg/kg twice daily up to a maximum dose of 90 mg twice daily injected subcutaneously into the upper arm, anterior thigh or abdomen. Each injection should be given at a site different from the preceding injection site and only where there is no current injection site reaction from an earlier dose. FUZEON should not be injected into moles, scar tissue, bruises or the navel. Table 1 contains dosing guidelines for FUZEON based on body weight. Weight should be monitored periodically and the FUZEON dose adjusted accordingly.</p><h3>Directions for Use</h3><p class="First">For more detailed instructions, see FUZEON <span class="Italics">Injection Instructions.</span></p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Subcutaneous Administration</span></p><p>FUZEON must only be reconstituted with 1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection provided in the Convenience Kit. After adding sterile water, the vial should be gently tapped for 10 seconds and then gently rolled between the hands to avoid foaming and to ensure all particles of drug are in contact with the liquid and no drug remains on the vial wall. The vial should then be allowed to stand until the powder goes completely into solution, which could take up to 45 minutes. Reconstitution time can be reduced by gently rolling the vial between the hands until the product is completely dissolved. Before the solution is withdrawn for administration, the vial should be inspected visually to ensure that the contents are fully dissolved in solution, and that the solution is clear, colorless and without bubbles or particulate matter. If the FUZEON is foamy or jelled, allow more time for it to dissolve. If there is evidence of particulate matter, the vial must not be used and should be returned to the pharmacy.</p><p>FUZEON contains no preservatives. Once reconstituted, FUZEON should be injected immediately or kept refrigerated in the original vial until use. Reconstituted FUZEON must be used within 24 hours. The subsequent dose of FUZEON can be reconstituted in advance and must be stored in the refrigerator in the original vial and used within 24 hours. Refrigerated reconstituted solution should be brought to room temperature before injection and the vial should be inspected visually again to ensure that the contents are fully dissolved in solution and that the solution is clear, colorless, and without bubbles or particulate matter.</p><p>A vial is suitable for single use only; unused portions must be discarded (see FUZEON <span class="Italics">Injection Instructions</span>).</p><p>Patients should contact their healthcare provider for any questions regarding the administration of FUZEON. Information about the self-administration of FUZEON may also be obtained by calling the toll-free number 1-877-4-FUZEON (1-877-438-9366) or at the FUZEON website, www.FUZEON.com. Patients should be taught to recognize the signs and symptoms of injection site reactions and instructed when to contact their healthcare provider about these reactions.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Lyophilized powder for injection: 108 mg enfuvirtide per vial</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">FUZEON is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to FUZEON or any of its components <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Local Injection Site Reactions (ISRs)</h3><p class="First">The majority of subjects (98%) receiving FUZEON in randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter clinical trials had at least one local injection site reaction; ISRs occurred throughout treatment with FUZEON. Manifestations may include pain and discomfort, induration, erythema, nodules and cysts, pruritus, and ecchymosis <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>. Reactions are often present at more than one injection site. Patients must be familiar with the FUZEON <span class="Italics">Injection Instructions</span> in order to know how to inject FUZEON appropriately and how to monitor carefully for signs or symptoms of cellulitis or local infection.</p><h3>Administration with Biojector® 2000</h3><p class="First">Nerve pain (neuralgia and/or paresthesia) lasting up to 6 months associated with administration at anatomical sites where large nerves course close to the skin, bruising and hematomas have occurred with use of the Biojector 2000 needle-free device for administration of FUZEON. Patients receiving anticoagulants or persons with hemophilia, or other coagulation disorders, may have a higher risk of post-injection bleeding.</p><h3>Pneumonia</h3><p class="First">An increased rate of bacterial pneumonia was observed in subjects treated with FUZEON in the Phase 3 clinical trials compared to the control arm. The incidence of pneumonia was 2.7% or 3.2 events/100 patient-years in subjects receiving FUZEON+background regimen. On analysis of all diagnoses of pneumonia (pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, and related terms) in T20-301 and T20-302, an increased rate of bacterial pneumonia was observed in subjects treated with FUZEON compared to the control arm (6.9%, 6.7 pneumonia events per 100 patient-years versus 0.6 events per 100 patient-years, respectively). Approximately half of the study subjects with pneumonia required hospitalization. Three subject deaths in the FUZEON arm were attributed to pneumonia; all three had serious concomitant AIDS-related illnesses that contributed to their deaths. Risk factors for pneumonia included low initial CD4 lymphocyte count, high initial viral load, intravenous drug use, smoking, and a prior history of lung disease.</p><p>Because it was unclear whether the higher incidence rate of pneumonia was related to FUZEON use, an observational study in 1850 HIV-infected patients (740 FUZEON treated patients and 1110 non-FUZEON treated patients) was conducted to evaluate the risk of pneumonia in patients treated with FUZEON. A total of 123 patients had a confirmed or probable pneumonia event in this study (62 in the FUZEON treatment arm with 1962 patient-years of observation and 61 in the non-FUZEON treatment arm with 3378 patient-years of observation). The incidence of pneumonia was 3.2 events/100 patient-years in the FUZEON treatment arm and 1.8 events/100 patient-years in the non-FUZEON treatment arm. The hazard ratio, adjusting for other baseline risk factors, was 1.34 (95% C.I. = 0.90 – 2.00). Based on this observational study, it is not possible to exclude an increased risk of pneumonia in patients treated with FUZEON compared to non-FUZEON treated patients.</p><p>It is unclear if the increased incidence of pneumonia is related to FUZEON use. However, because of these findings, patients with HIV-1 infection should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonia, especially if they have underlying conditions which may predispose them to pneumonia. Risk factors for pneumonia included low initial CD4 cell count, high initial viral load, intravenous drug use, smoking, and a prior history of lung disease.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Systemic hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with FUZEON therapy and may recur on re-challenge. Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred in &lt;1% of subjects studied and have included combinations of: rash, fever, nausea and vomiting, chills, rigors, hypotension, and/or elevated serum liver transaminases. Other adverse events that may be immune mediated and have been reported in subjects receiving FUZEON include primary immune complex reaction, respiratory distress, glomerulonephritis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Patients developing signs and symptoms suggestive of a systemic hypersensitivity reaction should discontinue FUZEON and should seek medical evaluation immediately. Therapy with FUZEON should not be restarted following systemic signs and symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction. Risk factors that may predict the occurrence or severity of hypersensitivity to FUZEON have not been identified.</p><h3>Non-HIV Infected Individuals</h3><p class="First">There is a theoretical risk that FUZEON use may lead to the production of anti-enfuvirtide antibodies which cross react with HIV gp41. This could result in a false positive HIV test with an ELISA assay; a confirmatory western blot test would be expected to be negative. FUZEON has not been studied in non-HIV infected individuals.</p><h3>Immune Reconstitution Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including FUZEON. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium avium</span> infection, cytomegalovirus, <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span> pneumonia [PCP] or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.</p><p>Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections:</p><ul>

<li>Pneumonia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
<li>Hypersensitivity Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The overall safety profile of FUZEON is based on 2131 subjects who received at least 1 dose of FUZEON during various clinical trials. This includes 2051 adults, 658 of whom received the recommended dose for greater than 48 weeks, and 63 pediatric subjects.</p><p>Assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events is based on the pooled data from the two randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter trials in treatment-experienced subjects, T20-301 (TORO 1) and T20-302 (TORO 2).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Local Injection Site Reactions</span></p><p>Local injection site reactions were the most frequent adverse events associated with the use of FUZEON. In T20-301 and T20-302, 98% of subjects had at least one local injection site reaction (ISR). A total of 7% of subjects discontinued treatment with FUZEON because of ISRs (4%) or difficulties with injecting FUZEON (3%) such as injection fatigue and inconvenience. Eighty-five percent of subjects experienced their first ISR during the initial week of treatment; ISRs continued to occur throughout treatment with FUZEON. For most subjects the severity of signs and symptoms associated with ISRs did not change during the 48 weeks of treatment. The majority of ISRs were associated with erythema, induration, the presence of nodules or cysts, and mild to moderate pain at the injection site (Table 2). In addition, the average duration of individual ISRs was between three and seven days in 41% of subjects and more than seven days in 24% of subjects. Also, the numbers of ISRs per subject at any one time was between six to 14 ISRs in 26% of subjects and more than 14 ISRs in 1.3% of subjects. Infection at the injection site (including abscess and cellulitis) was reported in 1.7% of adult subjects.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Other Adverse Events</span></p><p>In T20-301 and T20-302, after study week 8, subjects on background alone who met protocol defined criteria for virological failure were permitted to revise their background regimens and add FUZEON. Exposure on FUZEON+background was 557 patient-years, and to background alone 162 patient-years. Due to this difference in exposure, safety results are expressed as the number of patients with an adverse event per 100 patient-years of exposure. For FUZEON+background, adverse events are also displayed by percent of subjects.</p><p>The events most frequently reported in subjects receiving FUZEON+background regimen, excluding ISRs, were diarrhea (38 per 100 patient-years or 31.7%), nausea (27 per 100 patient-years or 22.8%), and fatigue (24 per 100 patient-years or 20.2%). These events were also commonly observed in subjects that received background regimen alone: diarrhea (73 per 100 patient-years), nausea (50 per 100 patient-years), and fatigue (38 per 100 patient-years).</p><p>Treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of causality and excluding ISRs, from Phase 3 studies are summarized for adult subjects, in Table 3. Any Grade 2 or above events occurring at ≥2 percent of subjects and at a higher rate in subjects treated with FUZEON are summarized in Table 3; events that occurred at a higher rate in the control arms are not displayed.</p><p>Rates of adverse events for subjects who switched to FUZEON after virological failure were similar.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Less Common Events</span></p><p>The following adverse events have been reported in 1 or more subjects; however, a causal relationship to FUZEON has not been established.</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune System Disorders:</span> worsening abacavir hypersensitivity reaction</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal and Urinary Disorders:</span> glomerulonephritis; tubular necrosis; renal insufficiency; renal failure (including fatal cases)</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood and Lymphatic Disorders:</span> thrombocytopenia; neutropenia; fever; lymphadenopathy</p><p><span class="Italics">Endocrine and Metabolic:</span> hyperglycemia</p><p><span class="Italics">Infections:</span> sepsis; herpes simplex</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System Disorders:</span> taste disturbance; Guillain-Barre syndrome (fatal); sixth nerve palsy; peripheral neuropathy</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiac Disorders:</span> unstable angina pectoris</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal Disorders:</span> constipation; abdominal pain upper</p><p><span class="Italics">General:</span> asthenia</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatobiliary Disorders:</span> toxic hepatitis; hepatic steatosis</p><p><span class="Italics">Investigations:</span> increased amylase; increased lipase; increased AST; increased GGT; increased triglycerides</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric Disorders:</span> insomnia; depression; anxiety; suicide attempt</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders:</span> pneumopathy; respiratory distress; cough</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:</span> pruritus</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Laboratory Abnormalities</span></p><p>Table 4 shows the treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities that occurred in at least 2 subjects per 100 patient-years and more frequently in those receiving FUZEON+background regimen than background regimen alone from T20-301 and T20-302.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Events in Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>FUZEON has been studied in 63 pediatric subjects 5 through 16 years of age with duration of FUZEON exposure ranging from 1 dose to 134 weeks. Adverse experiences seen during clinical trials were similar to those observed in adult subjects, although infections at site of injection (cellulitis or abscess) were more frequent in adolescents than in adults, with 4 events occurring in 3 of 28 (11%) subjects.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reaction has been identified during postapproval use of FUZEON. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders</span></p><p>Cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">See also Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</p><h3>Potential for FUZEON to Affect Other Drugs</h3><p class="First">Based on the results from an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human microsomal study, enfuvirtide is not an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes. In an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> human metabolism study (N=12), FUZEON at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily did not alter the metabolism of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19 or CYP2E1 substrates.</p><h3>Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Enfuvirtide</h3><p class="First">Based on the available data, co-administration of FUZEON and other drugs which are inducers or inhibitors of CYP450 is not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide. No dose adjustments are needed when FUZEON is co-administered with other antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral drugs.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category B</span></p><p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 27 times and 3.2 times the adult human dose on a m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to enfuvirtide. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry</span></p><p>To monitor maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to FUZEON and other antiretroviral drugs, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 1-800-258-4263.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-infected mothers not breast-feed their infants to avoid the risk of postnatal transmission of HIV.</span> It is not known whether enfuvirtide is excreted in human milk. Because of both the potential for HIV transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, <span class="Bold">mothers should be instructed not to breast-feed if they are receiving FUZEON.</span></p><p>Studies where radio-labeled <span class="Sup">3</span>H-enfuvirtide was administered to lactating rats indicated that radioactivity was present in the milk. It is not known whether the radioactivity in the milk was from radio-labeled enfuvirtide or from radio-labeled metabolites of enfuvirtide (i.e., amino acids and peptide fragments).</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and pharmacokinetics of FUZEON have been evaluated in the age groups of 6 to 16 years of age supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of FUZEON in adults. Limited efficacy data are available in pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Sixty-three HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects ages 5 through 16 years have received FUZEON in two open-label, single-arm clinical trials. Adverse experiences, including ISRs, were similar to those observed in adult subjects.</p><p>T20-204 was an open-label, multicenter trial that evaluated the safety and antiviral activity of FUZEON in treatment-experienced pediatric subjects. Eleven subjects from 6 to 12 years were enrolled (median age of 9 years). Median baseline CD4 cell count was 495 cells/µL and the median baseline HIV-1 RNA was 4.6 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL.</p><p>Ten of the 11 study subjects completed 48 weeks of chronic therapy. At week 48, 6/11 (55%) subjects had ≥1 log<span class="Sub">10</span> decline in HIV-1 RNA and 4/11 (36%) subjects were below 400 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA. The median changes from baseline (for the As Treated population) in HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count were -1.48 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL and +122 cells/µL, respectively.</p><p>T20-310 was an open-label, multicenter trial that evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, and antiviral activity of FUZEON in treatment-experienced pediatric subjects and adolescents. Fifty-two subjects from 5 through 16 years were enrolled (median age of 12 years). Median baseline CD4 cell count was 117 cells/µL and the median baseline HIV-1 RNA was 5.0 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL.</p><p>Thirty-two of the 52 study subjects completed 48 weeks of chronic therapy. At week 48, 17/52 (33%) of subjects had ≥1 log<span class="Sub">10</span> decline in HIV-1 RNA, 11/52 (21%) of subjects were below 400 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA and 5/52 (10%) were below 50 copies/mL. The median changes from baseline (for the As Treated population) in HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count were -1.17 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL and +106 cells/µL, respectively.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of FUZEON did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, appropriate caution should be exercised in the administration and monitoring of FUZEON in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dose adjustments of enfuvirtide are needed in patients with hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Use in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dose adjustments of enfuvirtide are needed in patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There are no reports of human experience of acute overdose with FUZEON. The highest dose administered to 12 subjects in a clinical trial was 180 mg as a single dose subcutaneously. There is no specific antidote for overdose with FUZEON. Treatment of overdose should consist of general supportive measures.</p><h2>Fuzeon Injection Description</h2><p class="First">FUZEON (enfuvirtide) is an inhibitor of the fusion of HIV-1 with CD4 cells. Enfuvirtide is a linear 36-amino acid synthetic peptide with the N-terminus acetylated and the C-terminus is a carboxamide. It is composed of naturally occurring L-amino acid residues.</p><p>Enfuvirtide is a white to off-white amorphous solid. It has negligible solubility in pure water and the solubility increases in aqueous buffers (pH 7.5) to 85-142 g/100 mL. The empirical formula of enfuvirtide is C<span class="Sub">204</span>H<span class="Sub">301</span>N<span class="Sub">51</span>O<span class="Sub">64</span>, and the molecular weight is 4492.

Each single-use vial contains 108 mg of enfuvirtide for the delivery of 90 mg. Prior to subcutaneous administration, the contents of the vial are reconstituted with 1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection to provide the delivery of 1 mL of the solution. Each 1 mL of the reconstituted solution contains approximately 90 mg of enfuvirtide with approximate amounts of the following excipients: 22.55 mg of mannitol, 2.39 mg of sodium carbonate (anhydrous), and sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment as needed. The reconstituted solution has an approximate pH of 9.0.</p><h2>Fuzeon Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Enfuvirtide is an antiviral drug <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetic properties of enfuvirtide were evaluated in HIV-1 infected adult and pediatric subjects.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following a 90-mg single subcutaneous injection of FUZEON into the abdomen in 12 HIV-1 infected subjects, the mean (±SD) C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 4.59 ± 1.5 µg/mL, AUC was 55.8 ± 12.1 µg∙h/mL and the median T<span class="Sub">max</span> was 8 hours (ranged from 3 to 12 h).
