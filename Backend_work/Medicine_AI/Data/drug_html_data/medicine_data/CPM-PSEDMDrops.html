Chemically, it is Morphinan, 3-methoxy-17- methyl-, (9α, 13α, 14α)-, hydrobromide, monohydrate. Its structure is as follows:</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">25</span>NO • HBr • H<span class="Sub">2</span>O                       M.W. 370.32</p><p>Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is an adrenergic (vasoconstrictor) which occurs as fine, white to off white crystals or powder, having a faint characteristic odor. It is very soluble in water, freely soluble in alcohol and sparing soluble in chloroform. The chemical name is: benzenemethanol, α-[1-(methylamino)ethyl]-[ <span class="Italics">S</span>-(<span class="Italics">R*,R*</span>)-, hydrochloride. Its structure is as follows:</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">C<span class="Sub">10</span>H<span class="Sub">15</span>NO • HCl                              M.W. 201.69</p><h2>CPM-PSE DM Drops - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Chlorpheniramine</h3><p class="First">Chlorpheniramine Maleate is an alkylamine-type antihistamine that possesses anticholineric and sedative effects. Antihistamines competitively antagonize histamine at the H<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor site. Thus, activation of H<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors by released histamine which results in increased vascular permeability, increased mucus production, pruritus and sneezing is prevented.</p><h3>Dextromethorphan</h3><p class="First">Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide is an antitussive agent which, unlike the isomeric levorphanol, has no analgesic or addictive properties. The drug acts centrally and elevates the threshold for coughing. It is about equal to codeine in depressing the cough reflex. In therapeutic dosage, Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide does not inhibit ciliary activity. Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, metabolized by the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.</p><h3>Pseudoephedrine</h3><p class="First">Pseudoephedrine acts as an indirect sympathomimetic agent by stimulating sympathetic (adrenergic) nerve endings to release norepinephrine. Norepinephrine in turn stimulates alpha and beta receptors throughout the body. The action of Pseudoephedrine is apparently more specific for the blood vessels of the upper respiratory tract and less specific for the blood vessels of the systemic circulation. The vasoconstriction elicited at these sites results in the shrinkage of swollen tissues in the sinuses and nasal passages. Pseudoephedrine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Considerable variation in half-life has been observed (from about 4 1/2 to 10 hours), which is attributed to individual differences in absorption and excretion. Excretion rates are also altered by urine pH, increasing with acidification and decreasing with alkalinization. As a result, mean half-life falls to about 4 hours at pH 5 and increases to 12 to 13 hours at pH 8.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Temporarily relieves symptoms due to the common cold, hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or other upper respiratory allergies; runny nose, sneezing, itching of the nose or throat, itchy, watery eyes, cough due to minor throat and bronchial irritation, nasal congestion, reduces swelling of nasal passages.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Do not exceed recommended dosage.</span></p><p>Do not use this product under 4 years of age.</p><p>Do not use this product in a child who is taking a prescription monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI)(certain drugs for depression, psychiatric, or emotional conditions, or Parkinson's disease), or for 2 weeks after stopping the MAOI drug.
