This requested voluntary withdrawal does not impact approved topical or ophthalmic drugs that contain bacitracin. Further information may be found at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-requests-withdrawal-bacitracin-injection-market.</p><p><b>Pneumonia and empyema; staphylococcal: Note:</b> Due to toxicity risks, systemic use of bacitracin should be limited to situations where less toxic alternatives would not be effective; systemic use in pediatric patients is rare. <b>Do not administer IV</b>:</p><p>Infants: IM:</p><p>≤2.5 kg: 900 units/kg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses.</p><p>&gt;2.5 kg: 1,000 units/kg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Solution for injection (IM use only): Store unreconstituted vials in the refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Once reconstituted, bacitracin is stable for 1 week under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>BCG (Intravesical): Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of BCG (Intravesical). <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>BCG Vaccine (Immunization): Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of BCG Vaccine (Immunization). <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Cholera Vaccine: Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Cholera Vaccine.

Only the live attenuated Ty21a strain is affected.  Management: Avoid use of live attenuated typhoid vaccine (Ty21a)  in patients being treated with systemic antibacterial agents. Postpone vaccination until 3 days after cessation of antibiotics and avoid starting antibiotics within 3 days of last vaccine dose.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Frequency not defined.</p><p>Dermatologic: Skin rash</p><p>Endocrine &amp; metabolic: Albuminuria</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting</p><p>Genitourinary: Azotemia, casts in urine, nephrotoxicity</p><p>Local: Pain at injection site</p><p>Renal: Renal failure</p><p>Postmarketing and/or case reports: Anaphylaxis (intraoperative exposure [Damm, 2011])</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">ALERT: U.S. Boxed Warning</h2><p>Bacitracin in parenteral (IM) therapy may cause renal failure due to tubular and glomerular necrosis. Its use should be restricted to infants with staphylococcal pneumonia and empyema when due to organisms shown to be susceptible to bacitracin. It should be used only where adequate laboratory facilities are available and when constant supervision of the patient is possible.</p><p>Renal function should be carefully determined prior to and daily during therapy. The recommended daily dose should not be exceeded, and fluid intake and urinary output should be maintained at proper levels to avoid kidney toxicity. If renal toxicity occurs the drug should be discontinued. The concurrent use of other nephrotoxic drugs, particularly streptomycin, kanamycin, polymyxin B, polymyxin E (colistin), and neomycin should be avoided.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Anaphylaxis: Use with caution in patients who have been previously exposed to bacitracin; anaphylactic reactions have occurred on repeat exposure especially with irrigation use (Damm 2011; Elsner 1990; Farley 1995).</p><p>• Renal failure: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: IM use may cause renal failure due to tubular and glomerular necrosis; monitor renal function daily.</b> Avoid concurrent use with other nephrotoxic drugs; discontinue use if toxicity occurs; maintain adequate fluid intake and urine output throughout therapy. Do not exceed recommended doses.</p><p>• Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including <i>C. difficile</i>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed &gt;2 months postantibiotic treatment.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Do not administer intravenously because severe thrombophlebitis occurs.</p><p>• Monitoring: Should only be used when adequate laboratory facilities are available and constant patient supervision is available.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>IM: Urinalysis, renal function tests, urine output</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>This product is not indicated for use in women of reproductive age. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>This product is not indicated for use in women of reproductive age.</p><h2>More about bacitracin</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
