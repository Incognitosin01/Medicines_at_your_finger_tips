</ul><h2>Baricon Suspension Description</h2><p class="First">Baricon is a lemon-vanilla flavored, high density barium sulfate formulation for aqueous suspension and use as a contrast medium in double contrast stomach examinations.<br/></p><p>The product contains 98% w/w barium sulfate USP, sucrose, simethicone, suspending agents, sorbitol, flavoring, sodium citrate and saccharin sodium. Barium sulfate has the empirical formula of BaSO<span class="Sub">4</span>.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>Baricon Suspension - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p>Barium sulfate is an insoluble material which, because of its density, provides a positive contrast during x-ray examination. Barium sulfate is an inert radiopaque material which is not absorbed or metabolized and is eliminated intact from the body in a manner similar to other non-absorbed inorganic materials. Excretion rate is a function of gastrointestinal transit time.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Baricon Suspension</h2><p>Baricon is indicated for use as a contrast medium in double contrast stomach examinations.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Serious adverse reactions, including death, have been reported with the administration of barium sulfate formulations and are usually associated with the technique of administration, the underlying pathological condition and/or patient hypersensitivities.<br/>
<br/>
Vomiting following oral administration of barium sulfate may lead to aspiration pneumonitis. Cardiopulmonary arrest leading to fatality has been reported in infants following aspiration. Oral administration of barium sulfate suspension by an infant sucking a bottle and administration of large quantities by catheter are reported to be likely to result in aspiration into the tracheobronchial tree. Aspiration of smaller amounts may cause inflammation.<br/>
<br/>
Barium sulfate preparations used as radiopaque media contain a number of additives to provide diagnostic properties and patient palatability. Allergic responses following the use of barium sulfate suspensions have been reported. Skin irritation, redness, inflammation and hives have been reported for infants and small children following spillage of barium sulfate suspension on their skin. These responses are thought to be caused by the flavors and/or preservatives used in the product.<br/>
<br/>
Barium sulfate suspension has been reported to cause obstruction of the small bowel (impaction) in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis. It has also been reported to cause fluid overload from the absorption of water during studies in infants when Hirschsprung’s Disease is suspected.<br/></p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Diagnostic procedures which involve the use of radiopaque contrast agents should be carried out under the direction of personnel with the requisite training and with a thorough knowledge of the particular procedure to be performed. A history of bronchial asthma, atopy, as evidenced by hay fever and eczema, a family history of allergy, or a previous reaction to a contrast agent warrant special attention. Caution should be exercised with the use of radiopaque media in severely debilitated patients and in those with marked hypertension or advanced cardiac disease.<br/>
<br/>
Anaphylactic and allergic reactions have been reported during double contrast examinations in which glucagon has been used.<br/>
<br/>
Ingestion of barium sulfate suspension is not recommended in patients with a history of food aspiration. If barium sulfate suspension is aspirated into the larynx, further administration of the suspension should be immediately discontinued.<br/>
<br/>
Patient preparation for diagnostic gastrointestinal examination frequently requires cathartics and a liquid diet. The various preparations can result in water loss for the patient. Patients should be rehydrated quickly following a barium sulfate suspension examination of the gastrointestinal tract.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Safe use of barium sulfate during pregnancy has not been established. Barium sulfate should be used in pregnant women only if the possible benefits outweigh the potential risks. Elective radiography of the abdomen is considered to be contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk to the fetus from radiation exposure. Radiation is known to cause harm to the unborn fetus exposed in utero.<br/></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Postmarketing Experiences</h3><p class="First">The following adverse experiences have been reported in patients receiving products containing barium sulfate. These adverse experiences are listed alphabetically: abdominal cramping, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, foreign body trauma relating to procedural complications, headache, laryngeal burning and irritation, leukocytosis, nausea, procedural site reactions, rash and vomiting.<br/></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In rare instances, immediate repeat oral examinations utilizing standard dosages may lead to severe stomach cramps and diarrhea. Cases reported implicate a total dose in the range of 30 ounces (900 mL) of suspension. Instances of this type have resolved spontaneously and they are not considered to be life-threatening.</p><h2>Baricon Suspension Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Patient Preparation</h3><p class="First">Successful examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract requires that the stomach be empty and essentially free of fluid. This can usually be accomplished by instructing the patient to abstain from eating or drinking anything after the evening meal before the examination. The preparation for small bowel examinations, done separately or combined with an upper gastrointestinal series, is the same.</p><h3>Mixing Directions:</h3><h2>ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">While techniques may vary, it is suggested that the patient place a gas producing agent such as sodium bicarbonate on the tongue and wash down with 10 mL of water. Immediately following the sodium bicarbonate and while the patient is in the upright position, have the patient drink the Baricon Suspension. Instruct the patient not to burp. (Depending upon physician preference, the barium sulfate suspension may be given prior to sodium bicarbonate).<br/>
