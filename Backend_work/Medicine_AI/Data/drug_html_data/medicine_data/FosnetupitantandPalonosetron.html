Palonosetron is a selective 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, which blocks serotonin, both on vagal nerve terminals in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Palonosetron inhibits the cross-talk between the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> and NK<sub>1</sub> receptors. The combination of palonosetron and netupitant works synergistically to inhibit substance P response to a greater extent than either agent alone (Aapro 2014).</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>V<sub>d</sub>: Fosnetupitant: 296 ± 535 L; Palonosetron: 594 ± 239 L</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Fosnetupitant is a prodrug and is converted by hydrolysis to netupitant; Netupitant is metabolized extensively hepatic via CYP3A4 (major), CYP2C9 (minor) and CYP2D6 (minor); forms active metabolites M1, M2, and M3</p><p>Palonosetron is ~50% metabolized to relatively inactive metabolites (N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron); CYP2D6, 3A4, and 1A2 contribute to metabolism</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Fosnetupitant: Fosnetupitant is a prodrug of netupitant (plasma fosnetupitant concentrations rapidly decline shortly after infusion); Netupitant: Feces (~71%); urine (~4%); Palonosetron: Feces (5% to 8%); urine (85% to 93%; 40% as unchanged drug)</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>At end of the 30-minute infusion</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Fosnetupitant: 0.75 ± 0.4 hours; Netupitant: 144 ± 73 hours; Palonosetron: 58 ± 27 hours</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>Fosnetupitant: 92% to 95%; Palonosetron: ~62%</p><h2>Special Populations: Hepatic Function Impairment</h2><p>Fosnetupitant is a prodrug of netupitant.

Some of the cases have been fatal. The majority of serotonin syndrome reports with 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists occurred in a postanesthesia setting or in an infusion center. Serotonin syndrome has also been reported following overdose of another 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist. Monitor patients for signs of serotonin syndrome, including mental status changes (eg, agitation, hallucinations, delirium, coma); autonomic instability (eg, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, diaphoresis, dizziness, flushing, hyperthermia); neuromuscular changes (eg, tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination); gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea); and/or seizures. If serotonin syndrome occurs, discontinue 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist treatment and begin supportive management.</p><p><i><b>Disease-related concerns:</b></i></p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Avoid use in severe hepatic impairment.
