</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Vivelle-Dot</h2><p>Estrogens are female hormones. They are produced by the body and are necessary for the normal sexual development of the female and for the regulation of the menstrual cycle during the childbearing years.</p><p>The ovaries begin to produce less estrogen after menopause (the change of life). This medicine is prescribed to make up for the lower amount of estrogen. Estrogens help relieve signs of menopause, such as hot flashes and unusual sweating, chills, faintness, or dizziness.</p><p>Estrogens are prescribed for several reasons:</p><ul>
<li>To provide additional hormone when the body does not produce enough of its own, such as during menopause or when female puberty (development of female sexual organs) does not occur on time. Other conditions include a genital skin condition (vulvar atrophy), inflammation of the vagina (atrophic vaginitis), or ovary problems (female hypogonadism or failure or removal of both ovaries).</li>
<li>To help prevent weakening of bones (osteoporosis) in women past menopause.</li>
<li>In the treatment of selected cases of breast cancer in men and women.</li>
<li>In the treatment of cancer of the prostate in men.</li>
</ul><p>Estrogens may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.</p><p>There is <i>no</i> medical evidence to support the belief that the use of estrogens will keep the patient feeling young, keep the skin soft, or delay the appearance of wrinkles. Nor has it been proven that the use of estrogens during menopause will relieve emotional and nervous symptoms, unless these symptoms are caused by other menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes or hot flushes.</p><p>Estrogens are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Vivelle-Dot</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Use of this medicine before puberty is not recommended. Growth of bones can be stopped early. Girls and boys may develop growth of breasts. Girls may have vaginal changes, including vaginal bleeding.</p><p>This medicine may be used to start puberty in teenagers with some types of delayed puberty.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Elderly people are especially sensitive to the effects of estrogens. This may increase the chance of side effects during treatment, especially stroke, invasive breast cancer, and memory problems.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Estrogens are not recommended for use during pregnancy or right after giving birth. Becoming pregnant or maintaining a pregnancy is not likely to occur around the time of menopause.</p><p>Certain estrogens have been shown to cause serious birth defects in humans and animals. Some daughters of women who took diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy have developed reproductive (genital) tract problems and, rarely, cancer of the vagina or cervix (opening to the uterus) when they reached childbearing age. Some sons of women who took DES during pregnancy have developed urinary-genital tract problems.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Use of this medicine is not recommended in nursing mothers. Estrogens pass into the breast milk and their possible effect on the baby is not known.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with a medication in this class or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><p><i>For all patients</i></p><ul>
<li>Asthma or</li>
<li>Calcium, too much or too little in blood or</li>
<li>Diabetes or</li>
<li>Epilepsy or seizures or</li>
<li>Heart problems or</li>
<li>Kidney problems or</li>
<li>Liver tumors, benign or</li>
<li>Lupus erythematosus, systemic or</li>
<li>Migraine headaches—Estrogens may worsen these conditions.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Blood clotting problems, or history of during previous estrogen therapy—Estrogens usually are not used until blood clotting problems stop; using estrogens is not a problem for most patients without a history of blood clotting problems due to estrogen use.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Breast cancer or</li>
<li>Bone cancer or</li>
<li>Cancer of the uterus or</li>
<li>Fibroid tumors of the uterus—Estrogens may interfere with the treatment of breast or bone cancer or worsen cancer of the uterus when these conditions are present.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Bulging eyes or</li>
<li>Double vision or</li>
<li>Migraine headache or</li>
<li>Vision changes, sudden onset including or</li>
<li>Vision loss, partial or complete—Estrogens may cause these problems. Tell your doctor if you have had any of these problems, especially while taking estrogen or oral contraceptives (“birth control pills”).</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Changes in genital or vaginal bleeding of unknown causes—Use of estrogens may delay diagnosis or worsen condition. The reason for the bleeding should be determined before estrogens are used.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Endometriosis or</li>
<li>Gallbladder disease or gallstones, or history of or</li>
<li>High cholesterol or triglycerides, or history of or</li>
<li>Liver disease, or history of or</li>
<li>Pancreatitis (inflammation of pancreas) or</li>
<li>Porphyria—Estrogens may worsen these conditions. Although estrogens can improve blood cholesterol, they can worsen blood triglycerides for some people.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Hypothyroid (too little thyroid hormone)—Dose of thyroid medicine may need to be increased.</li>
</ul><p><i>For males treated for breast or prostate cancer</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Blood clots or</li>
<li>Heart or circulation disease or</li>
<li>Stroke—Males with these medical problems may be more likely to have clotting problems while taking estrogens; the high doses of estrogens used to treat male breast or prostate cancer have been shown to increase the chances of heart attack, phlebitis (inflamed veins) caused by a blood clot, or blood clots in the lungs.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Vivelle-Dot</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain estrogen.  It may not be specific to Vivelle-Dot. Please read with care.</b></p><p><i>Take this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it and do not take or use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered</i>. For patients taking any of the estrogens by mouth, try to take the medicine at the same time each day to reduce the possibility of side effects and to allow it to work better.</p><p>This medicine usually comes with patient information or directions. Read and follow the instructions in the insert carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>For patients taking any of the estrogens <i>by mouth or by injection</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Nausea may occur during the first few weeks after you start taking estrogens. This effect usually disappears with continued use. If the nausea is bothersome, it can usually be prevented or reduced by taking each dose with food or immediately after food.</li>
</ul><p>For patients using the <i>transdermal (skin patch)</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Wash and dry your hands thoroughly before and after handling the patch.</li>
<li>Apply the patch to a clean, dry, non-oily skin area of your lower abdomen, hips below the waist, or buttocks that has little or no hair and is free of cuts or irritation. The manufacturer of the 0.025-mg patch recommends that its patch be applied to the buttocks only. Furthermore, each new patch should be applied to a new site of application. For instance, if the old patch is taken off the left buttock, then apply the new patch to the right buttock.</li>
<li>Do not apply to the breasts. Also, do not apply to the waistline or anywhere else where tight clothes may rub the patch loose.</li>
<li>Press the patch firmly in place with the palm of your hand for about 10 seconds. Make sure there is good contact, especially around the edges.</li>
<li>If a patch becomes loose or falls off, you may reapply it or discard it and apply a new patch.</li>
<li>Each dose is best applied to a different area of skin on your lower abdomen, hips below the waist, or buttocks so that at least 1 week goes by before the same area is used again. This will help prevent skin irritation.</li>
</ul><p>For patients using the <i>topical emulsion (skin lotion)</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Washing and drying hands thoroughly before each application.</li>
<li>Apply while you are sitting comfortably. Apply one pouch to each leg every morning.</li>
<li>Apply the entire contents of one pouch to clean, dry skin on the left thigh. Rub the emulsion into the entire thigh and calf for 3 minutes until thoroughly absorbed.</li>
<li>Apply entire contents of the second pouch to clean, dry skin on the right thigh. Rub the emulsion into the entire thigh and calf for 3 minutes until thoroughly absorbed.</li>
<li>Rub any remaining emulsion on both hands on the buttocks.</li>
<li>Washing and drying hands thoroughly after application.</li>
<li>To avoid transfer to other individuals, allow the application areas to dry completely before covering with clothing.</li>
</ul><p>If you are using the <i>Evamist® transdermal spray</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Spray the medicine on your skin on the inside of your forearm, between the elbow and the wrist.</li>
<li>Do not allow your child to touch the area of the arm where the medicine was sprayed. If you cannot avoid to come nearer with your child, wear clothes with long sleeves to cover the application site.</li>
<li>If your child comes in direct contact with the arm where the medicine was sprayed, wash your child's skin right away with soap and water.</li>
<li>Do not allow your pets to lick or touch the arm where the medicine was sprayed.</li>

Keep from freezing.</p><p>Keep out of the reach of children.</p><p>Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.</p><p>Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using Vivelle-Dot</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine does not cause unwanted effects</i>. These visits will usually be every year, but some doctors require them more often.</p><p>In some patients using estrogens, tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of the gums may occur. Brushing and flossing your teeth carefully and regularly and massaging your gums may help prevent this. See your dentist regularly to have your teeth cleaned. Check with your medical doctor or dentist if you have any questions about how to take care of your teeth and gums, or if you notice any tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of your gums.</p><p><i>Although the incidence is low, the use of estrogens may increase you chance of getting cancer of the breast, ovaries, or uterus (womb)</i>. <i>Therefore, it is very important that you regularly check your breasts for any unusual lumps or discharge. Report any problems to your doctor</i>. You should also have a mammogram (x-ray pictures of the breasts) done if your doctor recommends it. Because breast cancer has occurred in men taking estrogens, regular breast self-exams and exams by your doctor for any unusual lumps or discharge should be done.</p><p><i>If your menstrual periods have stopped, they may start again</i>. This effect will continue for as long as the medicine is taken. However, if taking the continuous treatment (0.625 mg conjugated estrogens and 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone once a day), monthly bleeding usually stops within 10 months.</p><p>Also, vaginal bleeding between your regular menstrual periods may occur during the first 3 months of use. Do not stop taking your medicine. <i>Check with your doctor if bleeding continues for an unusually long time, if your period has not started within 45 days of your last period, or if you think you are pregnant</i>.</p><p>Tell the doctor in charge that you are using this medicine before having any laboratory test because some results may be affected.</p><p>Check with your child's doctor right away if your child starts to have the following symptoms: nipple or breast swelling or tenderness in females, or enlargement of the breasts in males. Your child may have been exposed to <i>Evamist® transdermal spray</i>.</p><p>Do not allow your pets to lick or touch the arm where <i>Evamist® transdermal spray</i> was applied. Small pets may be sensitive to this medicine. Call your pet's veterinarian if your pet starts to have the following symptoms: nipple or breast enlargement, swelling of the vulva, or any signs of illness.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Vivelle-Dot side effects</h2><p>Women rarely have severe side effects from taking estrogens to replace estrogen. Discuss these possible effects with your doctor:</p><p>The prolonged use of estrogens has been reported to increase the risk of endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus) in women after menopause. This risk seems to increase as the dose and the length of use increase. When estrogens are used in low doses for less than 1 year, there is less risk. The risk is also reduced if a progestin (another female hormone) is added to, or replaces part of, your estrogen dose. If the uterus has been removed by surgery (total hysterectomy), there is no risk of endometrial cancer.</p><p>Although the incidence is low, the use of estrogens may increase you chance of getting cancer of the breast. Breast cancer has been reported in men taking estrogens.</p><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>The following side effects may be caused by blood clots, which could lead to stroke, heart attack, or death. These side effects occur rarely, and, when they do occur, they occur in men treated for cancer using high doses of estrogens.</p><p><i>Check with your doctor immediately</i> if any of the following side effects occur:</p><p><i>More common</i></p><ul>
