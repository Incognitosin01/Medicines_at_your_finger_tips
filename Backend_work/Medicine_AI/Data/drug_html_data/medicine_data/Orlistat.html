This medicine must be used together with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. Orlistat is for use only in adults that are overweight or obese.</p><p>Xenical is the prescription-strength form of orlistat. The Alli brand is available without a prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not take orlistat if you are pregnant.</b></p><p>You should not use this medicine if you have a digestive disorder (problems absorbing food).

Do not use <b>Alli</b> if you have had an organ transplant, if you use cyclosporine, or if you are not overweight.</p><p>Orlistat is only part of a complete program of treatment that also includes diet, exercise, and weight control. Your daily intake of fat, protein, and carbohydrates should be evenly divided over all of your daily meals. Follow your diet, medication, and exercise routines very closely.</p><p>Avoid a diet that is high in fat. High-fat meals taken in combination with orlistat can increase your risk of unpleasant side effects on your stomach or intestines.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use orlistat if you are allergic to it, if you have malabsorption syndrome (an inability to absorb food and nutrients properly), or if you are pregnant.</p><p>You also should not use Xenical if you have:</p><ul>
