It prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation.</p><p>Mometasone inhalation is used to prevent asthma attacks. It will not treat an asthma attack that has already begun.</p><p>Mometasone may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Mometasone inhalation is not a rescue medicine for asthma attacks.</b> Use only fast-acting inhalation medicine for an attack. Seek medical attention if your breathing problems get worse quickly, or if you think your asthma medications are not working as well.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use  mometasone inhalation if you are allergic to mometasone, or to milk proteins.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

It is not known whether this medicine will harm an unborn baby. However, having untreated or uncontrolled asthma during pregnancy may cause complications such as low birth weight, premature birth, or eclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure that can lead to medical problems in both mother and baby). The benefit of treating asthma may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><p>Do not give this medicine to a child younger than 4 years old. <b>Asmanex HFA</b> should not be given to a child younger than 5 years old.</p><p>Long-term use of steroids may lead to bone loss (osteoporosis), especially if you smoke, if you do not exercise, if you do not get enough vitamin D or calcium in your diet, or if you have a family history of osteoporosis. Talk with your doctor about your risk of osteoporosis.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use mometasone inhalation?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p><b>Mometasone inhalation is not a rescue medicine for asthma attacks.</b> Use only fast-acting inhalation medicine for an attack. Seek medical attention if your breathing problems get worse quickly, or if you think your asthma medications are not working as well.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Rinse your mouth with water without swallowing after each use of your inhaler.</p><p>Mometasone can weaken (suppress) your immune system, and you may get an infection more easily.</p><p>It may take up to 2 weeks before your symptoms improve. Keep using the medication as directed and call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve after 1 week of treatment.</p><p>If you also use an oral steroid medication, you should not stop using it suddenly. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.</p><p>Your dose needs may change if you have surgery, are ill, are under stress, or have recently had an asthma attack. If you had been taking an oral (taken by mouth) steroid, you may need to restart the oral medicine. Do not change your medication dose or schedule without your doctor's advice.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. When you first open the foil pouch and remove the inhaler device, write the date on the device. Throw away the inhaler when the dose counter shows "00."</p><p>Keep the cap on your inhaler when not in use. Keep the inhalation aerosol canister away from open flame or high heat. The canister may explode if it gets too hot. Do not puncture or burn an empty inhaler canister.</p><p>Do not wash your inhaler device or allow it to get wet. Wipe the mouthpiece with a clean dry tissue or cloth.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Use the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose.
