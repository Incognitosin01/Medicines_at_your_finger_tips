TOPICAL SPRAY<br/>
NDC: 69094-0229-04<br/>
ACTIVE INGREDIENTS:<br/>
Camphor 4%<br/>
Histamine 0.025%<br/>
Menthol 10%<br/>
INDICATIONS AND USAGE:<br/>
For temporary relief of minor aches and pains of the muscles and joints associated with simple backache, arthritis, strains, bruises and sprains.<br/>
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:<br/>
Histamine works through vasodilation. This is the process of expanding blood vessels to increase circulation, providing pain relief within the affected tissue.<br/>
Camphor is used topically to increase local blood flow and as a “counterirritant.” When applied externally, camphor numbs the nerve endings. The nerve endings then no longer transmit the sensation of pain.<br/>
Menthol instantly brings cool, soothing pain relief to aching muscles. Menthol also has a natural analgesic attribute when applied topically. It has molecules called ligands, which attach themselves to receptors (Kappa Opioid Receptors) in your cell, which produces a numbing effect. Using Menthol topically causes vasodilation, which increases blood flow to the affected area, allowing other medicinal ingredients found in the topical spray to work faster.<br/>
CONTRAINDICATIONS:<br/>
Tetramex is contraindicated in patients with known history of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics, Menthol, camphor, and to other components of Tetramex topical spray.<br/>
