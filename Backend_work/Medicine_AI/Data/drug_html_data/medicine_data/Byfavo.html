Continuously monitor vital signs during sedation and through the recovery period.Resuscitative drugs, and age-and size-appropriate equipment for bag/valve/mask assisted ventilation must be immediately available during administration of remimazolam.Concomitant use of benzodiazepines with opioid analgesics may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. The sedative effect of intravenous remimazolam can be accentuated by concomitantly administered CNS depressant medications, including other benzodiazepines and propofol.
