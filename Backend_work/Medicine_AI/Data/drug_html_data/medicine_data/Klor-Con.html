Potassium levels can be low as a result of a disease or from taking certain medicines, or after a prolonged illness with diarrhea or vomiting.</p><p>Klor-Con is available as effervescent tablets, extended release tablets, extended release capsules (sprinkle), and powder for oral solution.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Klor-Con if you have high levels of potassium in your blood (hyperkalemia), or if you also take a "potassium-sparing" diuretic.</p><p>To be sure Klor-Con is helping your condition, your blood may need to be tested often. Your heart rate and rhythm may also be checked using an electrocardiograph or ECG (sometimes called an EKG) to measure electrical activity of the heart. Do not miss any scheduled appointments.</p><p>Serious side effects of potassium include uneven heartbeat, muscle weakness or limp feeling, severe stomach pain, and numbness or tingling in your hands, feet, or mouth.</p><p>Do not stop taking Klor-Con without first talking to your doctor. If you stop taking potassium suddenly, your condition may become worse.</p><p>Do not crush, chew, break, or suck on an extended-release tablet or capsule. Swallow the pill whole. Breaking or crushing the pill may cause too much of the drug to be released at one time. Sucking on a potassium tablet can irritate your mouth or throat. Take Klor-Con with food or just after a meal.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Klor-Con if you are allergic to potassium chloride, or if:</p><ul>
