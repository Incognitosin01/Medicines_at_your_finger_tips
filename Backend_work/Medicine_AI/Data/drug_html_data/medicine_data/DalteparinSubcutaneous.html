<html><head></head><body><h1>Dalteparin (Subcutaneous)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> dalteparin (dal-te-PAR-in)</p><p>Patients anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparins or heparinoids who receive neuraxial anesthesia or undergo a spinal puncture are at risk for epidural or spinal hematomas, which may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. The use of indwelling epidural catheters, concomitant drugs that also affect hemostasis (eg, NSAIDs, platelet inhibitors, or other anticoagulants), history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures, or history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery further increase this risk. The optimal timing of dalteparin administration and a neuraxial procedure is unknown. Frequent monitoring for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment is recommended.

These blood clots can travel to the lungs and can become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing a condition called pulmonary embolism. Dalteparin is also used together with aspirin to prevent blood clots from forming in blood vessels of patients with unstable angina or heart attack. Dalteparin is also used for several days after abdominal surgery, hip replacement surgery, or while you are unable to walk. It is during this time that blood clots are most likely to form. Dalteparin is also used to treat symptomatic blood clots (eg, pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) in children and as extended treatment of symptomatic blood clots in adults with cancer.</p><p>Dalteparin is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using dalteparin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For dalteparin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to dalteparin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of dalteparin to treat symptomatic blood clots in children younger than 1 month of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of dalteparin in the elderly. However, elderly patients may require an adjustment in the dose, especially those who are at risk of bleeding or those who have kidney disease.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking dalteparin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using dalteparin with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>
<li>Defibrotide</li>
</ul><p>Using dalteparin with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of dalteparin</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you dalteparin. It is given as a shot under your skin (usually in the stomach, buttocks, or thighs). You or your caregiver may be trained to prepare and inject the medicine at home. Be sure that you understand how to use the medicine.</p><p>You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections.</p><p>If the medicine in the vial (glass container) or prefilled syringe has changed color, or if you see particles in it, do not use it.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of dalteparin will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of dalteparin. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects. Be sure to keep all appointments.</p><p>Dalteparin may increase your risk of bleeding or bruising. This risk is higher if you have poorly controlled high blood pressure, a heart infection, stomach ulcers, or other bleeding problems. Check with your doctor right away if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin. Avoid picking your nose. If you need to blow your nose, blow it gently.</p><p>Dalteparin may increase your risk of serious bleeding or nerve problems in your spine. This risk is higher if you have a catheter in your back for pain medicine or anesthetics, or have an injection into your spine (sometimes called an "epidural" or "spinal"). Other factors include traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures in the past, spinal deformity, previous spinal surgery, or use of other medications that increase the risk of bleeding. Check with your doctor right away if you develop weakness or numbness in your legs or feet, or loss of urine or bowel control.</p><p>Call your doctor right away if you start having pains in the chest, groin, or legs, especially the calves, difficulty with breathing, severe, sudden headache, slurred speech, sudden, sudden loss of coordination, sudden, severe weakness or numbness in the arm or leg, or vision changes. These may be symptoms of thromboembolism.</p><p>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</p><p>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects, such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters. Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</p><p>Dalteparin contains benzyl alcohol which may cause serious unwanted effects to newborn or premature infants. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this.</p><p>Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using dalteparin. You may need to stop using dalteparin several days before having surgery or medical tests.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Dalteparin side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
