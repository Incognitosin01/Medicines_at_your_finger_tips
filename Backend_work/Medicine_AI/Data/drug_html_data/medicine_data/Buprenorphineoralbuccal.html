Never use buprenorphine in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if you feel an increased urge to take more of  buprenorphine.</p><p><b>Never share opioid medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away opioid medicine is against the law.</p><p>Drink a glass of water to moisten your mouth. Use dry hands when handling the buccal film. Place the film against the inside of your cheek and hold it in place for 5 seconds. Once in place, the film will dissolve completely in about 30 minutes. Do not chew the film or swallow it whole.</p><p>Do not eat or drink anything until the film has completely dissolved in your mouth.</p><p>You may need frequent blood tests to check your liver function.</p><p>If you need surgery, tell the surgeon ahead of time that you are using buprenorphine.</p><p>Do not stop using buprenorphine suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using buprenorphine.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep the medicine in a place where a child cannot get to it. Keep track of your medicine. Buprenorphine is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Do not keep leftover opioid medication. <b>Just one dose can cause death in someone using this medicine accidentally or improperly.</b> Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, remove any unused films from the foil pack and flush the films down the toilet. Throw the empty foil pack into the trash.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since buprenorphine is used for pain, you are not likely to miss a dose. Skip any missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>A buprenorphine overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b></p><p>Overdose symptoms may include extreme drowsiness or weakness, cold or clammy skin, severe muscle weakness, pinpoint pupils, weak pulse, very slow breathing, or coma.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking buprenorphine buccal?</h2><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><p>Avoid applying the buccal film to an area where you have a mouth sore.</p><p>Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how  buprenorphine will affect you.
