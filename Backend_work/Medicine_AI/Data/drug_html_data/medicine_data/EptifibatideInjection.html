<li>Injection: 75 mg of Eptifibatide Injection in 100 mL (0.75 mg/mL), for intravenous infusion.</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Treatment with Eptifibatide Injection is contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul>
<li>A history of bleeding diathesis, or evidence of active abnormal bleeding within the previous 30 days</li>
<li>Severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;200 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;110 mm Hg) not adequately controlled on antihypertensive therapy</li>

<li>Dependency on renal dialysis</li>
<li>Hypersensitivity to Eptifibatide Injection or any component of the product (hypersensitivity reactions that occurred included anaphylaxis and urticaria).</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Bleeding</h3><p class="First">Bleeding is the most common complication encountered during Eptifibatide Injection therapy. Administration of Eptifibatide Injection is associated with an increase in major and minor bleeding, as classified by the criteria of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Study group (TIMI) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]</span> . Most major bleeding associated with Eptifibatide Injection has been at the arterial access site for cardiac catheterization or from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. Minimize the use of arterial and venous punctures, intramuscular injections, and the use of urinary catheters, nasotracheal intubation, and nasogastric tubes. When obtaining intravenous access, avoid non-compressible sites (e.g., subclavian or jugular veins).</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Use of Thrombolytics, Anticoagulants, and Other Antiplatelet Agents</span></span></p><p>Risk factors for bleeding include older age, a history of bleeding disorders, and concomitant use of drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (thrombolytics, oral anticoagulants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and P2Y <span class="Sub">12</span> inhibitors). Concomitant treatment with other inhibitors of platelet receptor glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa should be avoided. In patients treated with heparin, bleeding can be minimized by close monitoring of the aPTT and ACT <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2)]</span> .</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Care of the Femoral Artery Access Site in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)</span></span></p><p>In patients undergoing PCI, treatment with Eptifibatide Injection is associated with an increase in major and minor bleeding at the site of arterial sheath placement. After PCI, eptifibatide infusion should be continued until hospital discharge or up to 18 to 24 hours, whichever comes first. Heparin use is discouraged after the PCI procedure. Early sheath removal is encouraged while Eptifibatide Injection is being infused. Prior to removing the sheath, it is recommended that heparin be discontinued for 3 to 4 hours and an aPTT of &lt;45 seconds or ACT &lt;150 seconds be achieved. In any case, both heparin and Eptifibatide Injection should be discontinued and sheath hemostasis should be achieved at least 2 to 4 hours before hospital discharge. If bleeding at access site cannot be controlled with pressure, infusion of Eptifibatide Injection and heparin should be discontinued immediately.</p><h3>Thrombocytopenia</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of acute, profound thrombocytopenia (immune-mediated and non-immune mediated) with Eptifibatide Injection. In the event of acute profound thrombocytopenia or a confirmed platelet decrease to &lt;100,000/mm <span class="Sup">3</span>, discontinue Eptifibatide Injection and heparin (unfractionated or low-molecular weight). Monitor serial platelet counts, assess the presence of drug-dependent antibodies, and treat as appropriate <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]</span> .</p><p>There has been no clinical experience with Eptifibatide Injection initiated in patients with a baseline platelet count &lt;100,000/mm <span class="Sup">3</span>. If a patient with low platelet counts is receiving Eptifibatide Injection, their platelet count should be monitored closely.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reaction is also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul>
<li>Bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications ( 4) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>A total of 16,782 patients were treated in the Phase III clinical trials (PURSUIT, ESPRIT, and IMPACT II) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Trials ( 14)]</span> . These 16,782 patients had a mean age of 62 years (range: 20-94 years). Eighty-nine percent of the patients were Caucasian, with the remainder being predominantly Black (5%) and Hispanic (5%). Sixty-eight percent were men. Because of the different regimens used in PURSUIT, IMPACT II, and ESPRIT, data from the 3 studies were not pooled.</p><p>Bleeding and hypotension were the most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and greater than placebo) in the Eptifibatide Injection controlled clinical trial database.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Bleeding</span></span></p><p>The incidence of bleeding and transfusions in the PURSUIT and ESPRIT studies are shown in Table 2. Bleeding was classified as major or minor by the criteria of the TIMI study group. Major bleeding consisted of intracranial hemorrhage and other bleeding that led to decreases in hemoglobin greater than 5 g/dL. Minor bleeding included spontaneous gross hematuria, spontaneous hematemesis, other observed blood loss with a hemoglobin decrease of more than 3 g/dL, and other hemoglobin decreases that were greater than 4 g/dL but less than 5 g/dL. In patients who received transfusions, the corresponding loss in hemoglobin was estimated through an adaptation of the method of Landefeld et al.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PURSUIT (ACS)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Eptifibatide</span><span class="Bold">Injection</span></p><p><span class="Bold">180/2</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n (%)</span></p><p class="First">Patients</p><p class="First">4696</p><p class="First">4679</p><p class="First">Major bleeding*</p><p class="First">425 (9.3%)</p><p class="First">498 (10.8%)</p><p class="First">Minor bleeding*</p><p class="First">347 (7.6%)</p><p class="First">604 (13.1%)</p><p class="First">Requiring transfusions†</p><p class="First">490 (10.4%)</p><p class="First">601 (12.8%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ESPRIT (PCI)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Eptifibatide</span><span class="Bold">Injection</span></p><p><span class="Bold">180/2/180</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n (%)</span></p><p class="First">Patients</p><p class="First">1024</p><p class="First">1040</p><p class="First">Major bleeding*</p><p class="First">4 (0.4%)</p><p class="First">13 (1.3%)</p><p class="First">Minor bleeding*</p><p class="First">18 (2%)</p><p class="First">29 (3%)</p><p class="First">Requiring transfusions†</p><p class="First">11 (1.1%)</p><p class="First">16 (1.5%)</p><p>The majority of major bleeding reactions in the ESPRIT study occurred at the vascular access site (1 and 8 patients, or 0.1% and 0.8% in the placebo and Eptifibatide Injection groups, respectively). Bleeding at “other” locations occurred in 0.2% and 0.4% of patients, respectively.</p><p>In the PURSUIT study, the greatest increase in major bleeding in eptifibatide-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients was also associated with bleeding at the femoral artery access site (2.8% versus 1.3%). Oropharyngeal (primarily gingival), genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and retroperitoneal bleeding were also seen more commonly in eptifibatide-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients.</p><p>Among patients experiencing a major bleed in the IMPACT II study, an increase in bleeding on Eptifibatide Injection versus placebo was observed only for the femoral artery access site (3.2% versus 2.8%).</p><p>Table 3 displays the incidence of TIMI major bleeding according to the cardiac procedures carried out in the PURSUIT study.

In the PURSUIT study, 3 patients in the placebo group, 1 patient in the group treated with Eptifibatide Injection 180/1.3, and 5 patients in the group treated with Eptifibatide Injection 180/2 experienced a hemorrhagic stroke. The overall incidence of stroke was 0.5% in patients receiving eptifibatide 180/1.3, 0.7% in patients receiving Eptifibatide Injection 180/2, and 0.8% in placebo patients.</p><p>In the IMPACT II study, intracranial hemorrhage was experienced by 1 patient treated with Eptifibatide Injection 135/0.5, 2 patients treated with Eptifibatide Injection 135/0.75, and 2 patients in the placebo group. The overall incidence of stroke was 0.5% in patients receiving 135/0.5 Eptifibatide Injection, 0.7% in patients receiving Eptifibatide Injection 135/0.75, and 0.7% in the placebo group.</p><p>In the ESPRIT study, there were 3 hemorrhagic strokes, 1 in the placebo group and 2 in the Eptifibatide Injection group. In addition there was 1 case of cerebral infarction in the Eptifibatide Injection group.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Immunogenicity/Thrombocytopenia</span></span></p><p>The potential for development of antibodies to eptifibatide has been studied in 433 subjects. Eptifibatide Injection was nonantigenic in 412 patients receiving a single administration of Eptifibatide Injection (135 mcg/kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of either 0.5 mcg/kg/min or 0.75 mcg/kg/min), and in 21 subjects to whom Eptifibatide Injection (135 mcg/kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 0.75 mcg/kg/min) was administered twice, 28 days apart. In both cases, plasma for antibody detection was collected approximately 30 days after each dose. The development of antibodies to eptifibatide at higher doses has not been evaluated.</p><p>In patients with suspected eptifibatide-related immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, IgG antibodies that react with the GP IIb/IIIa complex were identified in the presence of eptifibatide and in eptifibatide-naïve patients. These findings suggest acute thrombocytopenia after the administration of Eptifibatide Injection can develop as a result of naturally occurring drug-dependent antibodies or those induced by prior exposure to Eptifibatide Injection. Similar antibodies were identified with other GP IIb/IIIa ligand-mimetic agents. Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia with Eptifibatide Injection may be associated with hypotension and/or other signs of hypersensitivity.</p><p>In the PURSUIT and IMPACT II studies, the incidence of thrombocytopenia (&lt;100,000/mm <span class="Sup">3</span> or ≥50% reduction from baseline) and the incidence of platelet transfusions were similar between patients treated with Eptifibatide Injection and placebo.

In PURSUIT, the only serious nonbleeding adverse reaction that occurred at a rate of at least 1% and was more common with Eptifibatide Injection than placebo (7% versus 6%) was hypotension. Most of the serious nonbleeding adverse reactions consisted of cardiovascular reactions typical of a UA population. In the IMPACT II study, serious nonbleeding adverse reactions that occurred in greater than 1% of patients were uncommon and similar in incidence between placebo- and eptifibatide-treated patients.</p><p>Discontinuation of study drug due to adverse reactions other than bleeding was uncommon in the PURSUIT, IMPACT II, and ESPRIT studies, with no single reaction occurring in &gt;0.5% of the study population (except for “other” in the ESPRIT study).</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">Because the reactions below are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>The following adverse reactions have been reported in postmarketing experience, primarily with Eptifibatide Injection in combination with heparin and aspirin: cerebral, GI, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Fatal bleeding reactions have been reported. Acute profound thrombocytopenia, as well as immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, has been reported <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]</span> .</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Use of Thrombolytics, Anticoagulants, and Other Antiplatelet Agents</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of antiplatelet agents, thrombolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding. Concomitant treatment with other inhibitors of platelet receptor GP IIb/IIIa should be avoided.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category B</span></p><p>Teratology studies have been performed by continuous intravenous infusion of eptifibatide in pregnant rats at total daily doses of up to 72 mg/kg/day (about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis) and in pregnant rabbits at total daily doses of up to 36 mg/kg/day (also about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis). These studies revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to eptifibatide. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with Eptifibatide Injection. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Eptifibatide Injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether eptifibatide is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Eptifibatide Injection is administered to a nursing mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Eptifibatide Injection in pediatric patients have not been studied.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The PURSUIT and IMPACT II clinical studies enrolled patients up to the age of 94 years (45% were age 65 and over; 12% were age 75 and older). There was no apparent difference in efficacy between older and younger patients treated with Eptifibatide Injection. The incidence of bleeding complications was higher in the elderly in both placebo and Eptifibatide Injection groups, and the incremental risk of eptifibatide-associated bleeding was greater in the older patients. No dose adjustment was made for elderly patients, but patients over 75 years of age had to weigh at least 50 kg to be enrolled in the PURSUIT study; no such limitation was stipulated in the ESPRIT study <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]</span> .</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Approximately 50% of eptifibatide is cleared by the kidney in patients with normal renal function. Total drug clearance is decreased by approximately 50% and steady-state plasma Eptifibatide Injection concentrations are doubled in patients with an estimated CrCl &lt;50 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault equation). Therefore, the infusion dose should be reduced to 1 mcg/kg/min in such patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2)]</span> . The safety and efficacy of Eptifibatide Injection in patients dependent on dialysis has not been established.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There has been only limited experience with overdosage of Eptifibatide Injection. There were 8 patients in the IMPACT II study, 9 patients in the PURSUIT study, and no patients in the ESPRIT study who received bolus doses and/or infusion doses more than double those called for in the protocols. None of these patients experienced an intracranial bleed or other major bleeding.</p><p>Eptifibatide was not lethal to rats, rabbits, or monkeys when administered by continuous intravenous infusion for 90 minutes at a total dose of 45 mg/kg (about 2 to 5 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis). Symptoms of acute toxicity were loss of righting reflex, dyspnea, ptosis, and decreased muscle tone in rabbits and petechial hemorrhages in the femoral and abdominal areas of monkeys.</p><p>From <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies, eptifibatide is not extensively bound to plasma proteins and thus may be cleared from plasma by dialysis.</p><h2>Eptifibatide Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Eptifibatide is a cyclic heptapeptide containing 6 amino acids and 1 mercaptopropionyl (des-amino cysteinyl) residue. An interchain disulfide bridge is formed between the cysteine amide and the mercaptopropionyl moieties. Chemically it is N <span class="Sup">6</span>-(aminoiminomethyl)-N <span class="Sup">2</span>-(3-mercapto-1-oxopropyl)-L-lysylglycyl-L-α-aspartyl-L-tryptophyl-L-prolyl-L-cysteinamide, cyclic (1→6)-disulfide. Eptifibatide binds to the platelet receptor glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa of human platelets and inhibits platelet aggregation.</p><p>The eptifibatide peptide is produced by solution-phase peptide synthesis, and is purified by preparative reverse-phase liquid chromatography and lyophilized. The structural formula is:</p><p>Eptifibatide Injection is a clear, colorless, sterile, non-pyrogenic solution for intravenous (IV) use with an empirical formula of C <span class="Sub">35</span>H <span class="Sub">49</span>N <span class="Sub">11</span>O <span class="Sub">9</span>S <span class="Sub">2</span> and a molecular weight of 831.96. Each 10 mL vial contains 2 mg/mL of Eptifibatide Injection and each 100 mL vial contains 0.75 mg/mL of Eptifibatide Injection. Each vial of either size also contains 5.25 mg/mL citric acid and sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH to 5.35.</p><h2>Eptifibatide Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Eptifibatide reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesive ligands to GP IIb/IIIa. When administered intravenously, eptifibatide inhibits <span class="Italics">ex vivo</span> platelet aggregation in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. Platelet aggregation inhibition is reversible following cessation of the eptifibatide infusion; this is thought to result from dissociation of eptifibatide from the platelet.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Infusion of eptifibatide into baboons caused a dose-dependent inhibition of <span class="Italics">ex vivo</span> platelet aggregation, with complete inhibition of aggregation achieved at infusion rates greater than 5 mcg/kg/min. In a baboon model that is refractory to aspirin and heparin, doses of eptifibatide that inhibit aggregation prevented acute thrombosis with only a modest prolongation (2- to 3-fold) of the bleeding time. Platelet aggregation in dogs was also inhibited by infusions of eptifibatide, with complete inhibition at 2 mcg/kg/min. This infusion dose completely inhibited canine coronary thrombosis induced by coronary artery injury (Folts model).</p><p>Human pharmacodynamic data were obtained in healthy subjects and in patients presenting with UA or NSTEMI and/or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Studies in healthy subjects enrolled only males; patient studies enrolled approximately one-third women. In these studies, Eptifibatide Injection inhibited <span class="Italics">ex vivo</span> platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and other agonists in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. The effect of Eptifibatide Injection was observed immediately after administration of a 180 mcg/kg intravenous bolus. Table 4 shows the effects of dosing regimens of Eptifibatide Injection used in the IMPACT II and PURSUIT studies on <span class="Italics">ex vivo</span> platelet aggregation induced by 20 µM ADP in PPACK-anticoagulated platelet-rich plasma and on bleeding time. The effects of the dosing regimen used in ESPRIT on platelet aggregation have not been studied.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PURSUIT</span></p><p><span class="Bold">180/2*</span></p><p class="First">Inhibition of platelet aggregation 15 min after bolus</p><p class="First">84%</p><p class="First">Inhibition of platelet aggregation at steady state</p><p class="First">&gt;90%</p><p class="First">Bleeding-time prolongation at steady state</p><p class="First">&lt;5x</p><p class="First">Inhibition of platelet aggregation 4h after infusion discontinuation</p><p class="First">&lt;50%</p><p class="First">Bleeding-time prolongation 6h after infusion discontinuation</p><p class="First">1.4x</p><p>The Eptifibatide Injection dosing regimen used in the ESPRIT study included two 180 mcg/kg bolus doses given 10 minutes apart combined with a continuous 2 mcg/kg/min infusion.</p><p>When administered alone, Eptifibatide Injection has no measurable effect on PT or aPTT.</p><p>There were no important differences between men and women or between age groups in the pharmacodynamic properties of eptifibatide. Differences among ethnic groups have not been assessed.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide are linear and dose-proportional for bolus doses ranging from 90 to 250 mcg/kg and infusion rates from 0.5 to 3 mcg/kg/min. Plasma elimination half-life is approximately 2.5 hours. Administration of a single 180 mcg/kg bolus combined with an infusion produces an early peak level, followed by a small decline prior to attaining steady state (within 4-6 hours). This decline can be prevented by administering a second 180 mcg/kg bolus 10 minutes after the first. The extent of eptifibatide binding to human plasma protein is about 25%. Clearance in patients with coronary artery disease is about 55 mL/kg/h. In healthy subjects, renal clearance accounts for approximately 50% of total body clearance, with the majority of the drug excreted in the urine as eptifibatide, deaminated eptifibatide, and other, more polar metabolites. No major metabolites have been detected in human plasma.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Special Populations</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Geriatric</span></span></p><p>Patients in clinical studies were older (range: 20-94 years) than those in the clinical pharmacology studies. Elderly patients with coronary artery disease demonstrated higher plasma levels and lower total body clearance of eptifibatide when given the same dose as younger patients. Limited data are available on lighter weight (&lt;50 kg) patients over 75 years of age.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span></span></p><p>In patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (CrCl &lt;50 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation), the clearance of eptifibatide is reduced by approximately 50% and steady-state plasma levels approximately doubled <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6) and Dosage and Administration ( 2)]</span> .</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Hepatic Impairment</span></span></p><p>No studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Gender</span></span></p><p>Males and females have not demonstrated any clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of eptifibatide. Eptifibatide was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (L 5178Y, TK+/-) forward mutation test, the human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, or the mouse micronucleus test. Administered by continuous intravenous infusion at total daily doses up to 72 mg/kg/day (about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis), eptifibatide had no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Eptifibatide Injection was studied in 3 placebo-controlled, randomized studies. PURSUIT evaluated patients with acute coronary syndromes: UA or NSTEMI. Two other studies, ESPRIT and IMPACT II, evaluated patients about to undergo a PCI. Patients underwent primarily balloon angioplasty in IMPACT II and intracoronary stent placement, with or without angioplasty, in ESPRIT.</p><h3>Non-ST-Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome is defined as prolonged (≥10 minutes) symptoms of cardiac ischemia within the previous 24 hours associated with either ST-segment changes (elevations between 0.6 mm and 1 mm or depression &gt;0.5 mm), T-wave inversion (&gt;1 mm), or positive CK-MB. This definition includes “unstable angina” and “NSTEMI” but excludes MI that is associated with Q waves or greater degrees of ST-segment elevation.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">PURSUIT (Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Eptifibatide Injection Therapy)</span></span></p><p>PURSUIT was a 726-center, 27-country, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 10,948 patients presenting with UA or NSTEMI. Patients could be enrolled only if they had experienced cardiac ischemia at rest (≥10 minutes) within the previous 24 hours and had either ST-segment changes (elevations between 0.6 mm and 1 mm or depression &gt;0.5 mm), T-wave inversion (&gt;1 mm), or increased CK-MB. Important exclusion criteria included a history of bleeding diathesis, evidence of abnormal bleeding within the previous 30 days, uncontrolled hypertension, major surgery within the previous 6 weeks, stroke within the previous 30 days, any history of hemorrhagic stroke, serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL, dependency on renal dialysis, or platelet count &lt;100,000/mm <span class="Sup">3</span>.</p><p>Patients were randomized to placebo, to Eptifibatide Injection 180 mcg/kg bolus followed by a 2 mcg/kg/min infusion (180/2), or to Eptifibatide Injection 180 mcg/kg bolus followed by a 1.3 mcg/kg/min infusion (180/1.3). The infusion was continued for 72 hours, until hospital discharge, or until the time of CABG, whichever occurred first, except that if PCI was performed, the eptifibatide infusion was continued for 24 hours after the procedure, allowing for a duration of infusion up to 96 hours.</p><p>The lower-infusion-rate arm was stopped after the first interim analysis when the 2 active-treatment arms appeared to have the same incidence of bleeding.</p><p>Patient age ranged from 20 to 94 (mean 63) years, and 65% were male. The patients were 89% Caucasian, 6% Hispanic, and 5% Black, recruited in the United States and Canada (40%), Western Europe (39%), Eastern Europe (16%), and Latin America (5%).</p><p>This was a “real world” study; each patient was managed according to the usual standards of the investigational site; frequencies of angiography, PCI, and CABG therefore differed widely from site to site and from country to country. Of the patients in PURSUIT, 13% were managed with PCI during drug infusion, of whom 50% received intracoronary stents; 87% were managed medically (without PCI during drug infusion).</p><p>The majority of patients received aspirin (75-325 mg once daily). Heparin was administered intravenously or subcutaneously, at the physician's discretion, most commonly as an intravenous bolus of 5000 units followed by a continuous infusion of 1000 units/h. For patients weighing less than 70 kg, the recommended heparin bolus dose was 60 units/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 12 units/kg/h. A target aPTT of 50 to 70 seconds was recommended. A total of 1250 patients underwent PCI within 72 hours after randomization, in which case they received intravenous heparin to maintain an ACT of 300 to 350 seconds.</p><p>The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of death from any cause or new MI (evaluated by a blinded Clinical Endpoints Committee) within 30 days of randomization.</p><p>Compared to placebo, Eptifibatide Injection administered as a 180 mcg/kg bolus followed by a 2 mcg/kg/min infusion significantly (p=0.042) reduced the incidence of endpoint events (see Table 6). The reduction in the incidence of endpoint events in patients receiving Eptifibatide Injection was evident early during treatment, and this reduction was maintained through at least 30 days (see Figure 1).
