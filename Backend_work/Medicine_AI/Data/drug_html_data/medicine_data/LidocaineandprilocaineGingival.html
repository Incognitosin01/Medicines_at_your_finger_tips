Lidocaine and prilocaine contains a mixture of two topical local anesthetics (numbing medicines). It deadens the nerve endings in the gum.</p><p>Lidocaine and prilocaine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your dentist.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using lidocaine and prilocaine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For lidocaine and prilocaine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to lidocaine and prilocaine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.
