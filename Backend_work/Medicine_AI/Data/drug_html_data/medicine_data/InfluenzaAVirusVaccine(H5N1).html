Invert each vial to mix; do not use if particulate matter or discoloration are present. Withdraw contents of adjuvant vial and add to the H5N1 antigen vial. Mix thoroughly by inversion and label with the time and date of mixing on vial. Use within 24 hours of mixing.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>For IM administration only. Gently shake prior to use. Inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Administer into the deltoid muscle; do not inject into the gluteal region or areas where there may be a major nerve trunk. Do not mix with other vaccines or injections; separate needles and syringes should be used for each injection (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). To prevent syncope-related injuries, patients should be vaccinated while seated or lying down (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). US law requires that the date of administration, the vaccine manufacturer, lot number of vaccine, and the administering person's name, title, and address be entered into the patient's permanent medical record.</p><p>GlaxoSmithKline product (AS03-adjuvanted): If vaccine is stored under refrigeration after mixing, bring to room temperature prior to administration (minimum 15 minutes). Mix thoroughly by inversion prior to administration.</p><p>Seqirus product (MF59-adjuvanted [Audenz]): Gently shake prior to administration; appearance should be milky white.</p><p>For patients at risk of hemorrhage following IM injection, the vaccine should be administered IM if, in the opinion of the physician familiar with the patient's bleeding risk, the vaccine can be administered by this route with reasonable safety. If the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered. A fine needle (23 gauge or smaller) can be used for the vaccination and firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. The patient should be instructed concerning the risk of hematoma from the injection. Patients on anticoagulant therapy should be considered to have the same bleeding risks and treated as those with clotting factor disorders (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Audenz and Sanofi Pasteur products: Store in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).

Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may be accompanied by transient visual disturbances, weakness, or tonic-clonic movements. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever); vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia); bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; if the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM injection can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Guillain-Barré syndrome: Use with caution in patients with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS); patients with history of GBS have a greater likelihood of developing GBS than those without. Although data specific to the influenza A virus vaccine (H5N1) are unavailable, the following guidance is based on seasonal influenza vaccines: As a precaution, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that patients with a history of GBS and who are at low risk for severe influenza complications and patients known to have experienced GBS within 6 weeks following previous vaccination should generally not be vaccinated (consider influenza antiviral chemoprophylaxis in these patients). The benefits of vaccination may outweigh the potential risks in persons with a history of GBS who are also at high risk for complications of influenza (CDC/ACIP [Grohskopf 2019]). Studies of patients who received the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine or the monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine have shown the risk of GBS is lower with vaccination than with influenza infection (Baxter 2013; Greene 2013; Kwong 2013).</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Anticoagulant therapy: Use with caution in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy; bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist. The ACIP prefers each dose of a specific vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer when possible; however vaccination should not be deferred because a specific brand name is unavailable (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Consider deferring immunization during periods of severe immunosuppression (eg, patients receiving chemo/radiation therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy [including high-dose corticosteroids]); may have a reduced response to vaccination. In general, household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive all age appropriate vaccines. Inactivated vaccines should be administered ≥2 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression when feasible; inactivated vaccines administered during chemotherapy should be readministered after immune competence is regained (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; IDSA [Rubin, 2014]).</p><p>• Elderly: Sanofi Pasteur product has not been evaluated in patients ≥65 years of age</p><p>• Pediatric: Apnea has occurred following intramuscular vaccine administration in premature infants; consider clinical status implications. In general, preterm infants should be vaccinated at the same chronological age as full-term infants (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Chicken egg protein: Product may be manufactured with chicken egg protein.</p><p>• Thimerosal: Product may contain thimerosal; hypersensitivity reactions may occur.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Antipyretics: Antipyretics have not been shown to prevent febrile seizures; antipyretics may be used to treat fever or discomfort following vaccination (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). One study reported that routine prophylactic administration of acetaminophen prior to vaccination to prevent fever decreased the immune response of some vaccines; the clinical significance of this reduction in immune response has not been established (Prymula 2009).</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor for anaphylaxis and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
