</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Biifenac 1000</h2><p class="First">Diclofenac sodium is indicated for the treatment of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee(s) (1).</p><h2>Biifenac 1000 Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Dosing Instructions</h3><p class="First">Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals <span class="Italics">[see WARNING AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)]</span></p><p>For the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee(s), the recommended dose is 40 drops per knee, 4 times a day.</p><p>Apply diclofenac sodium topical solution to clean, dry skin.</p><p>To avoid spillage, dispense diclofenac sodium topical solution 10 drops at a time either directly onto the knee or first into the hand and then onto the knee. Spread diclofenac sodium topical solution evenly around front, back and sides of the knee. Repeat this procedure until 40 drops have been applied and the knee is completely covered with solution.</p><p>To treat the other knee, if symptomatic, repeat the procedure.</p><p>Application of diclofenac sodium topical solution in an amount exceeding or less than the recommended dose has not been studied and is therefore not recommended.</p><h3>Special Precautions</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Avoid showering/bathing for at least 30 minutes after the application of diclofenac sodium topical solution to the treated knee.</li>
<li>Wash and dry hands after use.</li>
<li>Do not apply diclofenac sodium topical solution to open wounds.</li>
<li>Avoid contact of diclofenac sodium topical solution with eyes and mucous membranes.</li>
<li>Do not apply external heat and/or occlusive dressings to treated knees.</li>
<li>Avoid wearing clothing over the diclofenac sodium topical solution-treated knee(s) until the treated knee is dry.</li>
<li>Protect the treated knee(s) from natural or artificial sunlight</li>
<li>Wait until the treated area is dry before applying sunscreen, insect repellant, lotion, moisturizer, cosmetics, or other topical medication to the same knee you have just treated with diclofenac sodium topical solution</li>
</ul><p class="First">Until the treated knee(s) is completely dry, avoid skin-to-skin contact between other people and the treated knee(s).</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Do not use combination therapy with diclofenac sodium topical solution and an oral NSAID unless the benefit outweighs the risk and conduct periodic laboratory evaluations.</li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Diclofenac Sodium Topical Solution: 1.5% w/w</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Diclofenac sodium is contraindicated in the following patients:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions) to diclofenac or any components of the drug product. <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7,5.9)].</span></li>
<li>History of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, sometimes fatal, anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7,5.8)].</span></li>
<li>In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</span></p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NASAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p><p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</span></p><p>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Post-MI Patients</span></p><p>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</p><p>Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</span></p><p>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated Patients</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.</li>
<li>Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.</li>
<li>Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.</li>
<li>Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.</li>
<li>If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.</li>
<li>In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding <span class="Italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].</span></li>
</ul><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials, of oral diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of AST (SGOT) were observed in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies).</p><p>In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of 3,700 patients and included marke delevations (greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations.</p><p>In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.</p><p>In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days.</p><p>Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</p><p>If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver-related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen, antibiotics, antiepileptics).</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium, can lead to new onset of hypertension, or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs <span class="Italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].</span></p><p>Monitor blood pressure (BP) closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><h3>Heart Failure and Edema</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</span></p><p>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) <span class="Italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].</span></p><p>Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Renal Toxicity</span></p><p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.</p><p>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy was usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.</p><p>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium <span class="Italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].</span> Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to diclofenac and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)].</span></p><p>Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].</span> When diclofenac sodium is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].</span></p><p>Do not apply diclofenac sodium topical solution to open skin wounds, infections, inflammations, or exfoliative dermatitis, as it may affect absorption and tolerability of the drug.</p><h3>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) <span class="Italics">[see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.</p><p>NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders, concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding <span class="Italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].</span></p><p>The effects of diclofenac sodium on platelet function were studied in 10 healthy subjects administered 80 drops four times a day for 7 days. There was no significant change in platelet aggregation following one week of treatment <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12)].</span></p><h3>Masking of Inflammation and Fever</h3><p class="First">The pharmacological activity of diclofenac sodium in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><h3>Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)].</span></p><h3>Sun Exposure</h3><p class="First">Instruct patients to avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight on treated knee(s) because studies in animals indicated topical diclofenac treatment resulted in an earlier onset of ultraviolet light-induced skin tumors. The potential effects of diclofenac sodium on skin response to ultraviolet damage in humans are not known.</p><h3>Eye Exposure</h3><p class="First">Avoid contact of diclofenac sodium with eyes and mucosa. Advise patients that if eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and consult a physician if irritation persists for more than an hour.</p><h3>Oral Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of oral NSAIDs with diclofenac sodium resulted in a higher rate of rectal hemorrhage, more frequent abnormal creatinine, urea and hemoglobin. Therefore, do not use combination therapy with diclofenac sodium and an oral NSAID unless the benefit outweighs the risk and conduct periodic laboratory evaluations.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to diclofenac sodium of 911 patients treated between 4 and 12 weeks (mean duration of 49 days) in seven Phase 3 controlled trials, as well as exposure of 793 patients treated in an open-label study, including 463 patients treated for at least 6 months, and 144 patients treated for at least 12 months. The population mean age was approximately 60 years, 89% of patients were Caucasians, 64% were females, and all patients had primary osteoarthritis. The most common adverse events with diclofenac sodium were application site skin reactions. These events were the most common reason for withdrawing from the studies.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Application Site Reactions</span></p><p>In controlled trials, the most common treatment-related adverse events in patients receiving diclofenac sodium topical solution were application site skin reactions. Application site reactions were characterized by one or more of the following: dryness, erythema, induration, vesicles, paresthesia, pruritus, vasodilation, acne, and urticaria. The most frequent of these reactions were dry skin (32%), contact dermatitis characterized by skin erythema and induration (9%), contact dermatitis with vesicles (2%) and pruritus (4%). In one controlled trial, a higher rate of contact dermatitis with vesicles (4%) was observed after treatment of 152 subjects with the combination of diclofenac sodium topical solution and oral diclofenac. In the open label uncontrolled long-term safety study, contact dermatitis occurred in 13% and contact dermatitis with vesicles in 10% of patients, generally within the first 6 months of exposure, leading to a withdrawal rate for an application site event of 14%.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Adverse Events Common to the NSAID Class</span></p><p>In controlled trials, subjects treated with diclofenac sodium experienced some adverse events associated with the NSAID class more frequently than subjects using placebo (constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, edema; see <span class="Bold">Table 1</span>). The combination of diclofenac sodium topical solution and oral diclofenac, compared to oral diclofenac alone, resulted in a higher rate of rectal hemorrhage (3% vs. less than 1%), and more frequent abnormal creatinine (12% vs. 7%), urea (20% vs. 12%), and hemoglobin (13% vs. 9%), but no difference in elevation of liver transaminases.</p><p>Table 1 lists all adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% of patients receiving diclofenac sodium topical solution, where the rate in the diclofenac sodium topical solution group exceeded placebo, from seven controlled studies conducted in patients with osteoarthritis. Since these trials were of different durations, these percentages do not capture cumulative rates of occurrence.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">In non-U.S. postmarketing surveillance, the following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of diclofenac sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Body as a Whole</span></p><p>Abdominal pain, accidental injury, allergic reaction, asthenia, back pain, body odor, chest pain, edema, face edema, halitosis, headache, lack of drug effect, neck rigidity, pain</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Cardiovascular</span></p><p>Palpitation, cardiovascular disorder</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Digestive</span></p><p>Diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, gastroenteritis, decreased appetite, mouth ulceration, nausea, rectal hemorrhage, ulcerative stomatitis</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Metabolic and Nutritional</span></p><p>Creatinine increased</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Musculoskeletal</span></p><p>Leg cramps, myalgia</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Nervous</span></p><p>Depression, dizziness, drowsiness, lethargy, paresthesia, paresthesia at application site</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Respiratory</span></p><p>Asthma, dyspnea, laryngismus, laryngitis, pharyngitis</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Skin and Appendages</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">At the Application Site</span>:</span> Contact dermatitis, contact dermatitis with vesicles, dry skin, pruritus, rash;</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Other Skin and Appendages Adverse Reactions:</span> Eczema, rash, pruritus, skin discoloration, urticaria</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Special Senses</span></p><p>Abnormal vision, blurred vision, cataract, ear pain, eye disorder, eye pain, taste perversion</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.</li>
<li>Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol).</li>
<li>In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure.

<li>When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter.</li>
</ul><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C prior to 30 weeks gestation; Category D starting 30 weeks gestation</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the riskof premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodiumtopical solution, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester).</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium topical solution in pregnantwomen. Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in womenin the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, allclinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2 to 4% formajor malformations, and 15 to 20% for pregnancy loss. Published reproductive and developmental studies of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, the solvent used in diclofenac sodium topical solution) are equivocal as to potential teratogenicity. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in mice, rats, or rabbits given diclofenac daily during the period of organogenesis atdoses up to approximately 0.6, 0.6, and 1.3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of diclofenac sodium, despite the presence of maternal and fetal toxicity at these doses <span class="Italics">[seeData].</span> Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrialvascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization.

Published animal studies have shown that administration prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay inovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are a greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.13)].</span></p><p>Of the 911 patients treated with diclofenac sodium in seven controlled, Phase 3 clinical trials, 444 subjects were 65 years of age and over.

There are no specific antidotes. Emesis is not recommended due to a possibility of aspiration and subsequentrespiratory irritation by DMSO contained in diclofenac sodium topical solution. Consider activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/orosmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a largeoverdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.

It is a white to off-white crystalline powder, hygroscopic that is freely soluble in methanol, soluble in ethanol (96 %), sparingly soluble in water, practically insoluble in chloroform and in ether. The molecular weight is 318.14. Its molecular formula is CHClNNaO and it has the following structural formula:</p><p>Each 1 mL of solution contains 16.05 mg of diclofenac sodium.</p><p>The inactive ingredients in diclofenac sodium topical solution include: alcohol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 45.5% w/w), glycerin, propylene glycol and purified water.</p><h2>Biifenac 1000 - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism Of Action</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.</p><p>The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2)</p><p>Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">After topical administration to healthy human volunteers of single and multiple maximum doses of diclofenac sodium topical solution, 40 drops (approximately 1.2 mL) to each knee (80 drops total dose), the following diclofenac pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained: (see <span class="Bold">Table 3</span>).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>Diclofenac systemic exposure from diclofenac sodium topical solution application (4 times daily for 1week) was approximately 1/3 of the diclofenac systemic exposure from the Solaraze (diclofenac topical gel) application (twice daily for 4 weeks).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin.</p><p>Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Elimination</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Metabolism:</span></p><p>Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CPY2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CPY2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Excretion:</span></p><p>Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites.
