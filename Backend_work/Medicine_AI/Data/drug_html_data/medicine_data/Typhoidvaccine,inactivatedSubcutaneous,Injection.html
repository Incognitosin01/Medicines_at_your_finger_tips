It is caused by a germ called Salmonella typhi and is spread most often through infected food or water. Typhoid may also be spread by close person-to-person contact with infected persons (such as occurs with persons living in the same household). Some infected persons do not appear to be sick, but they can still spread the germ to others.</p><p>Typhoid fever is rare in the U.S. and in other areas of the world that have good water and sewage (waste) systems. However, it is a problem in parts of the world that do not have such systems. If you are traveling to certain countries, or to remote, out-of-the-way areas, typhoid vaccine will help protect you from typhoid fever. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) currently recommend caution in the following areas of the world:</p><ul>
<li>Africa</li>
<li>Asia</li>
<li>Latin America</li>
</ul><p>Typhoid vaccine given by injection helps prevent typhoid fever but does not provide 100% protection. Therefore, it is very important to avoid infected persons and food and water that may be infected, even if you have received the vaccine.</p><p>To get the best possible protection against typhoid, you should complete the vaccine dosing schedule at least 1 week before you travel to areas where you may be exposed to typhoid.</p><p>Also, if you will be traveling regularly to parts of the world where typhoid is a problem, you should get a booster (repeat) dose of the vaccine every 3 years.</p><p>Typhoid vaccine is to be used only by or under the supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using typhoid vaccine, inactivated</h2><p>In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this vaccine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to typhoid vaccine, inactivated or any other medicines.

Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults.
