It works by helping the muscles around the airways in your lungs stay relaxed to improve breathing.</p><p>Serevent Diskus is used to prevent asthma attacks or exercise-induced bronchospasm. It is also used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including emphysema and chronic bronchitis.</p><p>Serevent Diskus is not used to relieve sudden breathing problems and will not replace a rescue inhaler.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not</b> use Serevent Diskus to treat an asthma attack that has already begun.</p><p>Serevent Diskus may increase the risk of asthma-related death. <b>Use only the prescribed dose of this medication, and do not use it for longer than your doctor recommends. Follow all patient instructions for safe use.</b> Talk with your doctor about your individual risks and benefits of using this medicine.</p><p><b>If you use Serevent Diskus for asthma, you must use it together with an inhaled steroid medicine for long-term asthma control.</b> Seek medical attention if you think any of your asthma medications are not working as well as usual.</p><p>Do not use a second form of salmeterol (such as Advair) or use a similar inhaled bronchodilator such as formoterol or arformoterol (Foradil, Perforomist, Symbicort, or Brovana) unless your doctor has told you to.</p><p>Seek medical attention if you think any of your asthma medications are not working as well as usual. An increased need for medication could be an early sign of a serious asthma attack. If you use a peak flow meter at home, call your doctor if your numbers are lower than normal.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Serevent Diskus if you are allergic to salmeterol or to milk proteins.</p><p>To make sure Serevent Diskus is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Serevent may increase the risk of asthma-related death.</p><p><b>Serevent Diskus is not a rescue medicine for asthma attacks.</b> Use only fast-acting inhalation medicine for an attack. Seek medical attention if your breathing problems get worse quickly, or if you think your asthma medications are not working as well. An increased need for medication could be an early sign of a serious asthma attack. If you use a peak flow meter at home, call your doctor if your numbers are lower than normal.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Serevent Diskus is a powder form of salmeterol inhalation that comes with a special inhaler device preloaded with blister packs containing measured doses of the medicine. The device opens and loads a blister each time you use the inhaler. This device is not to be used with a spacer.</p><p>Use Serevent Diskus regularly to get the most benefit. Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely.</p><p>If you use Serevent Diskus for asthma, you must use it together with an inhaled steroid medicine for long-term asthma control. Use all asthma medications as directed. Your dose needs may change due to surgery, illness, stress, or a recent asthma attack. Do not change your dose or dosing schedule without your doctor's advice.</p><p>Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve after 7 days.</p><p>Do not stop using Serevent Diskus without first talking to your doctor. Your asthma symptoms may get worse after you stop using the medication.</p><p>If you also use a steroid medication, you should not stop using it suddenly. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.</p><p>Do not try to clean or take apart the Diskus device. Throw it away 6 weeks after you have taken it out of the foil pouch, or if the dose indicator shows a zero, whichever comes first. Each Diskus device contains 60 doses.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and sunlight.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Skip the missed dose and use your next dose at the regular time. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><p>Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using Serevent Diskus?</h2><p>Do not exhale or blow into the Diskus device.
