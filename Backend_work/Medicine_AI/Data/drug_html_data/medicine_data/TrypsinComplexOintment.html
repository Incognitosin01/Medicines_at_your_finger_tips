Also, Balsam Peru has a mildly bactericidal action. Castor Oil is used to promote epithelialization by reducing premature epithelial desiccation and cornification. Also, it can act as a protective covering and aids in the reduction of pain. Trypsin is intended for debridement of eschar and other necrotic tissue. It appears that in many instances removal of wound debris strengthens humoral defense mechanisms sufficiently to retard proliferation of local pathogens.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">To aid in the care of wound management, including decubitus ulcers, varicose ulcers and dehiscent wounds.</p><h2>USES</h2><p class="First">Trypsin Complex Ointment is easy to apply and quickly reduces odor frequently accompanying a decubitus ulcer. The wound may be left open or appropriate dressing applied. As a suggestion, keep in mind wounds heal poorly in the presence of hemoglobin or zinc deficiency. Trypsin Complex Ointment can relieve pain and aid in the management of healing.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First">Do not apply to fresh arterial clots. Avoid contact with eyes. <span class="Bold">Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children.</span> In case of accidental overdose seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Use only as directed. When applied to a sensitive area, a temporary stinging sensation may be noted.</p><h2>DOSAGE</h2><p class="First">Apply a thin film of Trypsin Complex Ointment a minimum of twice daily or as often as necessary. Wound may be left unbandaged or appropriate dressing applied. To remove, wash gently with appropriate cleanser.</p><h2>How is Trypsin Complex Ointment Supplied</h2><p class="First">Trypsin Complex Ointment is supplied in 60 gram tubes.
