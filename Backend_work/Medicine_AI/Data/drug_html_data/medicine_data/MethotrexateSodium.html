Advise pregnant women with neoplastic diseases of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Published data from case reports, literature reviews, and observational studies report that methotrexate exposure during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death. Methotrexate exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of spontaneous abortions and multiple adverse developmental outcomes, including skull anomalies, facial dysmorphism, central nervous system abnormalities, limb abnormalities, and sometimes cardiac anomalies and intellectual impairment. Adverse outcomes associated with exposure during second and third trimesters of pregnancy include intrauterine growth restriction and functional abnormalities. Because methotrexate is widely distributed and persists in the body for a prolonged period, there is a potential risk to the fetus from preconception methotrexate exposure.</p><p>A prospective multicenter study evaluated pregnancy outcomes in women taking methotrexate less than or equal to 30 mg/week after conception. The rate of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage in pregnant women exposed to methotrexate was 42% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 29, 59), which was higher than in unexposed patients with autoimmune disease (22%; 95% CI: 17, 30) and unexposed patients with nonautoimmune disease (17%; 95% CI: 13, 23). Of the live births, the rate of major birth defects in pregnant women exposed to methotrexate after conception was higher than in unexposed patients with autoimmune disease (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.8 [95% CI: 0.6, 6]) and unexposed patients with non-autoimmune disease (adjusted OR 3.1 [95% CI: 1, 10]) (2.9%).

The molecular formula is C <span class="Sub">20</span>H <span class="Sub">22</span>N <span class="Sub">8</span>O <span class="Sub">5</span> and the molecular weight is 454.4 g/mol. The structural formula is:</p><p>Methotrexate tablets, USP for oral use are available in bottles of 36 and 100 tablets. Each methotrexate tablet, USP contains 2.5 mg methotrexate, USP equivalent to 2.74 mg Methotrexate Sodium and the following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate and maize starch.</p><h2>Methotrexate Sodium - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase. Dihydrofolates must be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one-carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate. Therefore, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular replication. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells, buccal and intestinal mucosa, and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate.</p><p>The mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis and in psoriasis is unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>At doses of 30 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> or less, the mean bioavailability is approximately 60%. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 0.75 to 6 hours following oral administration. Methotrexate may undergo enterohepatic recirculation; however, this pathway has not been fully characterized.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Food</span></p><p>Food has been shown to delay absorption and reduce peak concentration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Methotrexate in serum is approximately 50% protein bound. Methotrexate does not penetrate the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier at concentrations achieved with the recommended dosages.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>The elimination half-life of methotrexate is approximately 3 to 10 hours. Small amounts of methotrexate polyglutamates may remain in tissues for extended periods. The retention and prolonged drug action of these active metabolites vary among different cells, tissues, and tumors. Nonlinear elimination due to saturation of renal tubular reabsorption has been observed in studies of patients with psoriasis receiving methotrexate doses between 7.5 mg and 30 mg.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Methotrexate is partially metabolized by intestinal flora after oral administration.</p><p>Methotrexate primarily undergoes hepatic and intracellular metabolism to active polyglutamated forms which can be converted back to methotrexate by hydrolase enzymes. Methotrexate also undergoes minor metabolism to active 7-hydroxymethotrexate.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Methotrexate primarily undergoes renal excretion by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion that is dependent upon dosage and route of administration. Biliary excretion accounts for ≤10% of the methotrexate dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate is unknown.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>In pediatric patients with leukemia, oral absorption (23% to 95%) of methotrexate is variable and dose-dependent. The difference between highest and lowest peak methotrexate concentrations (C <span class="Sub">max</span> 0.11 to 2.3 micromolar after a 20 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> dose) was 20-fold. The time to peak concentration (T <span class="Sub">max</span> 0.67 to 4 hours after a 15 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> dose) and fraction of dose absorbed is variable. The absorption of doses greater than 40 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> is significantly less than that of lower doses.</p><p>In pediatric patients with pJIA, plasma concentrations of methotrexate are variable. Following oral administration of methotrexate 6.4 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>/week to 11.2 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>/week, mean serum concentrations were 0.59 micromolar (0.03 to 1.40) at 1 hour, 0.44 micromolar (0.01 to 1.00) at 2 hours, and 0.29 micromolar (0.06 to 0.58) at 3 hours.</p><p>In pediatric patients receiving methotrexate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (6.3 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> to 30 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>) or for JIA (3.75 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> to 26.2 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>), the terminal half-life has been reported to range from 0.7 to 5.8 hours or from 0.9 to 2.3 hours, respectively.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal impairment</span></p><p>The elimination half-life of methotrexate is variable and increases with the severity of renal impairment.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Methotrexate has been evaluated in a number of animal studies for carcinogenic potential with inconclusive results.
