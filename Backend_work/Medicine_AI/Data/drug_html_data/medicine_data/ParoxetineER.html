</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adult patients in short-term studies. Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Paroxetine ER</h2><p class="First">Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets, USP are indicated in adults for the treatment of:</p><ul>
<li>Major depressive disorder (MDD)</li>
<li>Panic disorder (PD)</li>
<li>Social anxiety disorder (SAD)</li>
<li>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)</li>
</ul><h2>Paroxetine ER Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Administer Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets as a single daily dose in the morning, with or without food. Swallow tablets whole and do not chew or crush.</p><h3>Dosage in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Social Anxiety Disorder</h3><p class="First">The recommended initial dosage and maximum dosage of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets in patients with MDD, PD, and SAD are presented in Table 1.</p><p>In patients with an inadequate response, dosage may be increased in increments of 12.5 mg per day at intervals of at least 1 week, depending on tolerability.</p><h3>Dosage in Patients with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dosage in women with PMDD is 12.5 mg per day. Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets may be administered either continuously (every day throughout the menstrual cycle) or intermittently (only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, i.e., starting the daily dosage 14 days prior to the anticipated onset of menstruation and continuing through the onset of menses). Intermittent dosing is repeated with each new cycle.</p><p>In patients with an inadequate response, the dosage may be increased to the maximum recommended dosage of 25 mg per day, depending on tolerability. Institute dosage adjustments at intervals of at least 1 week.</p><h3>Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets</h3><p class="First">Prior to initiating treatment with Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].</span></p><h3>Dosage Modifications for Elderly Patients, Patients with Severe Renal Impairment and Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The recommended initial dose of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets is 12.5 mg per day for elderly patients, patients with severe renal impairment, and patients with severe hepatic impairment. Reduce initial dose and increase up-titration intervals if necessary. Dosage should not exceed 50 mg per day for MDD or PD and should not exceed 37.5 mg per day for SAD <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].</span></p><h3>Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor Antidepressant</h3><p class="First">At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and initiation of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets. In addition, at least 14 days must elapse after stopping Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets before starting an MAOI antidepressant <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Discontinuation of Treatment with Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets</h3><p class="First">Adverse reactions may occur upon discontinuation of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].</span> Gradually reduce the dosage rather than stopping Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets abruptly whenever possible.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets are available as:</p><ul>

<li>With known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to paroxetine or to any of the inactive ingredients in Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]</span>.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults</h3><p class="First">In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 2.</p><p>It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.</p><p>Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and SSRIs, including Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>. Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone.</p><p>Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).</p><p>The concomitant use of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets, discontinue Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets before initiating treatment with the MAOI <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><p>Monitor all patients taking Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.</p><h3>Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">The CYP2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine can elevate plasma levels of thioridazine and pimozide. Since thioridazine and pimozide given alone produce prolongation of the QTc interval and increase the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias, the use of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets is contraindicated in combination with thioridazine and pimozide <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Embryofetal and Neonatal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations. Exposure to paroxetine in late pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPNH) and/or neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding.</p><p>If Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets are used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><h3>Increased Risk of Bleeding</h3><p class="First">Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.</p><p>Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio.</p><h3>Activation of Mania or Hypomania</h3><p class="First">In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. During controlled clinical trials of immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1% of paroxetine-treated unipolar patients compared to 1.1% of active-control and 0.3% of placebo-treated unipolar patients. Prior to initiating treatment with Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.</p><h3>Discontinuation Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].</span></p><p>Adverse reactions have been reported upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets have not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder and should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures.</p><h3>Angle-Closure Glaucoma</h3><p class="First">The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Cases of angle-closure glaucoma associated with use of paroxetine hydrochloride tablets have been reported. Avoid use of antidepressants, including Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.</p><h3>Hyponatremia</h3><p class="First">Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).</p><p>In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SNRIs and SSRIs. <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].</span></p><h3>Reduction of Efficacy of Tamoxifen</h3><p class="First">Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen, as measured by the risk of breast cancer relapse/mortality, may be reduced with concomitant use of paroxetine as a result of paroxetine's irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6 and lower blood levels of tamoxifen <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>. One study suggests that the risk may increase with longer duration of coadministration. However, other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk. When tamoxifen is used for the treatment or prevention of breast cancer, prescribers should consider using an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition.</p><h3>Bone Fracture</h3><p class="First">Epidemiological studies on bone fracture risk during exposure to some antidepressants, including SSRIs, have reported an association between antidepressant treatment and fractures. There are multiple possible causes for this observation and it is unknown to what extent fracture risk is directly attributable to SSRI treatment.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are included in more detail in other sections of the prescribing information:</p><ul>
<li>Hypersensitivity reactions to paroxetine <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span></li>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Safety data for Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets is from 11 short-term, placebo-controlled clinical trials including 3 studies in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1, 2, and 3), 3 studies in patients with panic disorder (PD) (Studies 4, 5, and 6), 1 study in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) (Study 7), and 4 studies in female patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) (Studies 8, 9, 10, and 11) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. These 11 trials included 1627 patients treated with Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets.</p><ul>
<li>Studies 1 and 2 were 12-week studies that enrolled patients 18 to 65 years old who received Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets at doses ranging from 25 mg to 62.5 mg once daily. Study 3 was a 12-week study in patients 60 to 88 years old who received Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 50 mg once daily.</li>
<li>Studies 4, 5, and 6 were 10-week studies in patients 19 to 72 years old who received Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 75 mg once daily.</li>
<li>Study 7 was a 12-week study that enrolled adult patients who received Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 37.5 mg once daily.</li>
<li>Studies 8, 9, and 10 were 12-week, placebo-controlled trials in female patients 18 to 46 years old who received Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets at doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg once daily. Study 11 was a 12-week placebo-controlled trial in patients 18 to 46 years old who received Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses (luteal phase dosing) at doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg once daily.</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with MDD, PD, SAD, and PMDD</span></p><p>In pooled studies in patients with MDD, PD and SAD, the most common adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal were: nausea (up to 4% of patients), asthenia, headache, depression, insomnia, and abnormal liver function tests (each occurring in up to 2% of patients), and dizziness, somnolence, and diarrhea (each occurring in up to 1% of patients).</p><p>In pooled studies for PMDD, the most common adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal were: nausea (occurring in up to 6% of patients), asthenia (occurring in up to 5% of patients), somnolence (occurring in up to 4% of patients), insomnia (occurring in approximately 2% of patients); and impaired concentration, dry mouth, dizziness, decreased appetite, sweating, tremor, yawn and diarrhea (occurring in less than or equal to 2% of patients).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in MDD, PD, and SAD</span></p><p>Table 3 presents the most common adverse reactions in Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets-treated patients (incidence ≥5% and greater than placebo within at least 1 of the indications) in controlled trials in patients with MDD, PD, and SAD.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets</span></p><p>Adverse reactions from studies in MDD (not including Study 3 in elderly patients), PD, and SAD that occurred between 1% and 5% of patients treated with Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets and at a rate greater than in placebo-treated patients include:, allergic reaction, tachycardia, vasodilatation, hypertension, migraine, vomiting, weight loss, weight gain, hypertonia, paresthesia, agitation, confusion, myoclonus, concentration impaired, depression, rhinitis, cough increased, bronchitis, photosensitivity, eczema, taste perversion, UTI, menstrual disorder, urinary frequency, urination impaired, and vaginitis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Patients with PMDD</span></p><p>Table 4 displays adverse reactions that occurred (incidence of 5% or more and greater than placebo within at least 1 of the studies) in patients treated with Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets in Studies 8, 9, 10, and 11.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose Dependent Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Comparison of the incidence of adverse reactions (placebo vs. 12.5 mg Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets vs. 25 mg Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets) from studies 8, 9, 10 showed the following adverse reactions to be dose-related: Nausea, somnolence, sweating, dry mouth, dizziness, decreased appetite, tremor, impaired concentration, yawn, paresthesia, hyperkinesia, and vaginitis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction</span></p><p>Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of SSRI treatment. However, reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, in part because patients and healthcare providers may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in labeling may underestimate their actual incidence.</p><p>The percentage of patients reporting symptoms of sexual dysfunction in the Studies 1 and 2 (nonelderly patients with MDD), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are presented in Table 5:</p><p>Paroxetine treatment has been associated with several cases of priapism.

If paroxetine is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, advise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p><ul>
<li>A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that infants exposed to paroxetine during pregnancy (n = 815) had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (2% risk in paroxetine-exposed infants) compared to the entire registry population (1% risk), for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8). No increase in the risk of overall congenital malformations was seen in the paroxetine-exposed infants. The cardiac malformations in the paroxetine-exposed infants were primarily ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and atrial septal defects (ASDs). Septal defects range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those which require surgery.</li>
<li>A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States (United Healthcare data) evaluated 5,956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester (n = 815 for paroxetine). This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations for paroxetine (risk of 1.5%) compared to other antidepressants (risk of 1%), for an OR of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9). Of the 12 paroxetine-exposed infants with cardiovascular malformations, 9 had VSDs. This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine (4% risk) compared to other (2% risk) antidepressants (OR 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8).</li>
<li>Two large case-control studies using separate databases, each with &gt;9,000 birth defect cases and &gt;4,000 controls, found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstructions. In one study the OR was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.0, 7 exposed infants) and in the other study the OR was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.8, 6 exposed infants).</li>
</ul><p>Other studies have found varying results as to whether there was an increased risk of overall, cardiovascular, or specific congenital malformations. A meta-analysis of epidemiological data over a 16-year period (1992 to 2008) on first trimester paroxetine use in pregnancy and congenital malformations included the above-noted studies in addition to others (n = 17 studies that included overall malformations and n = 14 studies that included cardiovascular malformations; n = 20 distinct studies). While subject to limitations, this meta-analysis suggested an increased occurrence of cardiovascular malformations (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.9) and overall malformations (POR 1.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4) with paroxetine use during the first trimester. It was not possible in this meta-analysis to determine the extent to which the observed prevalence of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to that of overall malformations, nor was it possible to determine whether any specific types of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to the observed prevalence of all cardiovascular malformations.</p><p>Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>. For women who intend to become pregnant or are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment of Pregnant Women During Their Third Trimester</span>: Neonates exposed to SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome.

It is the hydrochloride salt of a phenylpiperidine compound identified chemically as (-)-<span class="Italics">trans</span>-4<span class="Italics">R-</span>(4'-fluorophenyl)-3<span class="Italics">S</span>-[(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenoxy) methyl] piperidine hydrochloride hemihydrate and has the empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">19</span>H<span class="Sub">20</span>FNO<span class="Sub">3</span>∙HCl∙1/2H<span class="Sub">2</span>O. The molecular weight is 374.8 g/mol (329.4 g/mol as free base). The structural formula of paroxetine hydrochloride is:</p><p></p><p>Paroxetine hydrochloride is an odorless, off-white powder, having a melting point range of 120°C to 138°C and a solubility of 5.4 mg/mL in water.</p><p>Each enteric coated, extended-release tablet contains paroxetine base of 12.5 mg (white tablet), 25 mg (brown tablet), 37.5 mg (orange tablet), which is equivalent to 14.25 mg, 28.51 mg, or 42.76 mg of paroxetine hydrochloride, respectively.

In addition, the 25 mg tablets also contain the following coloring agents: iron oxide black and iron oxide red and the 37.5 mg tablets contain iron oxide red and iron oxide yellow.</p><p>USP dissolution test is pending.</p><h2>Paroxetine ER - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of paroxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is unknown, but is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake (SSRI) and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets contain a degradable polymeric matrix designed to control the dissolution rate of paroxetine over a period of approximately 4 to 5 hours. In addition to controlling the rate of drug release <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>, an enteric coat delays the start of drug release until Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets have left the stomach.</p><p>Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets are completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. In a study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received single oral doses of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets at 4 dosage strengths (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg), paroxetine C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span> increased disproportionately with dose (as seen also with immediate-release formulations). Mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span> values at these doses were 2.0, 5.5, 9.0, and 12.5 ng/mL, and 121, 261, 338, and 540 ng∙hr. /mL, respectively. T<span class="Sub">max</span> was observed typically between 6 and 10 hours post-dose, reflecting a reduction in absorption rate compared with immediate-release formulations. The bioavailability of 25 mg Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets is not affected by food.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the plasma.</p><p>Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng/mL. Paroxetine does not alter the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>The mean elimination half-life of paroxetine was 15 to 20 hours throughout a range of single doses of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg). During repeated administration of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets (25 mg once daily), steady state was reached within 2 weeks (i.e., comparable to immediate-release formulations). In a repeat-dose study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets (25 mg daily), mean steady state C<span class="Sub">max</span>, C<span class="Sub">min</span>, and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> values were 30 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 550 ng∙hr./mL, respectively.</p><p>Based on studies using immediate-release formulations, steady-state drug exposure based on AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> was several-fold greater than would have been predicted from single-dose data. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that 1 of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable.</p><p>In steady-state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of the immediate-release formulation of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway (Figure 3).</p><p>Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug-drug interactions <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Approximately 64% of a 30-mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10-day post-dosing period. About 36% was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10-day post-dosing period.</p><p>The elimination half-life is approximately 15 to 20 hours after a single dose of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets. Paroxetine metabolism is mediated in part by CYP2D6, and the metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine and to some extent in the feces. Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p>There are clinically significant, known drug interactions between paroxetine and other drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1.

These doses are up to approximately 1.6 (mouse) and 2.5 (rat) times the MRHD on an mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. There was a significantly greater number of male rats in the high-dose group with reticulum cell sarcomas (1/100, 0/50, 0/50, and 4/50 for control, low-, middle-, and high-dose groups, respectively) and a significantly increased linear trend across dose groups for the occurrence of lymphoreticular tumors in male rats. Female rats were not affected. Although there was a dose-related increase in the number of tumors in mice, there was no drug-related increase in the number of mice with tumors. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Paroxetine produced no genotoxic effects in a battery of 5 <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and 2 <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> assays that included the following: Bacterial mutation assay, mouse lymphoma mutation assay, unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and tests for cytogenetic aberrations <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in mouse bone marrow and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in human lymphocytes and in a dominant lethal test in rats.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Some clinical studies have shown that SSRIs (including paroxetine) may affect sperm quality during SSRI treatment, which may affect fertility in some men.</p><p>A reduced pregnancy rate was found in reproduction studies in rats at a dose of paroxetine of 15 mg/kg/day, which is approximately twice the MRHD on an mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Irreversible lesions occurred in the reproductive tract of male rats after dosing in toxicity studies for 2 to 52 weeks. These lesions consisted of vacuolation of epididymal tubular epithelium at 50 mg/kg/day and atrophic changes in the seminiferous tubules of the testes with arrested spermatogenesis at 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 and 3 times the MRHD on an mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Major Depressive Disorder</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) was established in two 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose studies with Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets (Study 1 and Study 2) in adult patients who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria for MDD. Study 1 and 2 included patients 18 to 65 years old who received Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets doses of 25 to 62.5 mg/day (N= 212) or placebo (N= 211) once daily compared to immediate-release paroxetine 20 to 50 mg (N=217). A third 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose study with Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets (Study 3) included elderly patients, ranging in age from 60 to 88 years old and used Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets doses of 12.5 to 50 mg/day (N=104) or placebo (N=109) once daily compared to immediate-release paroxetine 10 to 40 mg (N=106). In all three studies, Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets were statistically superior to placebo in improving depressive symptoms as measured by the following: the mean change from baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) total score at Week 12, the mean change from baseline in the Hamilton Depressed Mood item score at Week 12, and the mean change from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)–Severity of Illness score.</p><p>Long-term efficacy of paroxetine for treatment of MDD in outpatients was established with one randomized withdrawal study with immediate-release paroxetine. Patients who responded to immediate-release paroxetine (HDRS total score &lt;8) during an initial 8-week open-label treatment phase were then randomized to continue immediate-release paroxetine or placebo, for up to 1 year. Patients treated with immediate-release paroxetine demonstrated a statistically significant lower relapse rate during the withdrawal phase (15%) compared to those on placebo (39%). Effectiveness was similar for male and female patients.</p><h3>Panic Disorder</h3><p class="First">The effectiveness of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets in the treatment of panic disorder (PD) was evaluated in three 10-week, multicenter, flexible-dose studies (Studies 4, 5, and 6) comparing Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets (12.5 to 75 mg daily) to placebo in adult outpatients 19 to 72 years of age who met panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) criteria according to DSM-IV. These trials were assessed on the basis of their outcomes on 3 variables: (1) the proportions of patients free of full panic attacks at Week 10; (2) change from baseline to Week 10 in the median number of full panic attacks; and (3) change from baseline to Week 10 in the median Clinical Global Impression Severity score. For Studies 4 and 5, Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets were superior to placebo on 2 of these 3 variables. Study 6 failed to consistently demonstrate a statistically significant difference between Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets and placebo on any of these variables.</p><p>For all 3 studies, the mean dose of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets for completers at Week 10 was approximately 50 mg/day. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender.</p><p>Long-term maintenance effects of paroxetine in patients with PD were demonstrated in a randomized-withdrawal study using immediate-release paroxetine. Patients who were responders during a 10-week, double-blind trial (followed by a 3-month double-blind maintenance phase) of immediate-release paroxetine were re-randomized to continue immediate-release paroxetine or placebo in a 3-month, double-blind withdrawal phase. Patients randomized to immediate-release paroxetine were statistically significantly less likely to relapse than placebo-treated patients.</p><h3>Social Anxiety Disorder</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets as a treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD) was established, in part, on the basis of extrapolation from the established effectiveness of immediate-release paroxetine in the treatment of SAD. In addition, the effectiveness of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets in the treatment of SAD was demonstrated in one 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study of adult outpatients with a primary diagnosis of SAD by DSM-IV criteria (Study 7). In Study 7, the effectiveness of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets (12.5 to 37.5 mg daily) compared to placebo was evaluated on the basis of (1) change from baseline in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) total score at Week 12 and (2) the proportion of responders who scored 1 or 2 (very much improved or much improved) on the CGI Global Improvement score at Week 12.</p><p>In Study 7, Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on both the change on LSAS total score at Week 12 and the CGI Improvement responder criterion at Week 12. For patients who completed the trial, 64% of patients treated with Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets compared to 35% of patients treated with placebo were CGI Improvement responders at Week 12.</p><p>Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of gender. Subgroup analyses of studies utilizing the immediate-release formulation of paroxetine generally did not indicate differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age, race, or gender.</p><h3>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder</h3><p class="First">The effectiveness of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets for the treatment of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) utilizing a continuous dosing regimen has been established in 2 placebo-controlled trials in female patients ages 18 to 46 (Studies 8 and 9 [N=672]). Patients in these trials met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD. Of 1,030 patients including Study 10, who were treated with daily doses of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets 12.5 or 25 mg/day, or placebo continuously throughout the menstrual cycle for a period of 3 menstrual cycles, the mean duration of the PMDD symptoms was approximately 11 ± 7 years. Patients on systemic hormonal contraceptives were excluded from these trials. Therefore, the efficacy of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets in combination with systemic (including oral) hormonal contraceptives for the continuous daily treatment of PMDD is unknown.</p><p>The VAS score is a patient-rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria of PMDD as identified in the DSM-IV, and includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms, and other symptoms associated with PMDD. In Studies 8 and 9, 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets were statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline to Month 3 on the luteal phase VAS score.</p><p>In an additional study employing luteal phase dosing (Study 11), patients (N = 366) were treated for the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses with 12.5 or 25 mg/day of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets or placebo for a period of 3 months. In this trial,12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets, as luteal phase dosing, was statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline to luteal phase VAS score at Month 3.</p><p>There is insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome in Studies 8, 9, 10, and 11.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Paroxetine Extended-Release Tablets, USP are supplied as: a round, extended-release tablet as follows:</p><ul>
