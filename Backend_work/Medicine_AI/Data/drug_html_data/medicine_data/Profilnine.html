</ul><h2>Profilnine Description</h2><p class="First">Profilnine<span class="Sup">®</span>, Factor IX Complex, is a solvent/detergent treated, nanofiltered, sterile, lyophilized concentrate of coagulation factors IX, II, X, and low levels of factor VII. The factor II content is not more than (NMT) 150 units* per 100 factor IX units, the factor X content is NMT 100 units per 100 factor IX units, and the factor VII content is NMT 35 units per 100 factor IX units. Profilnine does not contain heparin and contains no preservatives. Profilnine contains few, if any, activated factors based on results from the non-activated partial thromboplastin time (NAPTT) test<span class="Sup">1</span><span class="Sup">,2</span>.</p><p>Profilnine is intended for intravenous administration only. Each vial is a single-dose container and is labeled with the factor IX potency expressed in International Units.</p><p>Profilnine is prepared from pooled human plasma and purified by diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose adsorption. The risk of transmission of infective agents by Profilnine has been substantially reduced by donor selection procedures and virus screening of individual donations and plasma pools by serological and nucleic acid testing. In addition, virus elimination steps such as nanofiltration<span class="Sup">3</span> and solvent/detergent (tri-n-butyl phosphate) treatment<span class="Sup">4</span> have been incorporated into the Profilnine manufacturing process. Additional removal of some viruses occurs during the DEAE cellulose product purification step.</p><p>The ability of the manufacturing process to eliminate virus from Profilnine was evaluated in the laboratory by intentionally adding virus to product just prior to the elimination step and monitoring virus removal. Table 1 shows the amounts of virus that can be removed by solvent/detergent treatment, nanofiltration, and purification by DEAE chromatography when vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), human immunodeficiency virus-1 and 2 (HIV-1, HIV-2), parvovirus, West Nile virus (WNV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), and pseudorabies virus (PRV) were evaluated in these virus spiking studies. The results indicate that the solvent/detergent treatment step inactivates enveloped viruses and the nanofiltration step removes both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.</p><p>___________________________________<br/>
* Unit refers to International Unit in the labeling of Profilnine.</p><p class="First Footnote">* Porcine, NT=Not tested, Env=Enveloped</p><h2>Profilnine - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Profilnine is a mixture of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors IX, II, X, and low levels of VII. The administration of Profilnine temporarily increases the plasma levels of factor IX, thus enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency.</p><p>A clinical study that evaluated twelve subjects with hemophilia B indicated that, following administration of Profilnine, the factor IX in vivo half-life was 24.68 ± 8.29 hours and recovery was 1.15 ± 0.16 units/dL per unit infused per kg body weight.</p><p>Administration of Factor IX Complex can result in higher than normal levels of factor II due to the significantly longer half-life of factor II<span class="Sup">5</span>.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Profilnine</h2><p class="First">Profilnine, Factor IX Complex, is indicated for the prevention and control of bleeding in patients with factor IX deficiency (hemophilia B).</p><p>Profilnine contains non-therapeutic levels of factor VII and is not indicated for use in the treatment of factor VII deficiency.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None known.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><h3>Transmissible Infectious Agents</h3><p class="First">Because Profilnine is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) agent and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent.</p><h3>Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Patients can develop neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) after treatment with Profilnine. Monitor patients for inhibitors, which should be quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) using appropriate laboratory testing.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, has been reported. Inform patients of the early symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity reaction, including hives, generalized urticaria, angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, wheezing, faintness, hypotension, tachycardia, and anaphylaxis.</p><h3>Thrombosis</h3><p class="First">The use of factor IX complex concentrates has been associated with the development of thromboembolic complications. Patients at increased risk for thrombosis include those undergoing surgery, post surgery, with known liver disease, and with signs of fibrinolysis<span class="Bold">,</span> thrombosis, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)<span class="Sup">5</span>. When administering Profilnine to these high-risk patients, monitor for early signs of consumptive coagulopathy with appropriate laboratory testing. Only administer Profilnine to patients when the benefits outweigh the risks.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Vasomotor reactions may result from overly rapid administration. Do not exceed the recommended infusion rate of 10 mL/min.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Advise patients to report to their physician any decrease in effectiveness of Factor IX treatment, as this can indicate development of inhibitors.</p><p>Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, has been reported for factor IX complex concentrate products. Inform patients of the early symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity reaction, including hives, rash, swelling, chest tightness, shortness of breath, wheezing, faintness, decrease in blood pressure, and rapid heartbeat. Advise patients to discontinue use of the product and contact their physician and/or seek immediate emergency care if these symptoms occur.</p><h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Profilnine. It is also not known whether Profilnine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Only give Profilnine to a pregnant woman if clearly indicated.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Natural Rubber Latex Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">Certain components used in the packaging of this product contain natural rubber latex. In patients with sensitivity to natural rubber latex, use Profilnine only if needed.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions with Profilnine may include headache, fever, chills, flushing, nausea, vomiting, tingling, lethargy, urticaria, and manifestations of allergic reactions.</p><p>The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Profilnine: hypersensitivity reactions including shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and hypotension, as well as thrombosis including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and inhibitor development. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Grifols at 1-888-GRIFOLS (1-888-474-3657) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or <span class="Bold">www.fda.gov/medwatch</span>.</p><h2>Profilnine Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dose</h3><p class="First">Each vial of Profilnine is labeled with total units expressed as International Units (IU). According to the WHO International Standard, one unit approximates the activity in one mL of normal plasma.</p><p>A 1% increase in factor IX (0.01 units) per unit administered per kg body weight can be expected<span class="Sup">1</span>. The amount of Profilnine required to establish hemostasis will vary with each patient and circumstance. Use the following formula and example as guides in determining the number of units to be administered:</p><p>Due to variability among patients and their clinical condition, monitor the factor IX level of each patient frequently during replacement therapy.</p><p>Table 2 below provides treatment guidelines for hemorrhagic events and surgery in patients with factor IX deficiency.</p><p>Dosing requirements and frequency of dosing are calculated on the basis of an initial response of 1% FIX increase achieved per IU of FIX infused per kg body weight and an average half-life for FIX of 24 hours. If dosing studies reveal that a particular patient exhibits a lower response, monitor blood levels and adjust the dose accordingly.</p><h3>Reconstitution</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Use Aseptic Technique</span></p><h2>Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For intravenous administration only,</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Inspect the final solution visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.</li>
<li>Administer the prepared drug at room temperature within three hours after reconstitution. Prompt administration is recommended to avoid ill effects of any inadvertent bacterial contamination occurring during reconstitution.</li>
<li>Administer by intravenous injection (plastic disposable syringe only) or infusion at a rate not exceeding 10 mL/minute.</li>
<li>Discard any unused Profilnine vial contents. Discard administration equipment into the appropriate safety container after single use. Do not resterilize components. Do not reuse components.</li>
</ul><h2>How is Profilnine Supplied</h2><p class="First">Profilnine is supplied in sterile lyophilized form in single-dose vials accompanied by a suitable volume of diluent (Sterile Water for Injection, USP), according to factor IX potency. Each vial is labeled with the factor IX potency expressed in International Units which is referenced to the WHO International Standard. Profilnine is packaged with a Mix2Vial filter transfer set for use in administration.</p><p>The product is available in several potencies, with carton and vial label color coded based upon assay as follows:</p><p>The diluent vial stopper contains natural rubber latex. All other components of the kit are not made with natural rubber latex.</p><h3>STORAGE</h3><p class="First">Profilnine is stable for three years, up to the expiration date printed on its label, provided that the storage temperature does not exceed 25 °C (77 °F). Do not freeze.</p><p><span class="Bold">Rx only</span></p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">Manufactured by:<br/>
