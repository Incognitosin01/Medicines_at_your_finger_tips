</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for ProSol</h2><p class="First">ProSol is indicated as a source of amino acids for patients requiring parenteral nutrition when oral or enteral nutrition is not possible, insufficient, or contraindicated. ProSol may be used to treat negative nitrogen balance in patients.</p><h2>ProSol Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Preparation Information</h3><p class="First">ProSol is supplied as a pharmacy bulk package for <span class="Italics">admixing only</span> and is <span class="Italics">not for direct intravenous infusion</span>. Prior to administration, ProSol <span class="Italics">must be transferred to a separate</span> <span class="Italics">parenteral nutrition container, diluted</span> and used as an admixture with or without dextrose, electrolytes and/or lipid emulsion.</p><h3>Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">ProSol is <span class="Italics">for admixing use only. It is not for direct intravenous infusion.</span> Prior to administration, ProSol <span class="Italics">must be diluted</span> with other compatible intravenous fluids or used as an admixture with or without dextrose, electrolytes and/or lipid emulsion.</p><h3>2.3 Preparation Instructions for Admixing Using a Parenteral Nutrition Container</h3><h3>Dosing Considerations</h3><h3>Recommended Dosage in Adults</h3><p class="First">The recommended adult daily dosage of ProSol and the nutritional requirements for protein (nitrogen) are shown in<span class="Bold">Table 1.</span></p><p>As a component of parenteral nutrition, ProSol provides 0.2 g protein/mL, which corresponds to 0.032 g nitrogen/mL.</p><p>As indicated on an individual basis, vitamins, electrolytes, trace elements and other components (including dextrose, electrolytes and lipid emulsion) can be added to the parenteral nutrition solution to meet nutrient needs and prevent deficiencies and complications from developing.</p><p>A maximum fluid supply of 40 mL/kg/day of parenteral nutrition solution, based on protein, should not be exceeded in adult patients; this volume does not take carbohydrates or electrolytes into consideration.</p><p class="First">Stable Patients</p><p class="First">0.8 to 1.0</p><p class="First">0.13 to 0.16</p><p class="First">4 to 5</p><p class="First">Critically Ill Patients†</p><p class="First">1.5 to 2.0</p><p class="First">0.24 to 0.32</p><p class="First">7.5 to 10</p><p>The flow rate of the parenteral nutrition solution must be adjusted taking into account the dose being administered, the daily volume intake, and the duration of the infusion. The flow rate should be increased gradually and governed, especially during the first few days of therapy, by the patient’s tolerance to dextrose. Daily intake of ProSol and dextrose should be increased gradually to the maximum required dose as indicated by frequent determinations of blood glucose levels.</p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Prior to administration, correct severe fluid or electrolyte imbalances. Closely monitor serum electrolyte levels and adjust the volume of parenteral nutrition administered as required <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].</span></p><p>Patients with renal impairment not needing dialysis require 0.6 to 0.8 g of protein/kg/day. Serum electrolyte levels should be closely monitored. Patients on hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy should receive 1.2 to 1.8 g of protein/kg/day up to a maximum of 2.5 g of protein/kg/day based on nutritional status and estimated protein losses.<span class="Sup">2</span></p><h3>Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">The dosage and constant infusion rate of intravenous dextrose must be selected with caution in pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low weight infants, because of the increased risk of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span> Frequent monitoring of serum glucose concentrations is required when dextrose is prescribed to pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants. The infusion rate and volume should be determined by the consulting physician experienced in pediatric intravenous fluid therapy.</p><p>In pediatric patients, ProSol is dosed on the basis of protein provided as amino acids. The recommended dosage, by age group is provided in Table 2.</p><p>Infusion rates are based on protein and do not take carbohydrates, fluid or electrolytes into consideration.</p><p>ProSol does not contain the amino acids cysteine and taurine, considered conditionally essential for neonates and infants. If possible, these amino acids should be added to the parenteral nutrition admixtures if used in this pediatric population.</p><p class="First">Preterm and term infants less than 1 month of age</p><p class="First">3 to 4</p><p class="First">0.48 to 0.64</p><p class="First">15 to 20</p><p class="First">Pediatric patients &gt; 1 month to 1 year of age</p><p class="First">2 to 3</p><p class="First">0.32 to 0.48</p><p class="First">10 to 15</p><p class="First">Pediatric patients 1 to 10 years of age</p><p class="First">1 to 2</p><p class="First">0.16 to 0.32</p><p class="First">5 to 10</p><p class="First">Pediatric patients 11 to 17 years of age</p><p class="First">0.8 to 1.5</p><p class="First">0.13 to 0.24</p><p class="First">4 to 7.5</p><h3>Discontinuation of Parenteral Nutrition</h3><p class="First">To reduce the risk of hypoglycemia after discontinuation, a gradual decrease in flow rate in the last hour of infusion should be considered when administering parenteral nutrition solutions containing dextrose.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">ProSol 20% is a sterile solution of 20 grams of amino acids per 100 mL (0.2 gram/mL) available in 2000 mL flexible containers.

In some cases, fatal outcomes due to pulmonary embolism have occurred. ProSol contains no added phosphorus. Patients, especially those with hypophosphatemia, may require the addition of phosphate. To prevent hypocalcemia, calcium supplementation should always accompany phosphate administration. Excessive addition of calcium and phosphate increases the risk of the formation of calcium phosphate precipitates. Precipitates have been reported even in the absence of phosphate salt in the solution. Precipitation following passage through an in-line filter and suspected in vivo precipitate formation has also been reported. If signs of pulmonary distress occur, stop the infusion and initiate a medical evaluation. In addition to inspection of the solution <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4)]</span>, the infusion set and catheter should also periodically be checked for precipitates.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with parenteral nutrition solutions containing ProSol. Stop the infusion immediately and treat patient accordingly if any signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction develop. Signs or symptoms may include: hypotension, hypertension, peripheral cyanosis, tachycardia, dyspnea, vomiting, nausea, urticaria, rash, pruritus, erythema, hyperhidrosis, pyrexia, and chills.</p><h3>Risk of Infections</h3><p class="First">Patients who require parenteral nutrition are at high risk of infections because the nutritional components of these solutions can support microbial growth. Infection and sepsis may also occur as a result of the use of intravenous catheters to administer parenteral nutrition.</p><p>The risk of infection is increased in patients with malnutrition-associated immunosuppression, hyperglycemia exacerbated by dextrose infusion, long-term use and poor maintenance of intravenous catheters, or immunosuppressive effects of other concomitant conditions, drugs, or other components of the parenteral formulation (e.g., lipid emulsion).</p><p>To decrease the risk of infection, ensure aseptic technique in catheter placement and maintenance, as well as aseptic technique in the preparation and administration of the nutritional formula.</p><p>Monitor for signs and symptoms (including fever and chills) of early infections, including laboratory test results (including leukocytosis and hyperglycemia) and frequent checks of the parenteral access device and insertion site for edema, redness and discharge.</p><h3>Refeeding Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Refeeding severely undernourished patients may result in refeeding syndrome, characterized by the intracellular shift of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium as the patient becomes anabolic. Thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop. To prevent these complications, monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increase nutrient intakes.</p><h3>Hyperglycemia or Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State</h3><p class="First">Administration of parenteral nutrition solutions containing dextrose in patients with diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance may worsen hyperglycemia. Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient’s utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia, coma, and death. Patients with underlying confusion and renal impairment who receive dextrose infusions, may be at greater risk of developing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Monitor blood glucose levels and treat hyperglycemia to maintain optimum levels while administering parenteral nutrition solutions containing dextrose. Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose levels during administration of parenteral nutrition solutions containing dextrose.</p><h3>Vein Damage and Thrombosis</h3><p class="First">ProSol must be diluted and used as an admixture with or without dextrose, electrolytes and/or lipid emulsion. It is not for direct intravenous infusion. Solutions containing more than 5% dextrose or with an osmolarity of 900 mOsmol/L or greater must be infused through a central catheter <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span> The infusion of hypertonic nutrient injections into a peripheral vein may result in vein irritation, vein damage, and/or thrombosis. The primary complication of peripheral access is venous thrombophlebitis, which manifests as pain, erythema, tenderness or a palpable cord. Remove the catheter as soon as possible, if thrombophlebitis develops.</p><h3>Hepatobiliary Disorders</h3><p class="First">Hepatobiliary disorders are known to develop in some patients without preexisting liver disease who receive parenteral nutrition, including cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, cholestasis, hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and cirrhosis, possibly leading to hepatic failure. The etiology of these disorders is thought to be multifactorial and may differ between patients.</p><p>Increase in blood ammonia levels and hyperammonemia may occur in patients receiving amino acid solutions, including ProSol. In some patients, this may indicate hepatic insufficiency or the presence of an inborn error of amino acid metabolism <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><p>Monitor liver function parameters and ammonia levels. Patients developing signs of hepatobiliary disorders should be assessed early by a clinician knowledgeable in liver diseases in order to identify possible causative and contributory factors, and possible therapeutic and prophylactic interventions.</p><h3>Aluminum Toxicity</h3><p class="First">ProSol contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum. However, with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment, the aluminum contained in ProSol may reach toxic levels. Preterm infants are at a greater risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.</p><p>Patients with renal impairment, including preterm infants, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.</p><h3>Risk of Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease</h3><p class="First">Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease (PNALD) has been reported in patients who receive parenteral nutrition for extended periods of time, especially preterm infants, and can present as cholestasis or steatohepatitis. The exact etiology is unknown and is likely multifactorial. If patients treated with parenteral nutrition solutions containing ProSol develop liver test abnormalities, consider discontinuation or dosage reduction.</p><h3>Electrolyte Imbalance and Fluid Overload</h3><p class="First">Patients with renal impairment, such as pre-renal azotemia, renal obstruction, and protein-losing nephropathy may be at increased risk of electrolyte and fluid volume imbalance. Patients with cardiac insufficiency and pulmonary congestion are susceptible to excess fluid accumulation. Use parenteral nutrition solutions containing ProSol with caution in patients with cardiac insufficiency or renal impairment. The dosage of parenteral nutrition may require adjustment with specific attention to fluid, protein, and electrolyte content in these patients.</p><p>Monitor renal function parameters. Patients developing signs of renal impairment should be assessed early by a clinician knowledgeable in renal disease in order to determine the appropriate parenteral nutrition dosage and other treatment options.</p><h3>Monitoring/Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Monitor fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count and coagulation parameters throughout treatment. If electrolyte levels are severely elevated, stop parenteral nutrition containing ProSol until levels have been corrected.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the prescribing information.</p><p>The following adverse reactions from voluntary reports or clinical studies have been reported with parenteral amino acid products. Because many of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Limited published data with injectable amino acids solutions, including ProSol in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. However, malnutrition in pregnant women is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Considerations].</span> Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with injectable amino acids solutions, including ProSol.</p><p>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4% and of miscarriage is 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk</span></p><p>Severe malnutrition in pregnant women is associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, congenital malformations and perinatal mortality. Parenteral nutrition should be considered if a pregnant woman’s nutritional requirements cannot be fulfilled by oral or enteral intake.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data available to assess the presence of injectable amino acids, including ProSol in human milk, the effects of ProSol on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of ProSol to a child during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for ProSol and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ProSol or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Neonates, especially premature infants with low birth weight, are at increased risk of developing hypo- or hyperglycemia and therefore need close monitoring during treatment with intravenous glucose solutions to ensure adequate glycemic control in order to avoid potential long term adverse effects <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].</span></p><p>Plasma electrolyte concentrations should be closely monitored in the pediatric patients who may have impaired ability to regulate fluids and electrolytes.</p><p>Hyperammonemia is of special significance in infants (birth to two years). This reaction appears to be related to a deficiency of the urea cycle amino acids of genetic or product origin. It is essential that blood ammonia be measured frequently in infants <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].</span></p><p>Because of immature renal function, preterm infants receiving prolonged parenteral nutrition treatment with ProSol may be at risk of aluminum toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].</span></p><p>Patients, including pediatric patients, may be at risk for PNALD <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies with ProSol have not been performed to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from other younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><p>In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or drug therapy.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with impaired renal function, parenteral nutrition solutions containing ProSol should be administered with caution. Frequent clinical evaluation and laboratory tests to monitor renal function such as serum electrolytes (especially phosphate and potassium) and fluid balance should be conducted <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.6)</span><span class="Italics">, and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with impaired liver function, parenteral nutrition solutions containing ProSol should be administered starting at the low end of the dosing range <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].</span> Frequent clinical evaluation and laboratory tests to monitor liver function such as bilirubin and liver function parameters should be conducted <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</span><span class="Italics">].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">An increased infusion rate of parenteral nutrition can cause hypervolemia, electrolyte disturbances, acidosis and/or azotemia, hyperglycemia, hyperosmolality <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.10)].</span></p><p>Severe hyperglycemia and severe dilutional hyponatremia, and their complications, can be fatal.</p><p>Discontinue infusion and institute appropriate corrective measures in the event of overhydration or solute overload during therapy, with particular attention to respiratory and cardiovascular systems.</p><p>For current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage, contact the National Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 or www.poison.org.</p><h2>ProSol Description</h2><p class="First">ProSol 20% (amino acids) injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, hypertonic solution of essential and nonessential amino acids supplied in a flexible container as a Pharmacy Bulk Package.
