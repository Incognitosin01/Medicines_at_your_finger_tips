Zanamivir will not treat the common cold.</p><p>Relenza should not be used in place of getting a yearly flu shot. The Centers for Disease Control recommends an annual flu shot to help protect you each year from new strains of influenza virus.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Some people using Relenza have had sudden unusual changes in mood or behavior, most often in children.
