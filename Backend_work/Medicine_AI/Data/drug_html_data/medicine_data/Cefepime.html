</ul><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><h3>Pneumonia</h3><p class="First">Cefepime for injection is indicated in the treatment of pneumonia (moderate to severe) caused by susceptible strains of <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span>, including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia, <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, <span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span>, or <span class="Italics">Enterobacter</span> species.</p><h3>Empiric Therapy for Febrile Neutropenic Patients</h3><p class="First">Cefepime for injection as monotherapy is indicated for empiric treatment of febrile neutropenic patients. In patients at high risk for severe infection (including patients with a history of recent bone marrow transplantation, with hypotension at presentation, with an underlying hematologic malignancy, or with severe or prolonged neutropenia), antimicrobial monotherapy may not be appropriate. Insufficient data exist to support the efficacy of Cefepime monotherapy in such patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Uncomplicated and Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (including pyelonephritis)</h3><p class="First">Cefepime for injection is indicated in the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections (including pyelonephritis) caused by susceptible isolates of <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span> or <span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span>, when the infection is severe, or caused by <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>, <span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span>, or <span class="Italics">Proteus mirabilis</span>, when the infection is mild to moderate, including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia with these bacteria.</p><h3>Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections</h3><p class="First">Cefepime for injection is indicated in the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) or <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span>.</p><h3>Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections (used in combination with metronidazole)</h3><p class="First">Cefepime for injection is indicated in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (used in combination with metronidazole) in adults caused by susceptible isolates of <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>, viridans group streptococci, <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, <span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span>, <span class="Italics">Enterobacter</span> species, or <span class="Italics">Bacteroides fragilis</span> <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Usage</h3><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefepime for injection and other antibacterial drugs, Cefepime for injection should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><h3>Dosage for Adults</h3><p class="First">The recommended adult dosages and routes of administration are outlined in Table 1 below for patients with creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min.

Exercise caution if this product is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients because cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs has been clearly documented and may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction to Cefepime for injection occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate supportive measures.</p><h3>Neurotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Serious adverse reactions have been reported including life-threatening or fatal occurrences of the following: encephalopathy (disturbance of consciousness including confusion, hallucinations, stupor, and coma), aphasia, myoclonus, seizures, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. Most cases occurred in patients with renal impairment who did not receive appropriate dosage adjustment. However, some cases of neurotoxicity occurred in patients receiving a dosage adjustment appropriate for their degree of renal impairment. In the majority of cases, symptoms of neurotoxicity were reversible and resolved after discontinuation of Cefepime and/or after hemodialysis. If neurotoxicity associated with Cefepime therapy occurs, discontinue Cefepime and institute appropriate supportive measures.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Cefepime for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing Cefepime for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><p>As with other antimicrobials, prolonged use of Cefepime for injection may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient’s condition is essential. Should superinfection occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.</p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Urinary Glucose</span></p><p>The administration of Cefepime may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine when using some methods (e.g. Clinitest™ tablets) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Coombs’ Tests</span></p><p>Positive direct Coombs’ tests have been reported during treatment with Cefepime for injection. In patients who develop hemolytic anemia, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy. Positive Coombs’ test may be observed in newborns whose mothers have received cephalosporin antibiotics before parturition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Prothrombin Time</span></p><p>Many cephalosporins, including Cefepime, have been associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk, and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in the Warnings and Precautions section and below:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>In clinical trials using multiple doses of Cefepime, 4,137 patients were treated with the recommended dosages of Cefepime (500 mg to 2 g intravenous every 12 hours). There were no deaths or permanent disabilities thought related to drug toxicity. Sixty-four (1.5%) patients discontinued medication due to adverse reactions. Thirty-three (51%) of these 64 patients who discontinued therapy did so because of rash. The percentage of Cefepime-treated patients who discontinued study drug because of drug-related adverse reactions was similar at daily doses of 500 mg, 1 g, and 2 g every 12 hours (0.8%, 1.1%, and 2%, respectively). However, the incidence of discontinuation due to rash increased with the higher recommended doses.</p><p>The following adverse reactions (Table 5) were identified in clinical trials conducted in North America (n=3,125 Cefepime-treated patients).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 5: Adverse Reactions in Cefepime Multiple-Dose Dosing Regimens Clinical Trials in North America</span></p><p class="First">Incidence equal to or greater than 1%</p><p class="First">Local adverse reactions (3%), including phlebitis (1.3%), pain and/or inflammation (0.6%)*; rash (1.1%)</p><p class="First">Incidence less than 1% but greater than 0.1%</p><p class="First">Colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis), diarrhea, erythema, fever, headache, nausea, oral moniliasis, pruritus, urticaria, vaginitis, vomiting, anemia</p><p><br/>
At the higher dose of 2 g every 8 hours, the incidence of adverse reactions was higher among the 795 patients who received this dose of Cefepime. They consisted of rash (4%), diarrhea (3%), nausea (2%), vomiting (1%), pruritus (1%), fever (1%), and headache (1%).</p><p>The following (Table 6) adverse laboratory changes, with Cefepime, were seen during clinical trials conducted in North America.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 6: Adverse Laboratory Changes in Cefepime Multiple-Dose Dosing Regimens Clinical Trials in North America</span></p><p class="First">Incidence equal to or greater than 1%<br/></p><p class="First">Positive Coombs’ test (without hemolysis) (16.2%); decreased phosphorus (2.8%); increased Alanine Transaminase (ALT) (2.8%), Aspartate Transaminase (AST) (2.4%), eosinophils (1.7%); abnormal PTT (1.6%), Prothrombin Time (PT) (1.4%)</p><p class="First">Incidence less than 1% but greater than 0.1%</p><p class="First">Increased alkaline phosphatase, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), calcium, creatinine, phosphorus, potassium, total bilirubin; decreased calcium*, hematocrit, neutrophils, platelets, White Blood Cells (WBC)</p><p>* Hypocalcemia was more common among elderly patients.

It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions be used.</p><h3>Aminoglycosides</h3><p class="First">Monitor renal function if aminoglycosides are to be administered with Cefepime for injection because of the increased potential of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibacterial drugs.</p><h3>Diuretics</h3><p class="First">Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other cephalosporins with potent diuretics such as furosemide. Monitor renal function when Cefepime is concomitantly administered with potent diuretics.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category B</span><br/>
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Cefepime use in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p>Cefepime was not teratogenic or embryocidal when administered during the period of organogenesis to rats at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (1.6 times the recommended maximum human dose calculated on a body surface area basis) or to mice at doses up to 1,200 mg/kg (approximately equal to the recommended maximum human dose calculated on a body surface area basis) or to rabbits at a dose level of 100 mg/kg (0.3 times the recommended maximum human dose calculated on a body surface area basis).</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">Cefepime has not been studied for use during labor and delivery. Treatment should only be given if clearly indicated.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Cefepime is excreted in human breast milk. Caution should be exercised when Cefepime is administered to a nursing woman <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Cefepime in the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections (including pyelonephritis), uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, pneumonia, and as empiric therapy for febrile neutropenic patients have been established in the age groups 2 months up to 16 years. Use of Cefepime for injection in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Cefepime in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data from pediatric trials <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 months have not been established. There are insufficient clinical data to support the use of Cefepime for injection in pediatric patients for the treatment of serious infections in the pediatric population where the suspected or proven pathogen is <span class="Italics">H. influenzae</span> type b. In those patients in whom meningeal seeding from a distant infection site or in whom meningitis is suspected or documented, an alternate agent with demonstrated clinical efficacy in this setting should be used.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the more than 6,400 adults treated with Cefepime for injection in clinical studies, 35% were 65 years or older while 16% were 75 years or older. When geriatric patients received the usual recommended adult dose, clinical efficacy and safety were comparable to clinical efficacy and safety in non-geriatric adult patients.</p><p>Serious adverse events have occurred in geriatric patients with renal insufficiency given unadjusted doses of Cefepime, including life-threatening or fatal occurrences of the following: encephalopathy, myoclonus, and seizures <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

The chemical name is 1-[[(6R,7R)-7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-glyoxylamido]-2-carboxy-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-3-yl]methyl]-1-methylpyrrolidinum chloride,7<span class="Sup">2</span>-(Z)-O-methyloxime), monohydrochloride, monohydrate, which corresponds to the following structural formula:</p><p>Cefepime hydrochloride is a white to pale yellow powder. Cefepime hydrochloride contains the equivalent of not less than 825 mcg and not more than 911 mcg of Cefepime (C<span class="Sub">19</span>H<span class="Sub">24</span>N<span class="Sub">6</span>O<span class="Sub">5</span>S<span class="Sub">2</span>) per mg, calculated on an anhydrous basis. It is highly soluble in water.</p><p>Cefepime for Injection, USP is supplied for intramuscular or intravenous administration in strengths equivalent to 1 g, and 2 g of Cefepime. Cefepime for Injection, USP is a sterile, dry mixture of Cefepime hydrochloride and L-arginine. The L-arginine, at an approximate concentration of 707 mg/g of Cefepime, is added to control the pH of the constituted solution at 4 to 6. Freshly constituted solutions of Cefepime for Injection, USP will range in color from pale yellow to amber.</p><h2>Cefepime - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Cefepime is a cephalosporin antibacterial drug <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Similar to other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the time that the unbound plasma concentration of Cefepime exceeds the MIC of the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal models of infection. However, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics relationship for Cefepime has not been evaluated in patients.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Pharmacokinetic parameters for Cefepime in healthy adult male volunteers (n=9) following single 30‑minute infusions (IV) of Cefepime 500 mg, 1 g, and 2 g are summarized in Table 7. Elimination of Cefepime is principally via renal excretion with an average (±SD) half-life of 2 (±0.3) hours and total body clearance of 120 (±8) mL/min in healthy volunteers.

Data suggest that Cefepime does cross the inflamed blood-brain barrier.

Urinary recovery of unchanged Cefepime accounts for approximately 85% of the administered dose. Less than 1% of the administered dose is recovered from urine as NMP, 6.8% as NMP-N-oxide, and 2.5% as an epimer of Cefepime. Because renal excretion is a significant pathway of elimination, patients with renal dysfunction and patients undergoing hemodialysis require dosage adjustment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal impairment</span></span></p><p>Cefepime pharmacokinetics have been investigated in patients with various degrees of renal impairment (n=30).

The urinary recovery of unchanged Cefepime was 60.4 (±30.4)% of the administered dose, and the average renal clearance was 2 (±1.1) mL/min/kg. There were no significant effects of age or gender (25 male vs. 17 female) on total body clearance or volume of distribution, corrected for body weight.

Insufficient data exist to support the efficacy of Cefepime monotherapy in patients at high risk for severe infection (including patients with a history of recent bone marrow transplantation, with hypotension at presentation, with an underlying hematologic malignancy, or with severe or prolonged neutropenia). No data are available in patients with septic shock.</p><h3>Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections</h3><p class="First">Patients hospitalized with complicated intra-abdominal infections participated in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing the combination of Cefepime (2 g every 12 hours) plus intravenous metronidazole (500 mg every 6 hours) versus imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg every 6 hours) for a maximum duration of 14 days of therapy. The study was designed to demonstrate equivalence of the two therapies. The primary analyses were conducted on the population consisting of those with a surgically confirmed complicated infection, at least one pathogen isolated pretreatment, at least 5 days of treatment, and a 4 to 6 week follow-up assessment for cured patients. Subjects in the imipenem/cilastatin arm had higher APACHE II scores at baseline.  The treatment groups were otherwise  generally comparable with regard to their pretreatment characteristics. The overall clinical cure rate among the primary analysis patients was 81% (51 cured/63 evaluable patients) in the Cefepime plus metronidazole group and 66% (62/94) in the imipenem/cilastatin group. The observed differences in efficacy may have been due to a greater proportion of patients with high APACHE II scores in the imipenem/cilastatin group.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">How Supplied</span></p><p>Cefepime for Injection, USP is supplied as follows:</p><p>Cefepime for Injection, USP in the dry state, is a white to pale yellow powder.
