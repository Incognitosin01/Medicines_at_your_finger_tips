This allows your blood vessels to relax and your heart to beat more slowly and easily.</p><p>The Catapres brand of clonidine is used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). The Kapvay brand of clonidine is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The Duraclon brand of clonidine is an intravenous (IV) form of clonidine used to treat severe pain in cancer patients.</p><p>Catapres may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before you take Catapres, tell your doctor if you have heart disease, severe coronary artery disease, a heart rhythm disorder, slow heartbeats, low blood pressure, a history of heart attack or stroke, kidney disease, or if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a Catapres TTS transdermal skin patch.</p><p>Catapres may impair your thinking or reactions. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be alert.</p><p>Do not take two forms of clonidine at the same time.</p><p>If you are being treated for high blood pressure, keep using this medication even if you feel well. High blood pressure often has no symptoms. You may need to use blood pressure medication for the rest of your life.</p><p>Do not stop taking Catapres without speaking to your doctor. Suddenly stopping Catapres can lead to a severe rise in blood pressure and symptoms such as nervousness, restlessness, headaches, and tremors or shaking.
