Lamivudine and zidovudine is not a cure for HIV or AIDS.</p><p>Lamivudine and zidovudine may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not</b> take  lamivudine and zidovudine if you have ever had an allergic reaction to any medicine that contains lamivudine or zidovudine.</p><p>Zidovudine can weaken your immune system and cause signs of infection (fever, mouth sores, skin sores, flu symptoms, pale skin). Your blood will need to be tested often. Long-term use of zidovudine can cause muscle weakness, or loss of muscle tissue similar to "wasting syndrome" caused by HIV.</p><p>You may develop <b>lactic acidosis,</b> a dangerous build-up of lactic acid in your blood. Call your doctor or get emergency medical help if you have unusual muscle pain, trouble breathing, stomach pain, dizziness, feeling cold, or feeling very weak or tired.</p><p>If you've ever had hepatitis B, it may become active or get worse after you stop using this medicine. You may need frequent liver function tests for several months.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not take this medicine if you are allergic to lamivudine. <b>Do not take Combivir with any other medicine that contains lamivudine, zidovudine, or emtricitabine.</b> This includes Atripla, Biktarvy, Cimduo, Combivir, Complera, Descovy, Emtriva, Epzicom, Genvoya, Odefsey, Retrovir, Stribild, Symfi, Triumeq, Trizivir, and Truvada.</p><p><b>Lamivudine and zidovudine can also cause severe or fatal liver problems.</b> Tell your doctor if you have liver disease, especially hepatitis B.</p><p><b>Lamivudine and zidovudine should not be used to treat HIV in adolescents weighing less than 66 pounds.</b></p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

</ul><p>kidney disease;</p><p>pancreas disorder (especially in a child taking this medicine); or</p><p>if you take ribavirin to treat hepatitis C.</p><p>You may develop <b>lactic acidosis,</b> a dangerous build-up of lactic acid in your blood. This may be more likely if you have other medical conditions, if you've taken HIV medication for a long time, or if you are a woman. Ask your doctor about your risk.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, and use your medications properly to control your infection. HIV can be passed to your baby if the virus is not controlled during pregnancy. Your name may be listed on a registry to track any effects of antiviral medicine on the baby.</p><p>Women with HIV or AIDS should not breast-feed a baby. Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk.</p><h2>How should I take lamivudine and zidovudine?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>You may take  lamivudine and zidovudine with or without food.</p><p>Use all HIV medications as directed and read all medication guides you receive. Do not change your dose or dosing schedule without your doctor's advice. Every person with HIV should remain under the care of a doctor.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>If you've ever had hepatitis B, this virus may become active or get worse in the months after you stop using lamivudine and zidovudine. You may need frequent liver function tests while using this medicine and for several months after your last dose.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking lamivudine and zidovudine?</h2><p>Avoid taking other medications that contain an ingredient called sorbitol, often used as a sweetener in liquid medicines. Ask your pharmacist if you are not sure a medicine contains this ingredient.</p><p>Using  lamivudine and zidovudine will not prevent your disease from spreading. Do not have unprotected sex or share razors or toothbrushes. Talk with your doctor about safe ways to prevent HIV transmission during sex.
