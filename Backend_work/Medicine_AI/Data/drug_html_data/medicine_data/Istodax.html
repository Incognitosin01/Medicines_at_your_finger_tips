It is usually given after other medicines have been tried without successful treatment of symptoms.</p><p>Istodax may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before you receive Istodax, tell your doctor if you have an electrolyte imbalance, a personal or family history of "Long QT syndrome," heart disease, kidney disease, or liver disease.</p><p>Do not receive Istodax if you are pregnant. It could harm the unborn baby. Use effective birth control, and tell your doctor if you become pregnant during treatment. Hormonal forms of contraception (such as birth control pills, injections, implants, skin patches, and vaginal rings) may not be effective enough to prevent pregnancy during your treatment. Ask your doctor about using a non-hormone method of birth control (such as a condom, diaphragm, spermicide) to prevent pregnancy while taking Istodax.</p><h2>Before receiving Istodax</h2><p>You should not use Istodax if you are allergic to romidepsin.</p><p>To make sure Istodax is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
