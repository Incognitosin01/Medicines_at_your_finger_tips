</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Dorzolamide and Timolol Ophthalmic Solution</h2><p class="First">  Dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open -angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are insufficiently responsive to bet a-blockers (failed to achieve target IOP determined after multiple measurements over time). The IOP-lowering of dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution ad ministered twice a day was slightly less than that seen with the concomitant administration of 0.5% ti molol administered twice a day and 2% dorzola mide administered three times a day <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><h2>Dorzolamide and Timolol Ophthalmic Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The dose is one drop of dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in the affected eye(s) two times daily.</p><p>If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least five minutes apart <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Ophthalmic solution containing dorzolamide 20 mg/mL (2%) equivalent to 22.26 mg/mL of dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol 5 mg/mL (0.5%) equivalent to 6.83 mg/mL of timolol maleate.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Asthma, COPD</h3><p class="First">Dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in patients with bronchial asthma, a histo ry of bronchial asthma, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> .</p><h3>Sinus Bradycardia, AV Block, Cardiac Failure, Cardiogenic Shock</h3><p class="First">Dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in patients with sinus bradycardia, second or third degree atrioventricular block, overt cardiac failure, and cardiogenic shock <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span> .</p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span> .</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Potentiation of Respiratory Reactions Including Asthma</h3><p class="First">Dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution contains timolol maleate, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent; and although administered topically, is absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure, have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1)].</span></p><h3>Cardiac Failure</h3><p class="First">Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure.</p><p>In patients without a history of cardiac failure continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.2)].</span></p><h3>Sulfonamide Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution contains dorzolamide, a sulfonamide; and although administered topically, it is absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to sulfonamides may occur with topical administration of dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. Fatalities have occurred, although rarely, due to severe reactions to sulfonamides including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias. Sensitization may recur when a sulfonamide is readministered irrespective of the route of administration. If signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur, discontinue the use of this preparation <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.3)].</span></p><h3>Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</h3><p class="First">Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1)].</span></p><h3>Increased Reactivity to Allergens</h3><p class="First">While taking beta-blockers, patients with a histo ry of atopy or a histo ry of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions.</p><h3>Potentiation of Muscle Weakness</h3><p class="First">Beta -adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain m yasthenic s y mptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or m yasthenic s y mp toms.</p><h3>Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus</h3><p class="First">Beta -adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypogl ycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and s y mptoms of acute hypoglyce mia.</p><h3>Masking of Thyrotoxicosis</h3><p class="First">Beta -adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tach ycardia) of h y perth yroidism. Patients suspected of developing th yrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrene rgic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm.</p><h3>Renal and Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dorzolamide has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt;30 mL / min). Because dorzolamide and its metabolite are excreted predominantly by the kidney, dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is not recommended in such patients.</p><p>Dorzolamide has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and should therefore be used with caution in such patients.</p><h3>Impairment of Beta-Adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery</h3><p class="First">The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta -adrenergic receptor blocking agents.</p><p>If necessary during surgery, the effe cts of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists.</p><h3>Corneal Endothelium</h3><p class="First">Carbonic anhydrase activity has been observed in both the cytoplasm and around the plasma m e m branes of the corneal endothelium. There is an increased potential for developing corneal edema in patients with low endothelial cell counts. Caution should be used when prescribing dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution to this group of patients.</p><h3>Bacterial Keratitis</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution was evaluated in 1,035 patients with elevated intraocular pressure treated for open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension for up to 15 months. Approximately 5% of all patients discontinued therapy because of adverse reactions.</p><p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring in up to 30% of patients were taste perversion (bitter, sour, or unusual taste) or ocular burning and/or stinging. The following adverse reactions were reported in 5 to 15% of patients: conjunctival hyperemia, blurred vision, superficial punctate keratitis or eye itching.</p><p>The following adverse reactions were reported in 1 to 5% of patients: abdominal pain, back pain, blepharitis, bronchitis, cloudy vision, conjunctival discharge, conjunctival edema, conjunctival follicles, conjunctival injection, conjunctivitis, corneal erosion, corneal staining, cortical lens opacity, cough, dizziness, dryness of eyes, dyspepsia, eye debris, eye discharge, eye pain, eye tearing, eyelid edema, eyelid erythema, eyelid exudate/scales, eyelid pain or discomfort, foreign body sensation, glaucomatous cupping, headache, hypertension, influenza, lens nucleus coloration, lens opacity, nausea, nuclear lens opacity, pharyngitis, post-subcapsular cataract, sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, urinary tract infection, visual field defect, vitreous detachment.</p><p>Other adverse reactions that have been reported with the individual components are listed below:</p><p><span class="Bold">Dorzolamide 2%</span></p><p>Angioedema, asthenia/fatigue, bronchospasm, contact dermatitis, epistaxis, eyelid crusting, ocular discomfort, photophobia, signs and symptoms of ocular allergic reaction, transient myopia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Timolol (ocular administration)</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole:</span> Asthenia/fatigue; <span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> Arrhythmia, syncope, cerebral ischemia, worsening of angina pectoris, palpitation, cardiac arrest, pulmonary edema, edema, claudication, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and cold hands and feet; <span class="Italics">Digestive:</span> Anorexia, abdominal pain; <span class="Italics">Immunologic:</span> Systemic lupus erythematosus; <span class="Italics">Nervous System/Psychiatric:</span> Increase in signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis, somnolence, insomnia, nightmares, behavioral changes and psychic disturbances including confusion, hallucinations, anxiety, disorientation, nervousness, and memory loss; <span class="Italics">Skin:</span>Alopecia, psoriasiform rash or exacerbation of psoriasis; <span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity:</span> Signs and symptoms of systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, and localized and generalized rash; <span class="Italics">Respiratory:</span> Bronchospasm (predominantly in patients with pre-existing bronchospastic disease); <span class="Italics">Endocrine:</span> Masked symptoms of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients; <span class="Italics">Special Senses:</span>Ptosis, decreased corneal sensitivity, cystoid macular edema, visual disturbances including refractive changes and diplopia, pseudopemphigoid, and tinnitus; <span class="Italics">Urogenital:</span> Retroperitoneal fibrosis, decreased libido, impotence, and Peyronie’s disease; <span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal</span>: Myalgia.</p><h3>Post-Marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not alwa ys possible to reliably estimate their frequen cy or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: bradycardia, cardiac failure, cerebral vascular accident, chest pain, choroidal detachment following filtration surge ry, depression, diarrhea, d ry mouth, d yspnea, heart block, hypotension, iridocyclitis, m yocardial infar ction, nasal congestion, Steven s-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, paresthesia, photophobia, respirato ry failure, skin rashes, urolithiasis, and vomiting.</p><p><span class="Bold">Timolol (oral administration)</span></p><p>The following additional adverse reactions have been report ed in clinical experience with ORAL ti molol maleate or other ORAL beta-blocking agents and may be considered potential effects of ophthalmic timolol maleate: <span class="Italics">Allergic:</span> E rythe matous rash, fever combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm with respira t ory distress; <span class="Italics">Body as a Whole:</span> Extremity pain, decreased exercise tolerance, weight loss; <span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> Worsening of arterial insufficiency, vasodilatation; <span class="Italics">Digestive:</span> Gastrointestinal pain, hepatomegaly, mesenteric arterial thrombosis, ischemic colitis; <span class="Italics">Hematologic:</span> Nonthromboc ytopenic purpura; thrombocytopenic purpura, agranulocytosis; <span class="Italics">Endocrine:</span> H yperglycemia, hypoglycemia; <span class="Italics">Skin:</span> Pruritus, skin irritation, increased pigmentation, sweating; <span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> Arthralgia; <span class="Italics">Nervous System/Psychiatric:</span> Vertigo, local weakness, diminished concentration, reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia, an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation for time and place, e motional lability, slightly clouded sensorium, and decreased performance on neurops ychometrics; <span class="Italics">Respiratory:</span> Rales, bronchial obstruction; <span class="Italics">Urogenital:</span> Urination difficulties.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Oral Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">There is a potential for an additive effect on the known s ystemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution. The concomitant ad ministration of dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not recommended.</p><h3>High-Dose Salicylate Therapy</h3><p class="First">Although acid-base and electrolyte distu rbances were not reported in the clinical trials with dorzolamide hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, these disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anh ydrase inhibitors and have, in some instances, resulted in drug interactions (e.g., toxicity as sociated with high-dose salicylate therapy). Therefore, the potential for such drug interactions should be considered in patients receiving dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution.</p><h3>Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents</h3><p class="First">Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally and dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended.</p><h3>Calcium Antagonists</h3><p class="First">Caution should be used in the coadministration of bet a-adrenergic blocking agents, such as dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac fu nction, coadministration should be avoided.</p><h3>Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs</h3><p class="First">Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta-blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural h ypotension.</p><h3>Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calc ium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time.</p><h3>CYP2D6 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Potentiated systemic beta -blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol.</p><h3>Clonidine</h3><p class="First">Oral beta-adrenergic blocking agents may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. There have been no reports of exacerbation of rebound hypertension with ophthalmic ti molol maleate.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effect s</span>. Developmental toxicity studies with dorzolamide h ydrochloride in rabbits at oral doses of ≥2.5 mg/kg/day (37 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) revealed malformations of the vertebral bodies. These malformations occurred at doses that caused metabolic acidosis with decreased body weight gain in dams and decreased fetal weights. No treatment-related malformations were seen at 1 mg/kg/day (15 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose).</p><p>Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats, and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg / kg/day (7,000 ti mes the s ystemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose) de monstrated no evidence of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at t his dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg / kg/day (142,000 times the s ystemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an incre ased number of fetal resorptions.</p><p>Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses of 14,000 times the s ystemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose, in this case without apparent maternotoxicity.</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether dorzolamide is excreted in human milk. Timolol maleate has been detected in human milk following oral and ophthalmic drug administration. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of dorzolamide hydrochloride ophthalmic solution and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution have been established when administered individually in pediatric patients aged 2 y ears and older. Use of these drug products in these children is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in children and adults. Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">S y mptoms consistent with s ystemic administration of beta-blockers or carbonic anhydrase inhibito rs may occur, including electrolyte imbalance, development of an acidotic state, dizziness, headache, shortness of breath, brad ycardia, bronchospasm, cardiac arrest and possible central nervous s ystem effects. Serum electrolyte levels (particularly potassium) and blood pH levels should be monitored. <span class="Italics">[See Adverse Reactions (6).]</span></p><p>A study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol did not dialyze readily.</p><h2>Dorzolamide and Timolol Ophthalmic Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, USP is the combination of a topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and a topical beta -adrenergic receptor blocking agent.</p><p>Dorzolamide hydrochloride is described chemically as: (4 <span class="Italics">S-tran s</span>)-4 -(ethylamino )-5,6-di h yd ro-6- meth yl -4 <span class="Italics">H</span>-thieno[2,3- <span class="Italics">b</span>]thiopyran -2 -sulfonamide 7,7-dioxide mo noh ydrochloride.

It is a white, odorless, cr ystalline powder which is soluble in water, methanol, and alcohol. Timolol maleate is stable at room temperature.</p><p>Dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, USP is supplied as a sterile, isotonic, buffered, clear, colorless to nearly colorless and slightly viscous solution. The pH of the solution is approximately 5.65, and the osmolarity is 242 to 323 mOsM. Each mL of dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, USP contains 20 mg dorzolamide (22.26 mg of dorzolamide hydrochloride USP) and 5 mg timolol (6.83 mg timolol maleate USP). Inactive ingredients are Mannitol, Hydroxyethyl cellulose, Sodium hydroxide, Tri Sodium citrate Dihydrate, and water for injection. Benzalkonium chloride 0.0075% is added as a preservative.</p><h2>Dorzolamide and Timolol Ophthalmic Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is comprised of two components: dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate. Each of these two components decreases elevated intraocular pressure, whether or not associated with glaucoma, by reducing aqueous humor secretion. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous field loss and optic nerve damage.</p><p>Dorzolamide hydrochloride is an inhibitor of human carbonic anhydrase II. Inhibition of carbonic an h ydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. Timolol maleate is a beta1 and bet a2 (non-selective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent that does not have significant intrinsic s y mpathomimetic, direct m yocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane- stabilizing) activity. The combined effect of these two agents administered as dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily results in additional intraocular pressure reduction compared to either component administered alone, but the reduction is not as much as when dorzolamide administered three times daily and timolol twice daily are ad ministered concomitantly. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14).]</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Dorzolamide Hydrochloride</span></p><p>W hen topically applied, dorzolamide reaches the s y stemic circulation. To assess the potential for s ystemic carbonic anhydrase inhibition following topical administration, drug and metabolite concentrations in RBCs and plasma and carbonic anhydrase inhibition in RBCs were measured. Dorzolamide accumulates in RBCs during chronic dosing as a result of binding to CA-II. The parent drug forms a single N-desethyl metabolite, which inhibits CA-II less potently than the parent drug but also inhibits CA-I. The metabolite also accumulates in RBCs where it binds primarily to C A-I. Plasma concentrations of dorzolamide and metabolite are generally below the assay limit of quantitation (15nM). Dorzolamide binds moderately to plasma proteins (approximately 33%).</p><p>Dorzolamide is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine; the metabolite also is excreted in urine. After dosing is stopped, dorzolamide washes out of RBCs nonlinearly, resulting in a rapid decline of drug concentration initially, followed by a slower elimination phase with a hal f-life of about four months.</p><p>To simulate the systemic exposure after long-term topical ocular administration, dorzolamide was given orally to eight healthy subjects for up to 20 weeks. The oral dose of 2 mg twice daily closely approximates the amount of drug delivered by topical ocular administration of dorzolamide 2% three ti mes daily. Steady state was reached within 8 wee ks. The inhibition of CA-II and total carbonic anh ydrase activities was below the degree of inhibition anticipated to be necessa ry for a pharmacological effect on renal function and respiration in healthy individuals.</p><p><span class="Italics">Timolol Maleate</span></p><p>In a study of plasma d rug concentrations in six subjects, the systemic exposure to timolol was determined following twice daily topical administration of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5%. The mean peak plasma concentration following morning dosing was 0.46 ng/mL.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis &amp; Mutagenesis &amp; Impairment Of Fertility</h3><p class="First">In a two - y ear study of dorzolamide hydrochloride administered orally to male and female Spragu e- Dawley rats, urinary bladder papillomas were seen in male rats in the highest dosa ge group of 20 mg / kg/day (250 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose). Papillomas were not seen in rats given oral doses equivalent to approximately 12 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose. No treatment-related tumors were seen in a 21- month stu dy in female and male mice given oral doses up to 75 mg / kg/day (~900 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose).</p><p>The increased incidence of urina ry bladder papillomas seen in the high -dose male rats is a clas s- effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in rats. Rats are particularly prone to developing papillomas in response to foreign bodies, compounds causing cr ystalluria, and diverse sodium salts.</p><p>No changes in bladder urothelium were seen in dogs given oral dorzolamide hydrochloride for one y ear at 2 mg/kg/day (25 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) or monke ys dosed topically to the eye at 0.4 mg/kg/day (~5 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) for one year.</p><p>In a two - y ear study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromoc ytomas in male rats administered 300 mg / kg/day (approximately 42,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose). Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 14,000 times the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose.</p><p>In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day, (approximately 71,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose), but not at 5 or 50 mg / kg/day (approximately 700 or 7,000, respectively, times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which pos t- mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/d a y.</p><p>The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg / kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful chang es in serum prolactin.</p><p>The following tests for mutagenic potential were negative for dorzolamide: (1) <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> ( mouse) c ytogenetic assay; (2) <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration assay; (3) alkaline elution assay; (4) V-79 assay; and (5) Ames test.</p><p>T i molol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of ti molol e mpl oyed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assa ys with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test.</p><p>Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with either timolol maleate or dorzolamide hydrochloride de monstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the s ystemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Clinical studies of 3 to 15 months duration were conducted to compare the IOP -lowering effect over the course of the day of dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily (dosed morning and bedtime) to individually and concomitantly administered 0.5% timolol twice daily and 2% dorzola mide twice and three times daily. The IOP-lowering effect of dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice daily was greater (1 to 3 mmHg) than that of monotherapy with either 2% dorzolamide three times daily or 0.5% timolol twice daily.
