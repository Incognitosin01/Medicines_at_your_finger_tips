It works by preventing the breakdown of a chemical that is important for the processes of memory, thinking, and reasoning. People with dementia usually have lower levels of this chemical.</p><p>Rivastigmine transdermal may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use  rivastigmine transdermal if you have ever had severe redness, itching, or skin irritation where a rivastigmine transdermal skin patch was worn.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use this medicine if you are allergic to rivastigmine or similar medicines, such as felbamate, meprobamate, or carisoprodol.</p><p>You should not use this medicine if you have ever had severe redness, itching, or skin irritation where a rivastigmine transdermal skin patch was worn.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2>How should I use rivastigmine transdermal?</h2><p>Do not take rivastigmine <b>capsules or oral liquid</b> at the same time you are wearing the <b>skin patch</b>.</p><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Do not take by mouth. The transdermal patch is for use only on the skin.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Apply the patch to clean, dry, and hairless skin. Do not use on broken or irritated skin. Press the patch firmly into place for about 30 seconds to make sure it sticks. You may leave the patch on while bathing, showering, or swimming.</p><p>Remove the skin patch after 24 hours and replace it with a new one. Always remove an old patch before putting on a new one.</p><p><b>Do not wear more than one rivastigmine patch at a time.</b> Using extra skin patches will not make the medication more effective.</p><p>If a patch falls off, apply a new patch and wear it for the rest of the day. Change the patch at your usual time the next day.</p><p>Choose a different place on your body to wear the patch each time you put on a new one. Do not use the same skin area twice within 14 days.</p><p>Always wash your hands after removing the patch.</p><p>After removing a patch, fold it in half so it sticks together and throw it away in a place where children or pets cannot get to it. A used skin patch could be fatal to a child or pet who accidentally chews on the patch. <b>Seek emergency medical attention if this happens.</b></p><p>It may take up to 4 weeks before your symptoms improve. For best results, keep using the patches as directed.</p><p>If you need surgery, tell your surgeon you currently use  rivastigmine transdermal.</p><p>If you stop using rivastigmine for any reason, do not restart the medicine without talking to your doctor first. You may need to start with a lower dose.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep each patch in its foil pouch until you are ready to use it.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>If you forget to change the skin patch, remove it and apply a new one as soon as you remember. Do not wear extra patches to make up a missed dose.</p><p><b>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss more than 3 doses of rivastigmine.</b></p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using rivastigmine transdermal?</h2><p>Avoid placing the patch where it will be rubbed by tight clothing.</p><p>Avoid touching your eyes after handling a skin patch.</p><p>Do not use lotion, oil, or powder on the skin where you plan to apply a skin patch. The patch may not stick to the skin.</p><p>Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how  rivastigmine transdermal will affect you. Your reactions could be impaired.</p><p>Avoid applying heat to the skin where the patch is worn, because it may increase the amount of medicine your body absorbs. Heat sources include hot tubs, heating pads, heat lamps, saunas, heated water beds, and direct sunlight.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Rivastigmine transdermal side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
