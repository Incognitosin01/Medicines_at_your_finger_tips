This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use. </p><p>Piroxicam is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. </p><p>NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Anaphylactoid reactions: Even in patients without prior exposure anaphylactoid reactions may occur; patients with "aspirin triad" (bronchial asthma, aspirin intolerance, rhinitis) may be at increased risk. Contraindicated use in patients who experience bronchospasm, asthma, rhinitis, or urticaria with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or aspirin therapy.</p><p>• Cardiovascular events:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious (and potentially fatal) adverse cardiovascular thrombotic events, including MI and stroke. Risk may occur early during treatment and may increase with duration of use.</b> Relative risk appears to be similar in those with and without known cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease; however, absolute incidence of cardiovascular events (which may occur early during treatment) was higher in patients with known cardiovascular disease or risk factors. New-onset hypertension or exacerbation of hypertension may occur (NSAIDs may also impair response to ACE inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics); may contribute to cardiovascular events; monitor blood pressure; use with caution in patients with hypertension. May cause sodium and fluid retention, use with caution in patients with edema. Avoid use in patients with heart failure (ACCF/AHA [Yancy 2013]). Avoid use in patients with recent MI unless benefits outweigh risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce risk of cardiovascular events; alternate therapies should be considered for patients at high risk.</p><p>• CNS effects: May cause drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, and other neurologic effects which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks which require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving). Discontinue use with blurred or diminished vision and perform ophthalmologic exam. Periodically evaluate vision in all patients receiving long term therapy.</p><p>• GI events:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious GI inflammation, ulceration, bleeding, and perforation (may be fatal); elderly patients and patients with history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events. These events may occur at any time during therapy and without warning.</b> Avoid use in patients with active GI bleeding. In patients with a history of acute lower GI bleeding, avoid use of non-aspirin NSAIDs, especially if due to angioectasia or diverticulosis (Strate 2016). Use caution with a history of GI ulcers, concurrent therapy known to increase the risk of GI bleeding (eg, aspirin, anticoagulants and/or corticosteroids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), smoking, use of alcohol, or in elderly or debilitated patients. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce risk of GI adverse events; alternate therapies should be considered for patients at high risk. When used concomitantly with aspirin, a substantial increase in the risk of GI complications (eg, ulcer) occurs; concomitant gastroprotective therapy (eg, proton pump inhibitors) is recommended (Bhatt 2008).</p><p>• Hematologic effects: Platelet adhesion and aggregation may be decreased; may prolong bleeding time; patients with coagulation disorders or who are receiving anticoagulants should be monitored closely. Anemia may occur; patients on long-term NSAID therapy should be monitored for anemia. Rarely, NSAID use has been associated with potentially severe blood dyscrasias (eg, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia).</p><p>• Hyperkalemia: NSAID use may increase the risk of hyperkalemia, particularly in the elderly, diabetics, renal disease, and with concomitant use of other agents capable of inducing hyperkalemia (eg, ACE-inhibitors). Monitor potassium closely.</p><p>• Serum sickness: A serum sickness-like reaction can rarely occur; watch for arthralgias, pruritus, fever, fatigue, and rash.</p><p>• Skin reactions: NSAIDs may cause serious skin adverse events including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis; discontinue use at first sign of skin rash or hypersensitivity.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Asthma: Do not administer to patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma; severe bronchospasm may occur. Use caution in patients with other forms of asthma.</p><p>• Bariatric surgery: Gastric ulceration: Avoid chronic use of oral nonselective NSAIDs after bariatric surgery; development of anastomotic ulcerations/perforations may occur (Bhangu 2014; Mechanick 2013). Short-term use of celecoxib or IV ketorolac are recommended as part of a multimodal pain management strategy for postoperative pain (Chou 2016; Horsley 2019; Thorell 2016).</p><p>• Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Use is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.</b> Risk of MI and stroke may be increased with use following CABG surgery.</p><p>• Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Clinical or population-based data regarding the risks of NSAIDs in the setting of COVID-19 are limited (FDA Safety Communication 2020; Kim 2020). Some experts recommend the use of acetaminophen as the preferred antipyretic agent, when possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, to use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration (EMA 2020; Kim 2020). In general, for patients already taking an NSAID for a comorbid condition, it is recommended to continue the NSAID as directed by their health care provider (EMA 2020; NIH 2020; WHO 2020).</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with decreased hepatic function. Closely monitor patients with any abnormal LFT. Rare (sometimes fatal), severe hepatic reactions (eg, fulminant hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure) have occurred with NSAID use; discontinue if signs or symptoms of liver disease develop, if systemic manifestations occur, or with persistent or worsening abnormal hepatic function tests.</p><p>• Hypertension: Use with caution; may cause new-onset hypertension or worsening of existing hypertension. Monitor blood pressure closely with initiation and during piroxicam therapy.</p><p>• Renal impairment: NSAID use may compromise existing renal function; dose-dependent decreases in prostaglandin synthesis may result from NSAID use, reducing renal blood flow which may cause renal decompensation. Patients with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, and ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and the elderly are at greater risk of renal toxicity. Rehydrate patient before starting therapy; monitor renal function closely. Avoid use in patients with advanced renal disease; discontinue use with persistent or worsening abnormal renal function tests. Long-term NSAID use may result in renal papillary necrosis.</p><p><b><i>Special populations: </i></b></p><p>• Poor CYP2C9 metabolizers: Use with caution; hepatic metabolism may be reduced resulting in elevated serum concentrations.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Surgical/dental procedures: Withhold for at least 4 to 6 half-lives prior to surgical or dental procedures.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Occult blood loss, hemoglobin, hematocrit, electrolytes, and periodic renal and hepatic function tests; periodic ophthalmologic exams with chronic use</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>The chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in women of reproductive age may be associated with infertility. Rupture of ovarian follicles may be delayed or prevented; some studies have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider discontinuing use in women having difficulty conceiving or those undergoing investigation of fertility.</p><p>Use of NSAIDs may be continued in males with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who are planning to father a child (ACR [Sammaritano 2020]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) close to conception may be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage (Bermas 2014; Bloor 2013).</p><p>Birth defects have been observed following in utero NSAID exposure in some studies; however, data is conflicting (Bloor 2013). Nonteratogenic effects, including prenatal constriction of the ductus arteriosus, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, oligohydramnios, necrotizing enterocolitis, renal dysfunction or failure, and intracranial hemorrhage, have been observed in the fetus/neonate following in utero NSAID exposure. In addition, nonclosure of the ductus arteriosus postnatally may occur and be resistant to medical management (Bermas 2014; Bloor 2013). Because NSAIDs may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus, product labeling for piroxicam specifically states use should be avoided starting at 30 weeks' gestation.</p><p>Use of NSAIDs may be considered during the first two trimesters of pregnancy for the treatment of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (ACR [Sammaritano 2020]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat arthritis.</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
