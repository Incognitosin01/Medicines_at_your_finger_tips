Bacteria eventually lyse due to ongoing activity of cell wall autolytic enzymes (autolysins and murein hydrolases) while cell wall assembly is arrested.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Ticarcillin is distributed into tissue, interstitial fluid, pleural fluid, and bile; low concentrations of ticarcillin distribute into the CSF but increase when meninges are inflamed; V<sub>dss</sub>:</p><p>Ticarcillin: 0.22 L/kg </p><p>Clavulanic acid: 0.4 L/kg </p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Clavulanic acid is metabolized hepatically </p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Children: Ticarcillin: Urine (71%  50% as unchanged drug over 4 hour); Clavulanic acid: Urine (50% as unchanged drug over 4 hours)</p><p>Adults: Ticarcillin: Urine (60% to 70% as unchanged drug); Clavulanic acid: Urine (35% to 45% as unchanged drug)</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Immediately following completion of 30-minute infusion </p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Neonates: Ticarcillin: 4.4 hours; Clavulanic acid: 1.9 hours</p><p>Children (1 month to 9.3 years): Ticarcillin: 66 minutes; Clavulanic acid: 54 minutes</p><p>Adults: Ticarcillin: 66 to 72 minutes; 13 hours (in patients with renal failure); Clavulanic acid: 66 to 90 minutes; clavulanic acid does not affect the clearance of ticarcillin</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>Ticarcillin: ~45%; Clavulanic acid: ~25% </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Bone and joint infections:</b> Treatment of bone and joint infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing isolates of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. </p><p><b>Endometritis:</b> Treatment of endometritis caused by beta-lactamase-producing isolates of <i>Prevotella melaninogenicus</i>, <i>Enterobacter</i> species (including <i>E. cloacae</i>), <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>S. aureus</i>, or <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>. </p><p><b>Lower respiratory tract infections:</b> Treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing isolates of <i>S. aureus</i>, <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>, or <i>Klebsiella</i> species.  </p><p><b>Peritonitis:</b> Treatment of peritonitis caused by beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  <i>E. coli</i>, <i>K. pneumonia</i>, or <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> group. </p><p><b>Septicemia:</b> Treatment of septicemia (including bacteremia) caused by beta-lactamase-producing isolates of <i>Klebsiella</i> species, <i>E. coli</i>, <i>S. aureus</i>, or <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (or other <i>Pseudomonas</i> species). </p><p><b>Skin and skin structure infections:</b> Treatment of skin and skin structure infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing isolates of <i>S. aureus</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i> species, or <i>E. coli</i>.</p><p><b>Urinary tract infections:</b> Treatment of complicated and uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing isolates of <i>E. coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i> species, <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (and other <i>Pseudomonas</i> species), <i>Citrobacter</i> species, <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i>, <i>Serratia marcescens</i>, or <i>S. aureus</i>.</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Intra-abdominal infections</h3><p>Based on the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), Diagnosis and Management of Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections in Adults and Children guidelines, ticarcillin and clavulanate potassium is an effective and recommended treatment option for adults with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections of mild to moderate severity (eg, perforated or abscessed appendicitis).</p><h3>Cystic fibrosis exacerbations</h3><p>Data from a clinical review suggests the use of ticarcillin and clavulanate potassium in the management of cystic fibrosis exacerbations <sup>[Zobell 2013]</sup>.

Further dilute to a final concentration of 10-100 mg/mL in D<sub>5</sub>W, LR, or NS.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IV: Infuse over 30 minutes.</p><p>Some penicillins (eg, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and piperacillin) have been shown to inactivate aminoglycosides <i>in vitro</i>. This has been observed to a greater extent with tobramycin and gentamicin, while amikacin has shown greater stability against inactivation. Concurrent use of these agents may pose a risk of reduced antibacterial efficacy <i>in vivo</i>, particularly in the setting of profound renal impairment. However, definitive clinical evidence is lacking. If combination penicillin/aminoglycoside therapy is desired in a patient with renal dysfunction, separation of doses (if feasible), and routine monitoring of aminoglycoside levels, CBC, and clinical response should be considered.</p><h2>Dietary Considerations</h2><p>Some products may contain potassium and/or sodium.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Vials: Store intact vials at ≤24°C (≤75°F). Reconstituted solution is stable for 6 hours at room temperature and 72 hours when refrigerated. IV infusion in NS or LR is stable for 24 hours at room temperature (21°C to 24°C [70°F to 75°F]), 7 days when refrigerated (4°C [39°F]), or 30 days when frozen (-18°C [0°F]). IV infusion in D<sub>5</sub>W solution is stable for 24 hours at room temperature (21°C to 24°C [70°F to 75°F]), 3 days when refrigerated (4°C [39°F]), or 7 days when frozen (-18°C [0°F]. After freezing, thawed solution is stable for 8 hours at room temperature. Do not refreeze. Darkening of drug indicates loss of potency of clavulanate potassium.</p><p>Premixed solution: Store frozen at ≤-20°C (-4°F).

Based on available data, penicillin antibiotics are generally considered compatible for use during pregnancy (Ailes 2016; Bookstaver 2015; Crider 2009; Damkier 2019; Lamont 2014; Muanda 2017a; Muanda 2017b).</p><p>Ticarcillin/clavulanate is approved for the treatment of postpartum gynecologic infections, including endometritis, caused by susceptible organisms.</p><h2>More about clavulanate / ticarcillin</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
