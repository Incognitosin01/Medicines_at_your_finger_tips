Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP in 5% Dextrose, like other fluoroquinolones, is associated with arthropathy and histopathological changes in weight-bearing joints of juvenile animals [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.11), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Lower Respiratory Tract Infections</span></p><p>Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP in 5% Dextrose is not a drug of first choice in the treatment of presumed or confirmed pneumonia secondary to <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> [<span class="Italics">see Indications and Usage (1.2)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Usage</h3><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP in 5% Dextrose and other antibacterial drugs, Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP in 5% Dextrose should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><p>If anaerobic organisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, appropriate therapy should be administered. Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Therapy with Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP in 5% Dextrose may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available appropriate therapy should be continued. As with other drugs, some isolates of <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with ciprofloxacin. Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy will provide information not only on the therapeutic effect of the antimicrobial agent but also on the possible emergence of bacterial resistance.</p><h2>Ciprofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin should be administered intravenously at dosages described in the appropriate Dosage Guidelines tables.</p><h3>2.1 Dosage in Adults</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The determination of dosage and duration for any particular patient must take into consideration the severity and nature of the infection, the susceptibility of the causative microorganism, the integrity of the patient’s host-defense mechanisms, and the status of renal function.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infection<span class="Sup">1</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Frequency</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Usual Duration</span></p><p class="First">Urinary Tract</p><p class="First">200 mg to 400 mg</p><p class="First">every 12 to every 8 hours</p><p class="First">7 to 14 days</p><p class="First">Lower Respiratory Tract</p><p class="First">400 mg</p><p class="First">every 12 to every 8 hours</p><p class="First">7 to 14 days</p><p class="First">Nosocomial Pneumonia</p><p class="First">400 mg</p><p class="First">every 8 hours</p><p class="First">10 to 14 days</p><p class="First">Skin and Skin Structure</p><p class="First">400 mg</p><p class="First">every 12 to every 8 hours</p><p class="First">7 to 14 days</p><p class="First">Bone and Joint</p><p class="First">400 mg</p><p class="First">every 12 to every 8 hours</p><p class="First">4 to 8 weeks</p><p class="First">Complicated Intra-Abdominal<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">400 mg</p><p class="First">every 12 hours</p><p class="First">7 to 14 days</p><p class="First">Acute Sinusitis</p><p class="First">400 mg</p><p class="First">every 12 hours</p><p class="First">10 days</p><p class="First">Chronic Bacterial Prostatitis</p><p class="First">400 mg</p><p class="First">every 12 hours</p><p class="First">28 days</p><p class="First">Empirical Therapy In Febrile<br/>

These alternative pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment. Nonetheless, some modification of dosage is recommended, particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction. Dosage guidelines for use in patients with renal impairment are shown in Table 4.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Creatinine Clearance (mL/min)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose</span></p><p class="First">&gt; 30</p><p class="First">See Usual Dosage</p><p class="First">5 to 29</p><p class="First">200 to 400 mg every 18 to 24 hours</p><p>When only the serum creatinine concentration is known, the following formulas may be used to estimate creatinine clearance:</p><p><span class="Bold">Men</span> - Creatinine clearance (mL/min) = <span class="Bold">Weight (kg) x (140 – age)</span><br/>
                                                            72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)</p><p><span class="Bold">Women</span> - 0.85 x the value calculated for men.</p><p>The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.</p><p>In patients with severe infections and severe renal impairment and hepatic insufficiency, careful monitoring is suggested.</p><p>Pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency were excluded from the clinical trial of cUTI and pyelonephritis. No information is available on dosing adjustments necessary for pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (that is, creatinine clearance of &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><h3>Preparation of Ciprofloxacin for Administration</h3><p class="First">The 2 mg/mL infusion solution in 5% dextrose is available in flexible containers of 100 mL or 200 mL. The solutions in flexible containers do not need to be diluted and may be infused as described below.</p><p>If the Y-type or “piggyback” method of administration is used, it is advisable to discontinue temporarily the administration of any other solutions during the infusion of ciprofloxacin. If the concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and another drug is necessary each drug should be given separately in accordance with the recommended dosage and route of administration for each drug.</p><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Intravenous Infusion</span></p><p>Ciprofloxacin should be administered to by intravenous infusion over a period of 60 minutes. Slow infusion of a dilute solution into a larger vein will minimize patient discomfort and reduce the risk of venous irritation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hydration of Patients Receiving Ciprofloxacin</span></p><p>Adequate hydration of patients receiving ciprofloxacin should be maintained to prevent the formation of highly concentrated urine. Crystalluria has been reported with quinolones [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.12), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Injection (100 mL in 5% Dextrose, 200 mg) and (200 mL in 5% Dextrose, 400 mg) latex-free flexible containers, for intravenous infusion.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin, any member of the quinolone class of antibacterials, or any of the product components [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Tizanidine</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration with tizanidine is contraindicated [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Tendinopathy and Tendon Rupture</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and rupture of the Achilles tendon may require surgical repair. Tendinitis and tendon rupture in the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites have also been reported. The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Factors, in addition to age and corticosteroid use, that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Inflammation and tendon rupture can occur, sometimes bilaterally, even within the first 48 hours, during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after completion of therapy have been reported. Ciprofloxacin should be used with caution in patients with a history of tendon disorders. Ciprofloxacin should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>].</p><h3>Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse events, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid ciprofloxacin in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>].</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving quinolone therapy, including ciprofloxacin. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Only a few patients had a history of hypersensitivity reactions. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitation measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, intravenous antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines, and airway management, including intubation, as indicated [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Reactions</h3><p class="First">Other serious and sometimes fatal events, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported in patients receiving therapy with quinolones, including ciprofloxacin. These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following:</p><p>Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and supportive measures instituted [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Cases of severe hepatotoxicity, including hepatic necrosis, life-threatening hepatic failure, and fatal events, have been reported with ciprofloxacin. Acute liver injury is rapid in onset (range 1–39 days), and is often associated with hypersensitivity. The pattern of injury can be hepatocellular, cholestatic or mixed. Most patients with fatal outcomes were older than 55 years old. In the event of any signs and symptoms of hepatitis (such as anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, or tender abdomen), discontinue treatment immediately.</p><p>There can be a temporary increase in transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, or cholestatic jaundice, especially in patients with previous liver damage, who are treated with ciprofloxacin [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3)</span>].</p><h3>Serious Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Theophylline</h3><p class="First">Serious and fatal reactions have been reported in patients receiving concurrent administration of intravenous ciprofloxacin and theophylline. These reactions have included cardiac arrest, seizure, status epilepticus, and respiratory failure. Instances of nausea, vomiting, tremor, irritability, or palpitation have also occurred.</p><p>Although similar serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving theophylline alone, the possibility that these reactions may be potentiated by ciprofloxacin cannot be eliminated. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, monitor serum levels of theophylline and adjust dosage as appropriate [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><h3>Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">Convulsions, increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri), and toxic psychosis have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin may also cause central nervous system (CNS) events including: nervousness, agitation, insomnia, anxiety, nightmares, paranoia, dizziness, confusion, tremors, hallucinations, depression, and, psychotic reactions have progressed to suicidal ideations/thoughts and self-injurious behavior such as attempted or completed suicide. These reactions may occur following the first dose. Advise patients receiving ciprofloxacin to inform their healthcare provider immediately if these reactions occur, discontinue the drug, and institute appropriate care. Ciprofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold. As with all fluoroquinolones, use ciprofloxacin with caution in epileptic patients and patients with known or suspected CNS disorders that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, previous history of convulsion, reduced cerebral blood flow, altered brain structure, or stroke), or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (for example, certain drug therapy, renal dysfunction). Use ciprofloxacin when the benefits of treatment exceed the risks, since these patients are endangered because of possible undesirable CNS side effects. Cases of status epilepticus have been reported. If seizures occur, discontinue ciprofloxacin [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><h3>Clostridium Difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)-</span>associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ciprofloxacin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and institute surgical evaluation as clinically indicated [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>].</p><h3>Peripheral Neuropathy</h3><p class="First">Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of ciprofloxacin and may be irreversible. Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness, or other alterations in sensations including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense and vibratory sensation, and/or motor strength in order to minimize the development of an irreversible condition [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)</span>].</p><h3>Prolongation of the QT Interval</h3><p class="First">Some fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram and cases of arrhythmia. Cases of torsade de pointes have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin. Avoid ciprofloxacin in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, risk factors for QT prolongation or torsade de pointes (for example, congenital long QT syndrome , uncorrected electrolyte imbalance, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia and cardiac disease, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, or bradycardia), and patients receiving Class IA antiarrhythmic agents (quinidine, procainamide), or Class III antiarrhythmic agents (amiodarone, sotalol), tricyclic antidepressants, macrolides, and antipsychotics. Elderly patients may also be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</span>].</p><h3>Musculoskeletal Disorders in Pediatric Patients and Arthropathic Effects in Animals</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is indicated in pediatric patients (less than 18 years of age) only for cUTI, prevention of inhalational anthrax (post-exposure), and plague [<span class="Italics">see Indications and Usage (1.10, 1.11, 1.12)</span>]. An increased incidence of adverse reactions compared to controls, including reactions related to joints and/or surrounding tissues, has been observed [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>].</p><p>In pre-clinical studies, oral administration of ciprofloxacin caused lameness in immature dogs.

In rabbits, oral ciprofloxacin dose levels of 30 and 100 mg/kg (approximately 0.4-and 1.3-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area) produced gastrointestinal toxicity resulting in maternal weight loss and an increased incidence of abortion, but no teratogenicity was observed at either dose level. After intravenous administration of doses up to 20 mg/kg (approximately 0.3-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area), no maternal toxicity was produced and no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is excreted in human milk.

This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential adverse reaction and advised to discontinue ciprofloxacin and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur<span class="Italics"> </span>[<span class="Italics">see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>].</p><p>In a retrospective analysis of 23 multiple-dose controlled clinical trials of ciprofloxacin encompassing over 3500 ciprofloxacin-treated patients, 25% of patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 10% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p>In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion; however, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the biliary system of the liver and through the intestine. These alternative pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment. Nonetheless, some modification of dosage is recommended, particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In preliminary studies in patients with stable chronic liver cirrhosis, no significant changes in ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been observed. The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in patients with acute hepatic insufficiency, have not been studied.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of acute overdosage, reversible renal toxicity has been reported in some cases. Observe the patient carefully and give supportive treatment, including monitoring of renal function, urinary pH and acidify, if required, to prevent crystalluria. Adequate hydration must be maintained. Only a small amount of ciprofloxacin (less than 10%) is removed from the body after hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.</p><p>In mice, rats, rabbits and dogs, significant toxicity including tonic/clonic convulsions was observed at intravenous doses of ciprofloxacin between 125 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg.</p><h2>Ciprofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Description</h2><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP in 5% Dextrose is a synthetic broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent for intravenous (IV) administration.

Its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">18</span>FN<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span> and its chemical structure is:</p><p>Ciprofloxacin is a faint to light yellow crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 331.4. It is soluble in dilute (0.1N) hydrochloric acid and is practically insoluble in water and ethanol. Ciprofloxacin is available as a 2 mg/mL ready-for-use infusion solution in 5% Dextrose Injection. The formula contains lactic acid as a solubilizing agent and hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment. The pH range for the solution is 3.5 to 4.6.</p><p>The flexible plastic container is latex-free and is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride. Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period, for example, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), up to 5 parts per million. The suitability of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies.</p><h2>Ciprofloxacin in 5% Dextrose - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is a member of the fluoroquinolone class of antibacterial agents [<span class="Italics">see Microbiology (12.4)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following 60-minute intravenous infusions of 200 mg and 400 mg ciprofloxacin to normal volunteers, the mean maximum serum concentrations achieved were 2.1 and 4.6 mcg/mL, respectively; the concentrations at 12 hours were 0.1 and 0.2 mcg/mL, respectively (Table 9).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Time after starting the infusion</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">30 minutes</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">1 hour</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">3 hour</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">6 hour</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">8 hour</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">12 hour</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">200 mg</span></p><p class="First">1.7</p><p class="First">2.1</p><p class="First">0.6</p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">0.2</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">400 mg</span></p><p class="First">3.7</p><p class="First">4.6</p><p class="First">1.3</p><p class="First">0.7</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">0.2</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin are linear over the dose range of 200 mg to 400 mg administered intravenously.

An intravenous infusion of 400-mg ciprofloxacin given over 60 minutes every 12 hours has been shown to produce an area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) equivalent to that produced by a 500-mg oral dose given every 12 hours. An intravenous infusion of 400 mg ciprofloxacin given over 60 minutes every 8 hours has been shown to produce an AUC at steady-state equivalent to that produced by a 750-mg oral dose given every 12 hours. A 400-mg intravenous dose results in a C max similar to that observed with a 750-mg oral dose.

Tissue concentrations often exceed serum concentrations in both men and women, particularly in genital tissue including the prostate. Ciprofloxacin is present in active form in the saliva, nasal and bronchial secretions, mucosa of the sinuses, sputum, skin blister fluid, lymph, peritoneal fluid, bile, and prostatic secretions. Ciprofloxacin has also been detected in lung, skin, fat, muscle, cartilage, and bone. The drug diffuses into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); however, CSF concentrations are generally less than 10% of peak serum concentrations. Low levels of the drug have been detected in the aqueous and vitreous humors of the eye.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>After intravenous administration, three metabolites of ciprofloxacin have been identified in human urine which together account for approximately 10% of the intravenous dose. The metabolites have antimicrobial activity, but are less active than unchanged. Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) mediated metabolism. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the co-administered drug [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.15) Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>The serum elimination half-life is approximately 5 to 6 hours and the total clearance is around 35 L/hr. After intravenous administration, approximately 50% to 70% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Following a 200-mg intravenous dose, concentrations in the urine usually exceed 200 mcg/mL 0 to 2 hours after dosing and are generally greater than 15 mcg/mL 8 to 12 hours after dosing. Following a 400 mg intravenous dose, urine concentrations generally exceed 400 mcg/mL 0 to 2 hours after dosing and are usually greater than 30 mcg/mL 8 to 12 hours after dosing. The renal clearance is approximately 22 L/hr. The urinary excretion of ciprofloxacin is virtually complete by 24 hours after dosing.</p><p>Although bile concentrations of ciprofloxacin are several fold higher than serum concentrations after intravenous dosing, only a small amount of the administered dose (&lt;less than1%) is recovered from the bile as unchanged drug. Approximately 15% of an intravenous dose is recovered from the feces within 5 days after dosing.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly</span></p><p>Pharmacokinetic studies of the oral (single dose) and intravenous (single and multiple dose) forms of ciprofloxacin indicate that plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin are higher in elderly subjects (older than 65 years) as compared to young adults. Although the C<span class="Sub">max</span> is increased 16% to 40%, the increase in mean AUC is approximately 30%, and can be at least partially attributed to decreased renal clearance in the elderly.

There was no apparent age-dependence, and no notable increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> or AUC upon multiple dosing (10 mg/kg three times a day). In children with severe sepsis who were given intravenous ciprofloxacin (10 mg/kg as a 1-hour infusion), the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 6.1 mcg/mL (range: 4.6 mcg/mL to 8.3 mcg/mL) in 10 children less than 1 year of age; and 7.2 mcg/mL (range: 4.7 mcg/mL to 11.8 mcg/mL) in 10 children between 1 year and 5 years of age. The AUC values were 17.4 mcg●hr/mL (range: 11.8 mcg●hr/mL to 32.0 mcg●hr/mL) and 16.5 mcg●hr/mL (range: 11 mcg●hr/mL to 23.8 mcg●hr/mL) in the respective age groups. These values are within the range reported for adults at therapeutic doses. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of pediatric patients with various infections, the predicted mean half-life in children is approximately 4 hours–5 hours, and the bioavailability of the oral suspension is approximately 60%.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug-Drug Interactions</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Metronidazole</span></p><p>The serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were not altered when these two drugs were given concomitantly.</p><p><span class="Bold">Tizanidine</span></p><p>In a pharmacokinetic study, systemic exposure of tizanidine (4 mg single dose) was significantly increased (C<span class="Sub">max</span> 7-fold, AUC 10-fold) when the drug was given concomitantly with ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice a day for 3 days).

In young beagles, 100 mg/kg ciprofloxacin, given daily for 4 weeks, caused degenerative articular changes of the knee joint. At 30 mg/kg, the effect on the joint was minimal. In a subsequent study in young beagle dogs, oral ciprofloxacin doses of 30 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg ciprofloxacin (approximately 1.3-times and 3.5-times the pediatric dose based upon comparative plasma AUCs) given daily for 2 weeks caused articular changes which were still observed by histopathology after a treatment-free period of 5 months. At 10 mg/kg (approximately 0.6-times the pediatric dose based upon comparative plasma AUCs), no effects on joints were observed. This dose was also not associated with arthrotoxicity after an additional treatment-free period of 5 months. In another study, removal of weight bearing from the joint reduced the lesions but did not totally prevent them.</p><p>Crystalluria, sometimes associated with secondary nephropathy, occurs in laboratory animals dosed with ciprofloxacin. This is primarily related to the reduced solubility of ciprofloxacin under alkaline conditions, which predominate in the urine of test animals; in man, crystalluria is rare since human urine is typically acidic. In rhesus monkeys, crystalluria without nephropathy was noted after single oral doses as low as 5 mg/kg (approximately 0.07-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area). After 6 months of intravenous dosing at 10 mg/kg/day, no nephropathological changes were noted; however, nephropathy was observed after dosing at 20 mg/kg/day for the same duration (approximately 0.2-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area).</p><p>In dogs, ciprofloxacin at 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg by rapid intravenous injection (15 sec.) produces pronounced hypotensive effects. These effects are considered to be related to histamine release, since they are partially antagonized by pyrilamine, an antihistamine. In rhesus monkeys, rapid intravenous injection also produces hypotension but the effect in this species is inconsistent and less pronounced.</p><p>In mice, concomitant administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as phenylbutazone and indomethacin with quinolones has been reported to enhance the CNS stimulatory effect of quinolones.</p><p>Ocular toxicity seen with some related drugs has not been observed in ciprofloxacin-treated animals.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Empirical Therapy In Adult Febrile Neutropenic Patients</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of ciprofloxacin, 400 mg intravenously every 8 hours, in combination with piperacillin sodium, 50 mg/kg intravenously every 4 hours, for the empirical therapy of febrile neutropenic patients were studied in one large pivotal multicenter, randomized trial and were compared to those of tobramycin, 2 mg/kg intravenously every 8 hours, in combination with piperacillin sodium, 50 mg/kg intravenously every 4 hours.</p><p>Clinical response rates observed in this study were as follows:</p><p>The clinical success and bacteriologic eradication rates in the Per Protocol population were similar between ciprofloxacin and the comparator group as shown in Table 13.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Outcomes</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ciprofloxacin/Piperacillin</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 233</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Success (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tobramycin/Piperacillin</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 237</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Success (%)</span></p><p class="First">Clinical Resolution of Initial Febrile Episode with No Modifications of Empirical Regimen<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p class="First">63 (27%)</p><p class="First">52 (21.9%)</p><p class="First">Clinical Resolution of Initial Febrile Episode Including Patients with Modifications of Empirical Regimen</p><p class="First">187 (80.3%)</p><p class="First">185 (78.1%)</p><p class="First">Overall Survival</p><p class="First">224 (96.1%)</p><p class="First">185 (78.1%)</p><h3>Complicated Urinary Tract Infection and Pyelonephritis–Efficacy in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin, administered IV and/or orally, was compared to a cephalosporin for treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and pyelonephritis in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age (mean age of 6 ± 4 years). The trial was conducted in the US, Canada, Argentina, Peru, Costa Rica, Mexico, South Africa, and Germany.

Ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in various human populations. The mean peak serum concentration achieved at steady-state in human adults receiving 500 mg orally every 12 hours is 2.97 mcg/mL, and 4.56 mcg/mL following 400 mg intravenously every 12 hours. The mean trough serum concentration at steady-state for both of these regimens is 0.2 mcg/mL. In a study of 10 pediatric patients between 6 and 16 years of age, the mean peak plasma concentration achieved is 8.3 mcg/mL and trough concentrations range from 0.09 mcg/mL to 0.26 mcg/mL, following two 30-minute intravenous infusions of 10 mg/kg administered 12 hours apart. After the second intravenous infusion patients switched to 15 mg/kg orally every 12 hours achieve a mean peak concentration of 3.6 mcg/mL after the initial oral dose. Long-term safety data, including effects on cartilage, following the administration of ciprofloxacin to pediatric patients are limited. Ciprofloxacin serum concentrations achieved in humans serve as a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and provide the basis for this indication.<span class="Sup">11</span></p><p>A placebo-controlled animal study in rhesus monkeys exposed to an inhaled mean dose of 11 LD<span class="Sub">50 </span>(~5.5 x 10<span class="Sup">5</span>) spores (range 5-30 LD<span class="Sub">50</span>) of <span class="Italics">B. anthracis</span> was conducted. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin for the anthrax strain used in this study was 0.08 mcg/mL. In the animals studied, mean serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin achieved at expected T<span class="Sub">max</span> (1 hour post-dose) following oral dosing to steady-state ranged from 0.98 mcg/mL to 1.69 mcg/mL. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at 12 hours post-dose ranged from 0.12 mcg/mL to 0.19 mcg/mL<span class="Sup">10</span>. Mortality due to anthrax for animals that received a 30-day regimen of oral ciprofloxacin beginning 24 hours post-exposure was significantly lower (1/9), compared to the placebo group (9/10) [p= 0.001]. The one ciprofloxacin-treated animal that died of anthrax did so following the 30-day drug administration period.<span class="Sup">11</span></p><p>More than 9,300 persons were recommended to complete a minimum of 60 days of antibacterial prophylaxis against possible inhalational exposure to <span class="Italics">B. anthracis</span> during 2001. Ciprofloxacin was recommended to most of those individuals for all or part of the prophylaxis regimen. Some persons were also given anthrax vaccine or were switched to alternative antibacterial drugs. No one who received ciprofloxacin or other therapies as prophylactic treatment subsequently developed inhalational anthrax. The number of persons who received ciprofloxacin as all or part of their post-exposure prophylaxis regimen is unknown.</p><h3>Plague</h3><p class="First">A placebo-controlled animal study in African green monkeys exposed to an inhaled mean dose of 110 LD<span class="Sub">50</span> (range 92 to 127 LD<span class="Sub">50</span>) of <span class="Italics">Yersinia pestis</span> (CO92 strain) was conducted. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin for the <span class="Italics">Y. pestis</span> strain used in this study was 0.015 mcg/mL. Mean peak serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin achieved at the end of a single 60 minute infusion were 3.49 mcg/mL ± 0.55 mcg/mL, 3.91 mcg/mL ± 0.58 mcg/mL and 4.03 mcg/mL ± 1.22 mcg/mL on Day 2, Day 6 and Day 10 of treatment in African green monkeys, respectively All trough concentrations (Day 2, Day 6 and Day 10) were &lt; 0.5 mcg/mL. Animals were randomized to receive either a 10-day regimen of intravenous ciprofloxacin 15 mg/kg, or placebo beginning when animals were found to be febrile (a body temperature greater than 1.5°C over baseline for two hours), or at 76 hours post-challenge, whichever occurred sooner. Mortality in the ciprofloxacin group was significantly lower (1/10) compared to the placebo group (2/2) [difference: -90.0%, 95% exact confidence interval: -99.8% to -5.8%]. The one ciprofloxacin-treated animal that died did not receive the proposed dose of ciprofloxacin due to a failure of the administration catheter. Circulating ciprofloxacin concentration was below 0.5 mcg/mL at all timepoints tested in this animal. It became culture negative on Day 2 of treatment, but had a resurgence of low grade bacteremia on Day 6 after treatment initiation. Terminal blood culture in this animal was negative.<span class="Sup">12</span></p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP in 5% dextrose is available as a clear, colorless to slightly yellowish solution.
