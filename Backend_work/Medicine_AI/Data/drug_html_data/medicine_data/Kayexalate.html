This helps prevent your body from absorbing too much potassium.</p><p>Kayexalate is used to treat high levels of potassium in the blood, also called hyperkalemia.</p><p>Kayexalate works differently from other medicines because it passes into your intestines without being absorbed into your blood stream.</p><p>Kayexalate may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use  Kayexalate if you have low potassium levels or a bowel obstruction.</p><p><b>Do not give this medicine orally (by mouth) to a newborn baby</b>.</p><p>Avoid taking other medicines by mouth within 3 hours before or 3 hours after you take Kayexalate (or 6 hours before/after if you have slow digestion).</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Kayexalate if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p><ul>
