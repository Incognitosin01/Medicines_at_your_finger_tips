Triamcinolone reduces the actions of chemicals in the body that cause inflammation.</p><p>Kenalog topical is used to treat the inflammation caused by a number of conditions such as allergic reactions, eczema, and psoriasis. The dental paste form of triamcinolone (Kenalog Orabase) is used to treat mouth ulcers.</p><p>Kenalog topical may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Use Kenalog exactly as directed on the label, or as it has been prescribed by your doctor.

If you are treating the diaper area of a baby, do not use plastic pants or tight-fitting diapers. Covering the skin that is treated with Kenalog can increase the amount of the drug your skin absorbs, which may lead to unwanted side effects.
