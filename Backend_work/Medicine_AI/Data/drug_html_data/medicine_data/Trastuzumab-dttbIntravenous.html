It can be used alone after a previous treatment with an anthracycline medicine or with other cancer medicines (eg, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, doxorubicin, paclitaxel).</p><p>Trastuzumab-dttb injection is also used alone to treat HER2-overexpressing metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer in patients who have previously received one or more cancer treatments or as first-line treatment together with paclitaxel to treat HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.</p><p>Trastuzumab-dttb injection is also used in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil to treat HER2-overexpressing metastatic (cancer that has spread) stomach and gastroesophageal (stomach and esophagus) cancer.</p><p>Trastuzumab-dttb prevents the growth of some tumors that produce extra amounts of a certain substance known as the HER2 protein. <i>It should only be used in patients whose tumors have been shown to produce extra amounts of this protein (HER2 overexpression)</i>. Your doctor will test for the presence of this protein.</p><p>Trastuzumab-dttb is a monoclonal antibody. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by trastuzumab-dttb, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.</p><p>Trastuzumab-dttb is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using trastuzumab-dttb</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
