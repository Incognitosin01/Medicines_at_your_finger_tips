Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>Your doctor will tell you which day to insert the first vaginal ring you use.

Avoid leaving the ring in place for longer than 3 weeks. <b>Call your doctor if you get off schedule, or if you have trouble removing a vaginal ring.</b></p><p>You may have breakthrough bleeding. Tell your doctor if this bleeding continues or is very heavy.</p><p><b>If you need major surgery or will be on long-term bed rest,</b> you may need to stop using this medicine for a short time. Any doctor or surgeon who treats you should know that you are using the NuvaRing vaginal ring.</p><p>Store unused vaginal rings at room temperature for up to 4 months. Protect from heat and light. Dispose of a used vaginal ring in the foil pouch it came in and throw it away where children and pets cannot get to it.

Carefully follow the Patient Instructions about how to replace a ring that has been out of the vagina for more than 3 hours.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel is not expected to be dangerous, but may cause nausea or vaginal bleeding.
