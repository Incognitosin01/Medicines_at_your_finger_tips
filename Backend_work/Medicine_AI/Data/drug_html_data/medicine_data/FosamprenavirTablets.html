</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Fosamprenavir Tablets</h2><p class="First">Fosamprenavir calcium tablets are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection.</p><p>The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with fosamprenavir calcium tabletsplus ritonavir in protease inhibitor-experienced patients:</p><h2>Fosamprenavir Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Dosing Information</h3><p class="First">Fosamprenavir calcium tablets may be taken with or without food.</p><p>Adults should take fosamprenavir calcium oral suspension without food. Pediatric patients should take fosamprenavir calcium oral suspension with food <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. If emesis occurs within 30 minutes after dosing, re-dosing of fosamprenavir calcium oral suspension should occur.</p><p>Higher-than-approved dose combinations of fosamprenavir calciumtablets plus ritonavir are not recommended due to an increased risk of transaminase elevations <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><p>When fosamprenavir calcium tablets are used in combination with ritonavir, prescribers should consult the full prescribing information for ritonavir.</p><h3>Adults</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Therapy-Naive Adults</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Protease Inhibitor-Experienced Adults</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span></span></p><h3>Pediatric Patients (Aged at Least 4 Weeks to 18 Years)</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of fosamprenavir calcium in patients aged at least 4 weeks to 18 years should be calculated based on body weight (kg) and should not exceed the recommended adult dose (Table 1).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1.

Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:</p><p>See Table 6 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir; review concomitant medications during therapy with fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir, and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including 1 case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome among 700 subjects treated with fosamprenavir calcium in clinical trials. Treatment with fosamprenavir calcium should be discontinued for severe or life-threatening rashes and for moderate rashes accompanied by systemic symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</p><h3>Sulfa Allergy</h3><p class="First">Fosamprenavir calcium should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. Fosamprenavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. The potential for cross-sensitivity between drugs in the sulfonamide class and fosamprenavir is unknown. In a clinical trial of fosamprenavir calcium used as the sole protease inhibitor, rash occurred in 2 of 10 subjects (20%) with a history of sulfonamide allergy compared with 42 of 126 subjects (33%) with no history of sulfonamide allergy. In 2 clinical trials of fosamprenavir calcium plus low-dose ritonavir, rash occurred in 8 of 50 subjects (16%) with a history of sulfonamide allergy compared with 50 of 412 subjects (12%) with no history of sulfonamide allergy.</p><h3>Hepatic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Use of fosamprenavir calcium with ritonavir at higher-than-recommended dosages may result in transaminase elevations and should not be used <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2), Overdosage (10)]</span>. Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C or marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment may be at increased risk for developing or worsening of transaminase elevations. Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with fosamprenavir calcium and patients should be monitored closely during treatment.</p><h3>Diabetes/Hyperglycemia</h3><p class="First">New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-1-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and causal relationships between protease inhibitor therapy and these events have not been established.</p><h3>Immune Reconstitution Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including fosamprenavir calcium. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium avium</span> infection, cytomegalovirus, <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span> pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.</p><p>Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.</p><h3>Increase in Body Fat</h3><p class="First">Increase of body fat has been observed in patients receiving protease inhibitors, including fosamprenavir calcium. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.</p><h3>Lipid Elevations</h3><p class="First">Treatment with fosamprenavir calcium plus ritonavir has resulted in increases in the concentration of triglycerides and cholesterol <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>. Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior to initiating therapy with fosamprenavir calcium and at periodic intervals during therapy. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Hemolytic Anemia</h3><p class="First">Acute hemolytic anemia has been reported in a patient treated with amprenavir.</p><h3>Patients with Hemophilia</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of spontaneous bleeding in patients with hemophilia A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients, additional factor VIII was required. In many of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or restarted. A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these episodes has not been established.</p><h3>Nephrolithiasis</h3><p class="First">Cases of nephrolithiasis were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-1-infected patients receiving fosamprenavir calcium. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered.</p><h3>Resistance/Cross-Resistance</h3><p class="First">Because the potential for HIV cross-resistance among protease inhibitors has not been fully explored, it is unknown what effect therapy with fosamprenavir calcium will have on the activity of subsequently administered protease inhibitors. Fosamprenavir calcium has been studied in patients who have experienced treatment failure with protease inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adult Trials</span></p><p>The data for the 3 active-controlled clinical trials described below reflect exposure of 700 HIV-1-infected subjects to fosamprenavir calcium tablets, including 599 subjects exposed to fosamprenavir calcium for greater than 24 weeks, and 409 subjects exposed for greater than 48 weeks. The population age ranged from 17 to 72 years. Of these subjects, 26% were female, 51% white, 31% black, 16% American Hispanic, and 70% were antiretroviral-naive. Sixty-one percent received fosamprenavir calcium 1,400 mg once daily plus ritonavir 200 mg once daily; 24% received fosamprenavir calcium 1,400 mg twice daily; and 15% received fosamprenavir calcium 700 mg twice daily plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily.</p><p>Selected adverse reactions reported during the clinical efficacy trials of fosamprenavir calcium are shown in Tables 2 and 3.

Rashes were usually maculopapular and of mild or moderate intensity, some with pruritus. Rash had a median onset of 11 days after initiation of fosamprenavir calcium and had a median duration of 13 days. Skin rash led to discontinuation of fosamprenavir calcium in less than 1% of subjects. In some subjects with mild or moderate rash, dosing with fosamprenavir calcium was often continued without interruption; if interrupted, reintroduction of fosamprenavir calcium generally did not result in rash recurrence.</p><p>The percentages of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities in the clinical efficacy trials of fosamprenavir calcium are presented in Tables 4 and 5.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4.

Data also suggest that amprenavir induces CYP3A4.</p><p>Amprenavir is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of fosamprenavir calcium and drugs that induce CYP3A4, such as rifampin, may decrease amprenavir concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect. Coadministration of fosamprenavir calcium and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase amprenavir concentrations and increase the incidence of adverse effects.</p><p>The potential for drug interactions with fosamprenavir calcium changes when fosamprenavir calcium is coadministered with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir. The magnitude of CYP3A4-mediated drug interactions (effect on amprenavir or effect on coadministered drug) may change when fosamprenavir calcium is coadministered with ritonavir. Because ritonavir is a CYP2D6 inhibitor, clinically significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 are possible when coadministered with fosamprenavir calcium plus ritonavir. Ritonavir also appears to induce CYP3A, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6, as well as other enzymes, including glucuronosyl transferase.</p><p>There are other agents that may result in serious and/or life-threatening drug interactions <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">If fosamprenavir calcium is used in combination with ritonavir, see full prescribing information for ritonavir for additional information on drug interactions <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Table 6 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions.

Given the limited number of pregnancies exposed to fosamprenavir-based regimens, no conclusions can be drawn on the safety of fosamprenavir in pregnancy. The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. The background rate for major birth defects in a U.S. reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) is 2.7% <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.

Systemic exposure to amprenavir (the active ingredient) was less than (rabbits) or up to 2 times (rats) those in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) with or without ritonavir. In contrast, oral administration of amprenavir was associated with abortions in pregnant rabbits at doses that produced approximately one-twentieth the human exposure at the MRHD.</p><p>In the rat pre- and postnatal development study, toxicities to the offspring, including reduced survival and reproductive performance, were observed at maternal systemic exposures (AUC) to amprenavir that were approximately 2 times the exposure in humans at the MRHD of fosamprenavir alone or approximately the same as those seen in humans following administration of the MRHD of fosamprenavir in combination with ritonavir <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Virologic Monitoring During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period:</span> Based on limited data on the use of fosamprenavir calcium during pregnancy, no dosage adjustments are required for pregnant patients who are already on a stable twice-daily regimen of fosamprenavir calcium 700 mg taken with ritonavir 100 mg prior to pregnancy, and who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.

Amprenavir pharmacokinetics and placental transfer were studied during the second trimester (n = 6) or third trimester (n = 9) and postpartum (n = 9). Pregnancy outcomes were available for all 10 subjects, among which 1 twin pregnancy was included. Compared to the postpartum period, geometric mean amprenavir AUC was 35% lower in the second trimester and 25% lower in the third trimester. The amprenavir geometric mean ratio (95% CI) of fetal cord to maternal peripheral plasma concentration (n = 7) was 0.27 (0.24 to 0.30) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> At delivery, 9 subjects had HIV-1 viral load less than 50 copies/mL, and 1 subject had a viral load of 111 copies/mL. All 11 infants born had test results that were negative for HIV-1 at the time of delivery and through 12 months postpartum. There were no new safety findings compared with the known safety profile of fosamprenavir calcium /ritonavir in HIV-1–infected adults.</p><p>Based on prospective reports to the APR of approximately 146 live births following exposure to fosamprenavir-containing regimens, there were 2 birth defects reported in 109 first trimester exposures and 2 birth defects reported in 36 second and third trimester exposures. The background rate for major birth defects is 2.7% in a U.S. reference population of the MACDP. Prospective reports from the APR of overall major birth defects in pregnancies exposed to fosamprenavir are compared with the U.S. background major birth defect rate. Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group. Limitations of using an external comparator include differences in methodology and populations as well as confounding due to the underlying disease.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data:</span> Fosamprenavir was administered orally to pregnant rats (300, 820, or 2,240 mg per kg per day) and rabbits (74.8, 224.3, or 672.8 mg per kg per day) on Gestation Days 6 to 17 and Days 7 to 20, respectively. No major adverse effects on embryo-fetal development were observed at these dose levels, resulting in exposures (AUC<span class="Sub">0-24 h</span>) approximately 2 times (rats) and 0.8 times (rabbits) human exposures at the MRHD of fosamprenavir alone or 0.7 times (rats) and 0.3 times (rabbits) human exposures at the MRHD of fosamprenavir in combination with ritonavir. However, increased incidence of abortion was observed in rabbits administered a maternally toxic dose of fosamprenavir (672.8 mg per kg per day). In a study where amprenavir was administered orally to pregnant rabbits (25, 50, or 100 mg per kg per day) on Gestation Days 8 to 20, increased abortions and an increased incidence of minor skeletal variations (deficient ossification of the femur, humerus, and trochlea) were observed at doses that produced approximately one-twentieth the exposure seen at the MRHD.</p><p>In the rat pre- and postnatal development study, fosamprenavir was administered orally (300, 820, or 2,240 mg per kg per day) on Gestation Day 6 to Lactation/Postpartum Day 20. Fosamprenavir caused a reduction in pup survival and body weights. In surviving female offspring from the high-dose group, an increased time to successful mating, an increased length of gestation, a reduced number of uterine implantation sites per litter, and reduced gestational body weights were observed. Systemic exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">0-24 h</span>) to amprenavir in rats was approximately 2 times the exposures in humans at the MRHD of fosamprenavir alone or approximately the same as those seen in humans at the MRHD of fosamprenavir in combination with ritonavir.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection.</p><p>There is no information available on the presence of amprenavir in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production.

Concurrent Grade 1/2 elevations in AST (greater than 1.25 x ULN) were noted in 3 of these 4 subjects. These transaminase elevations resolved following discontinuation of dosing.</p><p>There is no known antidote for fosamprenavir calcium. It is not known whether amprenavir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis, although it is unlikely as amprenavir is highly protein bound. If overdosage occurs, the patient should be monitored for evidence of toxicity and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary.</p><h2>Fosamprenavir Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Fosamprenavir calcium is a prodrug of amprenavir, an inhibitor of HIV protease. The chemical name of fosamprenavir calcium is (3S)-tetrahydrofuran-3-yl (1S,2R)-3-[[(4-aminophenyl) sulfonyl](isobutyl)amino]-1-benzyl-2-(phosphonooxy) propylcarbamate monocalcium salt. Fosamprenavir calcium is a single stereoisomer with the (3<span class="Italics">S</span>)(1<span class="Italics">S</span>,2<span class="Italics">R</span>) configuration. It has a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">25</span>H<span class="Sub">34</span>CaN<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">9</span>PS and a molecular weight of 623.7.

Amprenavir is an inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. Amprenavir binds to the active site of HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors, resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antiviral Activity</span></p><p>Fosamprenavir has little or no antiviral activity in cell culture. The antiviral activity of amprenavir was evaluated against HIV-1 IIIB in both acutely and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and in peripheral blood lymphocytes in cell culture. The 50% effective concentration (EC<span class="Sub">50</span>) of amprenavir ranged from 0.012 to 0.08 microM in acutely infected cells and was 0.41 microM in chronically infected cells (1 microM = 0.50 mcg per mL). The median EC<span class="Sub">50</span> value of amprenavir against HIV-1 isolates from clades A to G was 0.00095 microM in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Similarly, the EC<span class="Sub">50</span> values for amprenavir against monocytes/macrophage tropic HIV-1 isolates (clade B) ranged from 0.003 to 0.075 microM in monocyte/macrophage cultures. The EC<span class="Sub">50</span> values of amprenavir against HIV-2 isolates grown in PBMCs were higher than those for HIV-1 isolates, and ranged from 0.003 to 0.11 microM. The anti-HIV-1 activity of amprenavir was not antagonistic in combination with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs); abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zidovudine; the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) delavirdine, efavirenz, and nevirapine; the protease inhibitors (PIs) atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir; and the gp41 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide. These drug combinations have not been adequately studied in humans.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Resistance</span></p><p>HIV-1 isolates with decreased susceptibility to amprenavir have been selected in cell culture and obtained from subjects treated with fosamprenavir. Genotypic analysis of isolates from treatment-naive subjects failing amprenavir-containing regimens showed substitutions in the HIV-1 protease resulting in amino acid substitutions primarily at positions V32I, M46I/L, I47V, I50V, I54L/M, and I84V, as well as substitutions in the p7/p1 and p1/p6 Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor cleavage sites. Some of these amprenavir resistance-associated substitutions have also been detected in HIV-1 isolates from antiretroviral-naive subjects treated with fosamprenavir calcium. Of the 488 antiretroviral-naive subjects treated with fosamprenavir calcium 1,400 mg twice daily or fosamprenavir calcium 1,400 mg plus ritonavir 200 mg once daily in Trials APV30001 and APV30002, respectively, isolates from 61 subjects (29 receiving fosamprenavir calcium and 32 receiving fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir) with virologic failure (plasma HIV-1 RNA greater than 1,000 copies per mL on 2 occasions on or after Week 12) were genotyped. Isolates from 5 of the 29 antiretroviral-naive subjects (17%) receiving fosamprenavir calcium without ritonavir in Trial APV30001 had evidence of genotypic resistance to amprenavir: I54L/M (n = 2), I54L + L33F (n = 1), V32I + I47V (n = 1), and M46I + I47V (n = 1). No amprenavir resistance-associated substitutions were detected in isolates from antiretroviral-naive subjects treated with fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir for 48 weeks in Trial APV30002. However, the M46I and I50V substitutions were detected in isolates from 1 virologic failure subject receiving fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir once daily at Week 160 (HIV-1 RNA greater than 500 copies per mL). Upon retrospective analysis of stored samples using an ultrasensitive assay, these resistant substitutions were traced back to Week 84 (76 weeks prior to clinical virologic failure).</p><p><span class="Bold">Cross-Resistance</span></p><p>Varying degrees of cross-resistance among HIV-1 protease inhibitors have been observed. An association between virologic response at 48 weeks (HIV-1 RNA level less than 400 copies per mL) and protease inhibitor-resistance substitutions detected in baseline HIV-1 isolates from protease inhibitor-experienced subjects receiving fosamprenavir calcium /ritonavir twice daily (n = 88), or lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily (n = 85) in Trial APV30003 is shown in Table 14. The majority of subjects had previously received either one (47%) or 2 protease inhibitors (36%), most commonly nelfinavir (57%) and indinavir (53%). Out of 102 subjects with baseline phenotypes receiving twice-daily fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir, 54% (n = 55) had resistance to at least one protease inhibitor, with 98% (n = 54) of those having resistance to nelfinavir. Out of 97 subjects with baseline phenotypes in the lopinavir/ritonavir arm, 60% (n = 58) had resistance to at least one protease inhibitor, with 97% (n = 56) of those having resistance to nelfinavir.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 14.

Baseline isolates from protease inhibitor-experienced subjects responding to fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir twice daily had a median shift in susceptibility to amprenavir relative to a standard wild-type reference strain of 0.7 (range: 0.1 to 5.4, n = 62), and baseline isolates from individuals failing therapy had a median shift in susceptibility of 1.9 (range: 0.2 to 14, n = 29). Because this was a select patient population, these data do not constitute definitive clinical susceptibility break points. Additional data are needed to determine clinically relevant break points for fosamprenavir calcium.</p><p>Isolates from 15 of the 20 subjects receiving twice-daily fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir up to Week 48 and experiencing virologic failure/ongoing replication were subjected to genotypic analysis. The following amprenavir resistance-associated substitutions were found either alone or in combination: V32I, M46I/L, I47V, I50V, I54L/M, and I84V. Isolates from 4 of the 16 subjects continuing to receive twice-daily fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir up to Week 96 who experienced virologic failure underwent genotypic analysis. Isolates from 2 subjects contained amprenavir resistance-associated substitutions: V32I, M46I, and I47V in 1 isolate and I84V in the other.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">In long-term carcinogenicity studies, fosamprenavir was administered orally for up to 104 weeks at doses of 250, 400, or 600 mg per kg per day in mice and at doses of 300, 825, or 2,250 mg per kg per day in rats. Exposures at these doses were 0.3- to 0.7-fold (mice) and 0.7- to 1.4-fold (rats) those in humans given 1,400 mg twice daily of fosamprenavir alone, and 0.2- to 0.3-fold (mice) and 0.3- to 0.7-fold (rats) those in humans given 1,400 mg once daily of fosamprenavir plus 200 mg ritonavir once daily. Exposures in the carcinogenicity studies were 0.1- to 0.3-fold (mice) and 0.3- to 0.6-fold (rats) those in humans given 700 mg of fosamprenavir plus 100 mg ritonavir twice daily. There was an increase in hepatocellular adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas at all doses in male mice and at 600 mg per kg per day in female mice, and in hepatocellular adenomas and thyroid follicular cell adenomas at all doses in male rats, and at 825 mg per kg per day and 2,250 mg per kg per day in female rats. The relevance of the hepatocellular findings in the rodents for humans is uncertain. Repeat-dose studies with fosamprenavir in rats produced effects consistent with enzyme induction, which predisposes rats, but not humans, to thyroid neoplasms. In addition, in rats only there was an increase in interstitial cell hyperplasia at 825 mg per kg per day and 2,250 mg per kg per day, and an increase in uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma at 2,250 mg per kg per day. The incidence of endometrial findings was slightly increased over concurrent controls, but was within background range for female rats. The relevance of the uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma findings in rats for humans is uncertain.</p><p>Fosamprenavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> assays. These assays included bacterial reverse mutation (Ames), mouse lymphoma, rat micronucleus, and chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes.</p><p>The effects of fosamprenavir on fertility and general reproductive performance were investigated in male (treated for 4 weeks before mating) and female rats (treated for 2 weeks before mating through Postpartum Day 6) that received doses of 300, 820, or 2,240 mg per kg per day. Systemic exposures (AUC<span class="Sub">0-24 h</span>) to amprenavir in these studies were 3 (males) to 4 (females) times higher than exposures in humans following administration of the MRHD of fosamprenavir alone or similar to those seen in humans following administration of fosamprenavir in combination with ritonavir. Fosamprenavir did not impair mating or fertility of male or female rats and did not affect the development and maturation of sperm from treated rats.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Therapy-Naive Adult Trials</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">APV30001</span></p><p>A randomized, open-label trial evaluated treatment with fosamprenavir calcium tablets (1,400 mg twice daily) versus nelfinavir (1,250 mg twice daily) in 249 antiretroviral treatment-naive subjects.

Through Week 48, 50% and 37% of subjects receiving fosamprenavir calcium 1,400 mg plus ritonavir 200 mg once daily had plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies per mL and less than 50 copies per mL, respectively.</p><h3>Pediatric Trials</h3><p class="First">Three open-label trials in pediatric subjects aged at least 4 weeks to 18 years were conducted. In one trial (APV29005), twice-daily dosing regimens (fosamprenavir calcium with or without ritonavir) were evaluated in combination with other antiretroviral agents in pediatric subjects aged 2 to 18 years. In a second trial (APV20002), twice-daily dosing regimens (fosamprenavir calcium with ritonavir) were evaluated in combination with other antiretroviral agents in pediatric subjects aged at least 4 weeks to younger than 2 years. A third trial (APV20003) evaluated once-daily dosing of fosamprenavir calcium with ritonavir; the pharmacokinetic data from this trial did not support a once-daily dosing regimen in any pediatric patient population.</p><p><span class="Bold">APV29005</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Fosamprenavir calcium:</span> Twenty (18 therapy-naive and 2 therapy-experienced) pediatric subjects received fosamprenavir calcium oral suspension without ritonavir twice daily.
