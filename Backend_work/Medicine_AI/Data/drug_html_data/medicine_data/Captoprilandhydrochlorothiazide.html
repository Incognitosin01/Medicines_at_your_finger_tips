High blood pressure adds to the work load of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Hypertension may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled .</p><p>Captopril works by blocking an enzyme in the body that is necessary to produce a substance that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, the blood vessels relax. Hydrochlorothiazide works by helping reduce the amount of salt and water in the body by acting on the kidneys to increase the flow of urine. Both of these medicines lower blood pressure and increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart .</p><p>Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide is available only with your doctor's prescription .</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using captopril and hydrochlorothiazide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Safety and efficacy have not been established .</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide combination in geriatric patients.
