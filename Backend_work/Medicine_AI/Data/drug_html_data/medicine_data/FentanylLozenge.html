</ul><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</span><br/>
Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient’s risk prior to prescribing oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program</span><br/>
Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose, oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is available only through a restricted program required by the Food and Drug Administration, called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Under the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>. Further information is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</span><br/>
Prolonged use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span>.</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Fentanyl Lozenge</h2><p class="First">Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients 16 years of age and older who are already receiving and who are tolerant to around-the-clock opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain.</p><p>Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking, for one week or longer, around-the-clock medicine consisting of at least 60 mg of oral morphine per day, at least 25 mcg of transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone per day, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per day, at least 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, at least 60 mg of oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.

The initial dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate to treat episodes of breakthrough cancer pain is <span class="Bold">always</span> 200 mcg<span class="Italics">.</span> The oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate unit should be consumed over 15 minutes. Patients should be prescribed an initial titration supply of six 200 mcg oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate units, thus limiting the number of units in the home during titration. Patients should use up all units before increasing to a higher dose to prevent confusion and possible overdose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Repeat Dosing</span><br/>
a.     In cases where the breakthrough pain episode is not relieved after 15 minutes after completion of the oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate unit (30 minutes after the start of the unit), patients may take <span class="Bold">ONLY ONE</span> additional dose using the same strength for that episode. Thus patients should take a maximum of two doses of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for any episode of breakthrough pain.</p><p>b.     Patients MUST wait <span class="Bold">at least 4 hours</span> before treating another episode of breakthrough pain with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate.</p><h3>Dose Titration</h3><p class="First">From an initial dose, closely follow patients and change the dosage strength until the patient reaches a dose that provides adequate analgesia using a single oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate dosage unit per breakthrough cancer pain episode. If signs of excessive opioid effects appear before the unit is consumed, the dosage unit should be removed from the patient’s mouth immediately, disposed of properly, and subsequent doses should be decreased. Patients should record their use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate over several episodes of breakthrough cancer pain and review their experience with their physicians to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted.</p><p>In cases where the breakthrough pain episode is not relieved 15 minutes after completion of the oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate unit (30 minutes after the start of the unit), patients may take <span class="Bold">ONLY ONE</span> additional dose of the same strength for that episode. Thus, patients should take a maximum of two doses of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for any breakthrough pain episode.</p><p>Patients must wait <span class="Bold">at least 4 hours</span> before treating another episode of breakthrough pain with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. To reduce the risk of overdosing during titration, patients should have only one strength of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate available at any one time.</p><h3>Maintenance Dosing</h3><p class="First">a.    Once titrated to an effective dose, patients should generally use <span class="Bold">ONLY ONE</span> oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate unit of the appropriate strength per breakthrough pain episode.</p><p>b.    On those occasions when the breakthrough pain episode is not relieved 15 minutes after completion of the oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate unit, patient may take <span class="Bold">ONLY ONE</span> additional dose using the same strength for that episode.</p><p>c.    Patients MUST wait <span class="Bold">at least 4 hours</span> before treating another episode of breakthrough pain with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. Once a successful dose has been found (i.e., an average episode is treated with a single unit), patients should limit consumption to four or fewer units per day.</p><p>d.    Dosage adjustment of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate may be required in some patients in order to continue to provide adequate relief of breakthrough pain.</p><p>e.    Generally, the oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate dose should be increased only when a single administration of the current dose fails to adequately treat the breakthrough pain episode for several consecutive episodes.</p><p>f.     If the patient experiences greater than four breakthrough pain episodes per day, the dose of the maintenance (around-the-clock) opioid used for persistent pain should be re-evaluated.</p><h3>Administration of Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate</h3><p class="First">Open the blister package with scissors immediately prior to product use. The patient should place the oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate unit in his or her mouth between the cheek and lower gum, occasionally moving the drug matrix from one side to the other using the handle. The oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate unit should be sucked, not chewed. A unit dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, if chewed and swallowed, might result in lower peak concentrations and lower bioavailability than when consumed as directed <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>The oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate unit should be consumed over a 15-minute period. Longer or shorter consumption times may produce less efficacy than reported in oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate clinical trials. If signs of excessive opioid effects appear before the unit is consumed, remove the drug matrix from the patient’s mouth immediately and decrease future doses.</p><h3>Discontinuation of Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate</h3><p class="First">When opioid therapy is no longer required, consider discontinuing oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate along with a gradual downward of other opioids to minimize possible withdrawal effects. In patients who continue to take their chronic opioid therapy for persistent pain but no longer require treatment for breakthrough pain, oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate therapy can usually be discontinued immediately <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Disposal of Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate</h3><p class="First">After consumption of the unit is complete and the matrix is totally dissolved, throw away the handle in a trash container that is out of the reach of children.</p><ul class="Disc">

Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>. Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate.</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate are essential <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>. Overestimating the oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate dosage can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. The substitution of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for any other fentanyl product may result in fatal overdose <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant.</span></p><p>Accidental ingestion of even one dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>.</span></p><h3>Increased Risk of Overdose in Children Due to Accidental Ingestion or Exposure</h3><p class="First">Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate.</p><p>Patients and their caregivers must be informed that oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Healthcare providers and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure.</p><p>Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><p>Detailed instructions for the proper storage, administration, disposal, and important instructions for managing an overdose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate are provided in the oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate <span class="Italics">Medication Guide</span>. Encourage patients to read this information in its entirety and give them an opportunity to have their questions answered.</p><h3>Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of fentanyl and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate-treated patients may increase fentanyl plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When using oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate-treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate until stable drug effects are achieved <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>Concomitant use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease fentanyl plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. When using oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants (including Alcohol)</h3><p class="First">Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Risk of Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">When prescribing, do not convert a patient to oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis.</p><p>Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is not a generic version of other transmucosal immediate release fentanyl (TIRF) formulations. <span class="Bold">When dispensing, do not substitute an oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate prescription for any other TIRF formulation under any circumstances. Other TIRF formulations and oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate are not equivalent.</span> Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate compared to other fentanyl products including other TIRF formulations that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose.</p><p><span class="Bold">There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.)</span> Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate should <span class="Bold">always</span> be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</h3><p class="First">Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate contains fentanyl, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]</span>.</p><p>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.</p><p>Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, and monitor all patients receiving oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><h3>Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program</h3><p class="First">Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)],</span> oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required.</p><p>Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>
<p class="First">Healthcare professionals, who prescribe oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">To receive oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">Pharmacies that dispense oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate must enroll in the program, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">Wholesalers and distributors that distribute oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate must enroll in the program, and distribute only to authorized pharmacies.</p>

Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</h3><p class="First">The use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease</span>: Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</span>: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate and when oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome with Concomitant Use of Serotonergic Drugs</h3><p class="First">Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with serotonergic drugs. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAO inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. This may occur within the recommended dosage range.</p><p>Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate if serotonin syndrome is suspected.</p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><h3>Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. In patients with circulatory shock, oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate in patients with circulatory shock.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness</h3><p class="First">In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate.</p><p>Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First">Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>The fentanyl in oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</h3><p class="First">The fentanyl in oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate therapy.</p><h3>Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery</h3><p class="First">Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate and know how they will react to the medication.</p><h3>Cardiac Disease</h3><p class="First">Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:</p><ul class="Disc">

The duration of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days.</p><p>The most serious adverse reactions associated with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock.</p><p>Because the clinical trials of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate therapy, or cancer-related symptoms.</p><p>Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies. Adverse reactions are listed in descending order of frequency within each body system.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1.<br/>

Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span>. Available data with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, fentanyl administration to pregnant rats during organogenesis was embryocidal at doses within the range of the human recommended dosing. When administered during gestation through lactation fentanyl administration to pregnant rats resulted in reduced pup survival at doses within the range of the human recommended dosing. No evidence of malformations were noted in animal studies completed to date <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</span><br/>
Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth.</p><p>Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset of neonatal withdrawal symptoms usually occurs in the first days after birth. The duration and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome may vary. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Labor or Delivery</span><br/>
Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor.</p><p>Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Human Data</span><br/>
In women treated acutely with intravenous or epidural fentanyl during labor, symptoms of neonatal respiratory or neurological depression were no more frequent than would be expected in infants of untreated mothers.</p><p>Transient neonatal muscular rigidity has been observed in infants whose mothers were treated with intravenous fentanyl.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span><br/>
Fentanyl (25, 50, or 100 mcg/kg) citrate was administered subcutaneously to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis (Gestation Day, GD 6 to 17). Maternal toxicity and a decrease in fetal weights were observed at 100 mcg/kg but no teratogenicity was seen in the study (the no observed effect level of 50 mcg/kg is equivalent to 0.7 times the exposure of a single human dose of 1600 mcg per pain episode, based on an AUC comparison). Fentanyl (50, 100, or 250 mcg/kg) was also administered subcutaneously to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis (GD 6 to 18). Maternal toxicity was noted at doses &gt;100 mcg/kg. No teratogenicity was seen in the study (250 mcg/kg dose is equivalent to 3.5 times the exposure of a single human dose of 1600 mcg per pain episode, based on an AUC comparison).</p><p>Fentanyl has been shown to embryocidal in pregnant rats at doses of 30 mcg/kg intravenously (0.2 times the 1600 mcg dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) from GD 6 to 18 and 160 mcg/kg subcutaneously (1 times the 1600 mcg dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate based on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). No evidence of teratogenicity was reported.</p><p>No evidence of malformations or adverse effects on the fetus was reported in a published study in which pregnant rats were administered fentanyl continuously via subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps at doses of 10, 100, or 500 mcg/kg/day starting 2-weeks prior to breeding and throughout pregnancy. The high dose was approximately 3 times the human dose of 1600 mcg oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate per pain episode on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis and produced mean steady-state plasma levels that are 3.4 times higher than the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> observed following administration of 1600 mcg dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate in humans.</p><p>In a postnatal development study, pregnant rats were treated from GD 6 through Lactation Day (LD) 20 with subcutaneous doses of fentanyl (25, 50, 100, and 400 mcg/kg). Maternal toxicity was noted at doses &gt;100 mcg/kg. A reduction in pup growth and delayed attainment of developmental indices were observed at &gt;100 mcg/kg. No difference in the number of live pups/litter was seen at birth, however, pup survival at LD 4 was reduced to 48% at 400 mcg/kg and by LD 21 pup survival was reduced to 30% and 26% at 100 and 400 mcg/kg, respectively. During lactation, fentanyl-related clinical signs (decreased activity, skin cold to touch, and moribund appearance) were noted in the F1 pups, most prominently in the 400 mcg/kg group. Pups from this group also had significantly reduced body weights throughout the lactation period. The dose of fentanyl administered to rats at which no developmental toxicity in the F1 generation was seen was 50 mcg/kg which is 0.6 times the exposure of a single human dose of 1600 mcg per pain episode, based on an AUC comparison.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
Fentanyl is present in breast milk. One published lactation study reports a relative infant dose of fentanyl of 0.024%. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of fentanyl on the breastfed infant and the effects of fentanyl on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span><br/>
Monitor infants exposed to oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infertility</span><br/>
Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below 16 years of age have not been established.</p><p>In a clinical study, 15 opioid-tolerant pediatric patients with breakthrough pain, ranging in age from 5 to 15 years, were treated with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. The study was too small to allow conclusions on safety and efficacy in this patient population. Twelve of the fifteen opioid-tolerant children and adolescents aged 5 to 15 years in this study received oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate at doses ranging from 200 mcg to 600 mcg. The mean (CV%; range) dose-normalized (to 200 mcg) C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-8</span> values were 0.87 ng/mL (51%; 0.42-1.30) and 4.54 ng•h/mL (42%; 2.37-6.0), respectively, for children ages 5 to &lt;11 years old (N = 3) and 0.68 ng/mL (72%; 0.15-1.44) and 8.38 (192%; 0.84-50.78), respectively, for children ages ≥11 to &lt;16 y (N = 9).</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 257 patients in clinical studies of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate in breakthrough cancer pain, 61 (24%) were 65 years of age and older, while 15 (6%) were 75 years of age and older. Those patients over the age of 65 years were titrated to a mean dose that was about 200 mcg less than the mean dose titrated to by younger patients. No difference was noted in the safety profile of the group over 65 years of age as compared to younger patients in oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate clinical trials.</p><p>Elderly patients have been shown to be more sensitive to the effects of fentanyl when administered intravenously, compared with the younger population. Therefore, exercise caution when individually titrating oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate in elderly patients to provide adequate efficacy while minimizing risk.</p><p>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]</span>.</p><p>Fentanyl is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h3>Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Insufficient information exists to make recommendations regarding the use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Fentanyl is metabolized primarily via human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system and mostly eliminated in urine. If the drug is used in these patients, it should be used with caution because of the hepatic metabolism and renal excretion of fentanyl.</p><h3>Sex</h3><p class="First">Both male and female opioid-tolerant cancer patients were studied for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain. No clinically relevant sex differences were noted either in dosage requirement or in observed adverse reactions.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate contains fentanyl, a Schedule II controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate contains fentanyl, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p><p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</p><p>“Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks Specific to the Abuse of Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate</span><br/>
Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is for oral transmucosal use only. Abuse of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p><p>Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span><br/>
Acute overdose with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment of Overdose</span><br/>
In case of overdose, priorities are: removal of the oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate unit, if still in the mouth, the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to fentanyl overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to fentanyl overdose.</p><p>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of fentanyl in oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.</p><p>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p><h2>Fentanyl Lozenge Description</h2><p class="First">Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate lozenge is a solid formulation of fentanyl, an opioid agonist, intended for oral transmucosal administration. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is formulated as a white to off-white solid drug matrix on a handle that is fracture resistant (ABS plastic) under normal conditions when used as directed.</p><p>Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is designed to be dissolved slowly in the mouth to facilitate transmucosal absorption. The handle allows the oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate unit to be removed from the mouth if signs of excessive opioid effects appear during administration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Active Ingredient</span>: Fentanyl citrate USP is N-(1-Phenethyl-4-piperidyl) propionanilide citrate (1:1). Fentanyl is a highly lipophilic compound (octanol-water partition coefficient at pH 7.4 is 816:1) that is freely soluble in organic solvents and sparingly soluble in water (1:40). The molecular weight of the free base is 336.5 (the citrate salt is 528.6). The pKa of the tertiary nitrogens are 7.3 and 8.4. The compound has the following structural formula:</p><p><span class="Bold">Inactive Ingredients</span>: Raspberry flavor, citric acid, confectioners sugar, dextrates, magnesium stearate, dibasic sodium phosphate, modified food starch, ethanol, water, purified shellac, propylene glycol, FD&amp;C blue no. 1, ammonium hydroxide.</p><h2>Fentanyl Lozenge - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Fentanyl is an opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on the</span> <span class="Bold">Central Nervous System</span><br/>
The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown although fentanyl is known to be a <span class="Italics">mu</span>-opioid receptor agonist. Specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.</p><p>Fentanyl produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem to both increases in carbon dioxide and electrical stimulation.</p><p>Fentanyl causes miosis even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span><br/>
Fentanyl causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and in the duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span><br/>
Fentanyl may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Fentanyl produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the</span> <span class="Bold">Endocrine System</span><br/>
Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.  They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) has been shown to be both inhibited and stimulated by opioids.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Immune System</span><br/>
Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.</p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration-Efficacy Relationships</span><br/>
The analgesic effects of fentanyl are related to the blood level of the drug, if proper allowance is made for the delay into and out of the CNS (a process with a 3- to 5-minute half-life).</p><p>In general, the effective concentration and the concentration at which toxicity occurs increase with increasing tolerance with any and all opioids. The rate of development of tolerance varies widely among individuals.</p><p>The minimum effective analgesic concentration of fentanyl for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome and/or the development of analgesic tolerance.</p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration-Adverse Reaction Relationships</span><br/>
There is a relationship between increasing fentanyl plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Respiratory System</span><br/>
All opioid <span class="Italics">mu</span>-receptor agonists, including fentanyl, produce dose-dependent respiratory depression. The risk of respiratory depression is less in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy who develop tolerance to respiratory depression and other opioid effects. During the titration phase of the clinical trials, somnolence, which may be a precursor to respiratory depression, did increase in patients who were treated with higher doses of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. Peak respiratory depressive effects may be seen as early as 15 to 30 minutes from the start of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate product administration and may persist for several hours.</p><p>Serious or fatal respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses. Although not observed with oral transmucosal fentanyl products in clinical trials, fentanyl given rapidly by intravenous injection in large doses may interfere with respiration by causing rigidity in the muscles of respiration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4), Adverse Reactions (6), and Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span><br/>
The absorption pharmacokinetics of fentanyl from the oral transmucosal dosage form is a combination of an initial rapid absorption from the buccal mucosa and a more prolonged absorption of swallowed fentanyl from the GI tract. Both the blood fentanyl profile and the bioavailability of fentanyl will vary depending on the fraction of the dose that is absorbed through the oral mucosa and the fraction swallowed.</p><p>Absolute bioavailability, as determined by area under the concentration-time curve, of 15 mcg/kg in 12 adult males was 50% compared to intravenous fentanyl.</p><p>Normally, approximately 25% of the total dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is rapidly absorbed from the buccal mucosa and becomes systemically available. The remaining 75% of the total dose is swallowed with the saliva and then is slowly absorbed from the GI tract. About 1/3 of this amount (25% of the total dose) escapes hepatic and intestinal first-pass elimination and becomes systemically available. Thus, the generally observed 50% bioavailability of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is divided equally between rapid transmucosal and slower GI absorption. Therefore, a unit dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, if chewed and swallowed, might result in lower peak concentrations and lower bioavailability than when consumed as directed.</p><p>Dose proportionality among four of the available strengths of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (200, 400, 800, and 1600 mcg) has been demonstrated in a balanced crossover design in adult subjects (n=11). Mean serum fentanyl levels following these four doses of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate are shown in Figure 1. The curves for each dose level are similar in shape with increasing dose levels producing increasing serum fentanyl levels. C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0→∞</span> increased in a dose-dependent manner that is approximately proportional to the oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate administered.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1.<br/>

Fentanyl is highly lipophilic. Animal data showed that following absorption, fentanyl is rapidly distributed to the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys and spleen followed by a slower redistribution to muscles and fat. The plasma protein binding of fentanyl is 80 to 85%. The main binding protein is alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, but both albumin and lipoproteins contribute to some extent. The free fraction of fentanyl increases with acidosis. The mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was 4 L/kg.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span><br/>
The total plasma clearance of fentanyl was 0.5 L/hr/kg (range 0.3 to 0.7 L/hr/kg). The terminal elimination half-life after oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate administration is about 7 hours.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Fentanyl is metabolized in the liver and in the intestinal mucosa to norfentanyl by cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform. Norfentanyl was not found to be pharmacologically active in animal studies <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Fentanyl is primarily (more than 90%) eliminated by biotransformation to N-dealkylated and hydroxylated inactive metabolites. Less than 7% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, and only about 1% is excreted unchanged in the feces. The metabolites are mainly excreted in the urine, while fecal excretion is less important.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span><br/>
Fentanyl was evaluated for carcinogenic potential in a 104-week rat study and in a 6-month Tg.AC transgenic mouse study. In rats, doses up to 50 mcg/kg in males and 100 mcg/kg in females were administered subcutaneously and no treatment-related neoplasms were observed (doses are equivalent to 1.13 and 2.7 times the exposure of a single human dose of 1600 mcg per pain episode, respectively, based on an AUC comparison). In a 26-week transgenic mice model (Tg.AC), at topical doses up to 50 mcg/dose/day, no increase in the occurrence of treatment-related neoplasms was observed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span><br/>
Fentanyl citrate was not mutagenic in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ames reverse mutation assay in <span class="Italics">S. typhimurium</span> or <span class="Italics">E. coli</span>, or the mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay, and was not clastogenic in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span><br/>
In a fertility study, female rats were administered fentanyl subcutaneously for 14 days prior to mating with untreated males at doses up to 300 mcg/kg and no effects on female fertility were observed. The systemic exposure at the dose of 300 mcg/kg was approximately 4.0 times the exposure of a single human dose of 1600 mcg per pain episode, based on an AUC comparison. Males were administered fentanyl subcutaneously for 28 days prior to mating with untreated females at doses up to 300 mcg/kg. At 300 mcg/kg, adverse effects on sperm parameters, which affected fertility, were observed. These effects included decreased percent mobile sperm, decreased sperm concentrations as well as an increase in the percent abnormal sperm. The dose in males at which no effects on fertility were observed was 100 mcg/kg, which is approximately 2.7 times the exposure of a single human dose of 1600 mcg per pain episode, based on an AUC comparison.</p><p>Fentanyl has been shown to impair fertility in rats at doses of 30 mcg/kg IV and 160 mcg/kg subcutaneously. Conversion to the human equivalent doses indicates that this is within the range of the human recommended dosing for oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate was investigated in clinical trials involving 257 opioid tolerant adult cancer patients experiencing breakthrough cancer pain. Breakthrough cancer pain was defined as a transient flare of moderate-to-severe pain occurring in cancer patients experiencing persistent cancer pain otherwise controlled with maintenance doses of opioid medications including at least 60 mg morphine/day, 50 mcg transdermal fentanyl/hour, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week or longer.</p><p>In two dose titration studies 95 of 127 patients (75%) who were on stable doses of either long-acting oral opioids or transdermal fentanyl for their persistent cancer pain titrated to a successful dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate to treat their breakthrough cancer pain within the dose range offered (200, 400, 600, 800, 1200, and 1600 mcg). A “successful” dose was defined as a dose where one unit of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate could be used consistently for at least two consecutive days to treat breakthrough cancer pain without unacceptable side effects. In these studies 11% of patients withdrew due to adverse reactions and 14% withdrew due to other reasons.</p><p>The successful dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for breakthrough cancer pain was not predicted from the daily maintenance dose of opioid used to manage the persistent cancer pain and is thus best determined by dose titration.</p><p>A double-blind placebo controlled crossover study was performed in cancer patients to evaluate the effectiveness of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain. Of 130 patients who entered the study 92 patients (71%) achieved a successful dose during the titration phase. The distribution of successful doses is shown in Table 5.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 5</span><span class="Bold">.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Successful Dose of</span> <span class="Bold">Oral Transmucosal </span><span class="Bold">Fentanyl Citrate Following Initial Titration</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Oral Transmucosal<br/>
