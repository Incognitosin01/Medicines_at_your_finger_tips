Insulin is one of many hormones that help the body turn the food we eat into energy. This is done by using the glucose (sugar) in the blood as quick energy. Also, insulin helps us store energy that we can use later. When you have diabetes mellitus, your body cannot make enough insulin or does not use insulin properly. This causes you to have too much sugar in your blood. Like other types of insulin, insulin degludec is used to keep your blood sugar level close to normal. Liraglutide is to be used when diet and exercise do not result in good blood sugar control.</p><p>Insulin degludec and liraglutide is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using insulin degludec and liraglutide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For insulin degludec and liraglutide, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to insulin degludec and liraglutide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of insulin degludec and liraglutide combination injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of insulin degludec and liraglutide combination injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related hypoglycemia, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving insulin degludec and liraglutide.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking insulin degludec and liraglutide, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using insulin degludec and liraglutide with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of insulin degludec and liraglutide</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional may give you insulin degludec and liraglutide. You may also be taught how to give your medicine at home. Insulin degludec and liraglutide is given as a shot under the skin of your stomach, thigh, or upper arm.</p><p>Always double-check both the concentration (strength) of your insulin <i>and</i> your dose. <i>Concentration and dose are not the same</i>. The dose is how many units of insulin you will use. The concentration tells how many units of insulin are in each milliliter (mL), such as 100 units/mL (U-100), but this does not mean you will use 100 units at a time.</p><p>Each package of insulin degludec and liraglutide combination injection contains a patient information sheet. Read this sheet carefully and make sure you understand:</p><ul>
<li>How to prepare the medicine.</li>
<li>How to inject the medicine.</li>
<li>How to dispose of syringes, needles, and injection devices.</li>
</ul><p>If you use insulin degludec and liraglutide at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. Do <i>not</i> use the exact same spot for each injection. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections.</p><p>Since insulin degludec and liraglutide lowers the blood glucose over 24 hours, it is best to use it at about the same time every day.</p><p>Check the liquid in the pen. It should look clear and colorless. Do not use insulin degludec and liraglutide if it looks cloudy, thick, or discolored, or if it has particles in it. Do not mix insulin degludec and liraglutide with any other insulin or liquids. Do not use insulin degludec and liraglutide in an insulin infusion pump.</p><p><i>Follow carefully the special meal plan your doctor gave you</i>. This is the most important part of controlling your condition, and is necessary if the medicine is to work properly. Also, exercise regularly and test for sugar in your blood or urine as directed.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of insulin degludec and liraglutide will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of insulin degludec and liraglutide. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.</p><p>If you miss a dose of insulin degludec and liraglutide for <i>more than 3 days</i>, call your doctor to talk about how to restart your treatment.</p><h3>Storage</h3><p>Keep out of the reach of children.</p><p>Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.</p><p>Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.</p><p>Store your <i>new, unused</i> medicine pen in the refrigerator, in the original carton, and protect it from light. Do not freeze. Do not use the medicine if it has been frozen. You may store the <i>opened</i> medicine pen in the refrigerator or at room temperature for 21 days. Throw away any unused medicine after 21 days.</p><p>Throw away used needles in a hard, closed container that the needles cannot poke through. Keep this container away from children and pets.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using insulin degludec and liraglutide</h2><p><i>Never share insulin pens with others under any circumstances</i>. It is not safe for one pen to be used for more than one person. Sharing needles or pens can result in transmission of hepatitis viruses, HIV, or other bloodborne illnesses.</p><p><i>Your doctor will want to check your progress at regular visits</i>, especially during the first few weeks you take insulin degludec and liraglutide. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>It is very important to follow carefully any instructions from your health care team about:</p><ul>
<li>Alcohol—Drinking alcohol may cause severe low blood sugar. Discuss this with your health care team.</li>
<li>Other medicines—Do not take other medicines during the time you are using insulin degludec and liraglutide combination unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes nonprescription medicines such as aspirin, and medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems.</li>
<li>Counseling—Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Also, patients with diabetes may need special counseling about diabetes medicine dosing changes that might occur because of lifestyle changes, such as changes in exercise and diet. Furthermore, counseling on contraception and pregnancy may be needed because of the problems that can occur in patients with diabetes during pregnancy.</li>
<li>Travel—Keep a recent prescription and your medical history with you. Be prepared for an emergency as you would normally. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times.</li>
</ul><p>In case of emergency—There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to:</p><ul>
<li>Wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says that you have diabetes and a list of all of your medicines.</li>
<li>Keep an extra supply of Xultophy® and syringes with needles or injection devices on hand in case high blood sugar occurs.</li>
<li>Keep some kind of quick-acting sugar handy to treat low blood sugar.</li>
<li>Have a glucagon kit and a syringe and needle available in case severe low blood sugar occurs. Check and replace any expired kits regularly.</li>
</ul><p>Too much of insulin degludec and liraglutide can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Low blood sugar also can occur if you use insulin degludec and liraglutide with another antidiabetic medicine, changes in insulin regimen (eg, insulin strength, type of insulin, injection site), delay or miss a meal or snack, exercise more than usual, or drink alcohol. <i>Symptoms of low blood sugar must be treated before they lead to unconsciousness (passing out)</i>. Different people may feel different symptoms of low blood sugar. It is important that you learn which symptoms of low blood sugar you usually have so that you can treat it quickly.</p><p><i>Symptoms of low blood sugar</i> include anxiety, behavior change similar to being drunk, blurred vision, cold sweats, confusion, difficulty in thinking, dizziness or lightheadedness, drowsiness, excessive hunger, fast heartbeat, headache, irritability or abnormal behavior, nervousness, nightmares, restless sleep, shakiness, slurred speech, and tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or tongue.</p><p>If symptoms of low blood sugar occur, eat glucose tablets or gel, corn syrup, honey, or sugar cubes, or drink fruit juice, non diet soft drink, or sugar dissolved in water to relieve the symptoms. Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Get to a doctor or a hospital right away if the symptoms do not improve. Someone should call for emergency help immediately if severe symptoms such as convulsions (seizures) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe and needle, and know how to use it. Members of your household also should know how to use it.</p><p>Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur if you do not take enough or skip a dose of your antidiabetic medicine or insulin, changes in insulin regimen, you overeat or do not follow your meal plan, have a fever or infection, or do not exercise as much as usual.</p><p><i>Symptoms of high blood sugar</i> include: blurred vision, drowsiness, dry mouth, flushed, dry skin, fruit-like breath odor, increased urination, ketones in the urine, loss of appetite, stomachache, nausea or vomiting, tiredness, troubled breathing (rapid and deep), unconsciousness, and unusual thirst.</p><p>If symptoms of high blood sugar occur, check your blood sugar level and then call your doctor for instructions.</p><p>Insulin degludec and liraglutide can cause low blood sugar. <i>Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how insulin degludec and liraglutide affects you</i>.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have the following symptoms while using insulin degludec and liraglutide: a mass in the neck, difficulty with swallowing, hoarseness, or troubled breathing. These may be symptoms of a serious thyroid problem.</p><p>Pancreatitis may occur while you are using insulin degludec and liraglutide. Tell your doctor right away if you have sudden and severe stomach pain, chills, constipation, nausea, vomiting, fever, or lightheadedness.</p><p>Insulin degludec and liraglutide may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, swelling of the face, tongue, and throat, trouble breathing, or chest pain after you receive the medicine.</p><p>Insulin degludec and liraglutide may cause low levels of potassium in your blood. <i>Do not use medicines, supplements, or salt substitutes that contain potassium unless you have discussed this with your doctor</i>.</p><p>Using insulin degludec and liraglutide together with other diabetes medicine (eg, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, Actos®, Actoplus Met®, Avandia®) may cause serious heart problems or edema (fluid retention). Check with your doctor immediately if you are rapidly gaining weight, having chest pain or discomfort, extreme tiredness or weakness, trouble breathing, uneven heartbeat, or excessive swelling of the hands, wrist, ankles, or feet.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Insulin degludec and liraglutide side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
