</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Budesonide and Formoterol Aerosol</h2><h3>Treatment of Asthma</h3><p class="First">BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 6 years of age and older.</p><p>BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL should be used for patients not adequately controlled on a long-term asthma-control medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or whose disease warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA).</p><p><span class="Bold">Important Limitations of Use:</span></p><h3>Maintenance Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</h3><p class="First">BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL 160/4.5 is indicated for the maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL 160/4.5 is also indicated to reduce exacerbations of COPD. BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL 160/4.5 is the only strength indicated for the treatment of COPD.</p><p><span class="Bold">Important Limitations of Use:</span></p><h2>Budesonide and Formoterol Aerosol Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Administration Information</h3><p class="First">BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL should be administered as 2 inhalations twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart), every day by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, the patient should rinse the mouth with water without swallowing.</p><p>Prime BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL before using for the first time by releasing two test sprays into the air away from the face, shaking well for 5 seconds before each spray. In cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 7 days or when it has been dropped, prime the inhaler again by shaking well before each spray and releasing two test sprays into the air away from the face.</p><p>More frequent administration or a higher number of inhalations (more than 2 inhalations twice daily) of the prescribed strength of BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL is not recommended as some patients are more likely to experience adverse effects with higher doses of formoterol. Patients using BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL should not use additional LABA for any reason <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.12)</span>].</p><h3>Asthma</h3><p class="First">If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist should be taken for immediate relief.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age and Older</span></p><p>For patients 12 years of age and older, the dosage is 2 inhalations of BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL 80/4.5 or BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL 160/4.5 twice daily.</p><p>The recommended starting dosages for BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL for patients 12 years of age and older are based upon patients' asthma severity or level of control of asthma symptoms, and risk of exacerbations on current inhaled corticosteroids.</p><p>The maximum recommended dosage in adult and adolescent patients 12 years and older is BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL 160/4.5, two inhalations twice daily.</p><p>Improvement in asthma control following inhaled administration of BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL can occur within 15 minutes of beginning treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 2 weeks or longer after beginning treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief.</p><p>For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose after 1-2 weeks of therapy with BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL 80/4.5, replacement with BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL 160/4.5 may provide additional asthma control.</p><p>If a previously effective dosage regimen of BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options, (e.g., replacing the lower strength of BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL with the higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, or initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients Aged 6 to Less than 12 Years</span></p><p>For patients 6 to less than 12 years of age, the dosage is 2 inhalations of BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL 80/4.5 twice daily.</p><h3>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</h3><p class="First">For patients with COPD the recommended dose is BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL 160/4.5, two inhalations twice daily.</p><p>If shortness of breath occurs in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist should be taken for immediate relief.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL is available as a metered-dose inhaler containing a combination of budesonide (80 or 160 mcg) and formoterol (4.5 mcg) as an inhalation aerosol in the following two strengths: 80/4.5 and 160/4.5. Each dosage strength contains 120 actuations per/canister. Each strength of BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL is supplied with a red plastic actuator with a gray dust cap.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">The use of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate is contraindicated in the following conditions:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Serious Asthma-Related Events – Hospitalizations, Intubations and Death</h3><p class="First">Use of LABA as monotherapy (without ICS) for asthma is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death [see <span class="Italics">Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART)</span>]. Available data from controlled clinical trials also suggest that use of LABA as monotherapy increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. These findings are considered a class effect of LABA. When LABA are used in fixed-dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared to ICS alone (see <span class="Italics">Serious Asthma-Related Events with ICS/LABA</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold">Serious Asthma-Related Events with ICS/LABA</span></p><p>Four large, 26-week, randomized, blinded, active-controlled clinical safety trials were conducted to evaluate the risk of serious asthma-related events when LABA were used in fixed-dose combination with ICS compared to ICS alone in patients with asthma. Three trials included adult and adolescent patients aged ≥12 years: one trial compared budesonide/formoterol (budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate) to budesonide <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>; one trial compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder to fluticasone propionate inhalation powder; and one trial compared mometasone furoate/formoterol to mometasone furoate. The fourth trial included pediatric patients 4 to 11 years of age and compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder to fluticasone propionate inhalation powder. The primary safety endpoint for all four trials was serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations and death). A blinded adjudication committee determined whether events were asthma-related.</p><p>The three adult and adolescent trials were designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.0, and the pediatric trial was designed to rule out a risk of 2.7. Each individual trial met its pre-specified objective and demonstrated non-inferiority of ICS/LABA to ICS alone. A meta-analysis of the three adult and adolescent trials did not show a significant increase in risk of a serious asthma-related event with ICS/LABA fixed-dose combination compared with ICS alone (Table 1). These trials were not designed to rule out all risk for serious asthma-related events with ICS/LABA compared with ICS.</p><p class="First">ICS/LABA</p><p>(N = 17,537)*</p><p class="First">ICS</p><p>(N = 17,552)*</p><p class="First">ICS/LABA vs ICS</p><p>Hazard ratio (95% CI)†</p><p class="First">Serious asthma-related event‡</p><p class="First">116</p><p class="First">105</p><p class="First">1.10 (0.85, 1.44)</p><p class="First">Asthma-related death</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">Asthma-related intubation (endotracheal)</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">Asthma-related hospitalization (≥24-hour stay)</p><p class="First">115</p><p class="First">105</p><p class="First">ICS = Inhaled Corticosteroid, LABA = Long-acting Beta2-adrenergic Agonist</p><p>The pediatric safety trial included 6208 pediatric patients 4 to 11 years of age who received ICS/LABA (fluticasone propionate /salmeterol inhalation powder) or ICS (fluticasone propionate inhalation powder). In this trial, 27/3107 (0.9%) patients randomized to ICS/LABA and 21/3101 (0.7%) patients randomized to ICS experienced a serious asthma-related event. There were no asthma-related deaths or intubations. ICS/LABA did not show a significantly increased risk of a serious asthma-related event compared to ICS based on the pre-specified risk margin (2.7), with an estimated hazard ratio of time to first event of 1.29 (95% CI: 0.73, 2.27).</p><p><span class="Bold">Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART)</span></p><p>A 28-week, placebo-controlled U.S. trial that compared the safety of salmeterol with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in patients treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in patients treated with placebo; relative risk: 4.37 [95% CI 1.25, 15.34]). Use of background ICS was not required in SMART. The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Formoterol Monotherapy Studies</span></p><p>Clinical studies with formoterol used as monotherapy suggested a higher incidence of serious asthma exacerbation in patients who received formoterol than in those who received placebo. The sizes of these studies were not adequate to precisely quantify the difference in serious asthma exacerbations between treatment groups.</p><h3>Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes</h3><p class="First">Budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of asthma or COPD. Budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate has not been studied in patients with acutely deteriorating asthma or COPD. The initiation of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate in this setting is not appropriate.</p><p>Increasing use of inhaled, short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma. In this situation, the patient requires immediate re-evaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for replacing the current strength of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate with a higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, or initiating systemic corticosteroids. Patients should not use more than 2 inhalations twice daily (morning and evening) of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate.</p><p>Budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. An inhaled, short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist, not budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath.</p><p>When beginning treatment with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs.</p><h3>Excessive Use of Budesonide and Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate and Use with Other Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists</h3><p class="First">As with other inhaled drugs containing beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic agents, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medications containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate should not use an additional LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate) for any reason, including prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) or the treatment of asthma or COPD.</p><h3>Local Effects</h3><p class="First">In clinical studies, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with <span class="Italics">Candida albicans</span> has occurred in patients treated with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral antifungal) therapy while treatment with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate continues, but at times therapy with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing following inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.</p><h3>Pneumonia and Other Lower Respiratory Tract Infections</h3><p class="First">Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbations frequently overlap. Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, have been reported following the inhaled administration of corticosteroids.</p><p>In a 6-month lung function study of 1704 patients with COPD, there was a higher incidence of lung infections other than pneumonia (e.g., bronchitis, viral lower respiratory tract infections, etc.) in patients receiving budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5 (7.6%) than in those receiving budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 80/4.5 (3.2%), formotero1 4.5 mcg (4.6%) or placebo (3.3%). Pneumonia did not occur with greater incidence in the budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5 group (1.1 %) compared with placebo (1.3%). In a 12-month lung function study of 1964 patients with COPD, there was also a higher incidence of lung infections other than pneumonia in patients receiving budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5 (8.1%) than in those receiving budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 80/4.5 (6.9%), formoterol 4.5 mcg (7.1%) or placebo (6.2%). Similar to the 6-month study, pneumonia did not occur with greater incidence in the budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5 group (4.0%) compared with placebo (5.0%).</p><h3>Immunosuppression</h3><p class="First">Patients who are on drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affects the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated (see the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information). If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. The immune responsiveness to varicella vaccine was evaluated in pediatric patients with asthma ages 12 months to 8 years with budesonide inhalation suspension.</p><p>An open-label, nonrandomized clinical study examined the immune responsiveness to varicella vaccine in 243 asthma patients 12 months to 8 years of age who were treated with budesonide inhalation suspension 0.25 mg to 1 mg daily (n=151) or noncorticosteroid asthma therapy (n=92) (i.e., beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, cromones). The percentage of patients developing a seroprotective antibody titer of <span class="Bold">&gt;</span>5.0 (gpELISA value) in response to the vaccination was similar in patients treated with budesonide inhalation suspension (85%), compared to patients treated with noncorticosteroid asthma therapy (90%). No patient treated with budesonide inhalation suspension developed chicken pox as a result of vaccination.</p><p>Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.</p><h3>Transferring Patients From Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy</h3><p class="First">Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.</p><p>Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate may provide control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.</p><p>During periods of stress, a severe asthma attack or a severe COPD exacerbation, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress, a severe asthma attack, or a severe COPD exacerbation.</p><p>Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>] or morning peak expiratory flow [PEF]), beta-agonist use, and asthma or COPD symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.</p><p>Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to inhaled corticosteroids or budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate may unmask conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions). Some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.</p><h3>Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression</h3><p class="First">Budesonide, a component of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, will often help control asthma and COPD symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since budesonide is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose.</p><p>Because of the possibility of systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.</p><p>It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients, particularly when budesonide is administered at higher than recommended doses over prolonged periods of time. If such effects occur, the dosage of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids and for management of asthma symptoms.</p><h3>Drug Interactions With Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate with ketoconazole, and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) because adverse effects related to increased systemic exposure to budesonide may occur <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms</h3><p class="First">As with other inhaled medications, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator, BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL should be discontinued immediately, and alternative therapy should be instituted.</p><h3>Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, as demonstrated by cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, and bronchospasm.</p><h3>Cardiovascular and Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">Excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation has been associated with seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>. Therefore, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, like all products containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.</p><p>Formoterol, a component of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of formoterol at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce ECG changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.</p><h3>Reduction in Bone Mineral Density</h3><p class="First">Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. Since patients with COPD often have multiple risk factors for reduced BMD, assessment of BMD is recommended prior to initiating budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate and periodically thereafter. If significant reductions in BMD are seen and budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate is still considered medically important for that patient's COPD therapy, use of medication to treat or prevent osteoporosis should be strongly considered.</p><p>Effects of treatment with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 80/4.5, formoterol 4.5 mcg, or placebo on BMD was evaluated in a subset of 326 patients (females and males 41 to 88 years of age) with COPD in the 12-month lung function study. BMD evaluations of the hip and lumbar spine regions were conducted at baseline and 52 weeks using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans. Mean changes in BMD from baseline to end of treatment were small (mean changes ranged from -0.01 - 0.01 g/cm<span class="Sup">2</span>). ANCOVA results for total spine and total hip BMD based on the end of treatment time point showed that all geometric LS Mean ratios for the pairwise treatment group comparisons were close to 1, indicating that overall, BMD for total hip and total spine regions for the 12-month time point were stable over the entire treatment period.</p><h3>Effect on Growth</h3><p class="First">Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, titrate each patient's dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Glaucoma and Cataracts</h3><p class="First">Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients with asthma and COPD following the long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide, a component of BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.</p><p>Effects of treatment with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 80/4.5, formoterol 4.5 mcg, or placebo on development of cataracts or glaucoma were evaluated in a subset of 461 patients with COPD in the 12-month lung function study. Ophthalmic examinations were conducted at baseline, 24 weeks, and 52 weeks. There were 26 subjects (6%) with an increase in posterior subcapsular score from baseline to maximum value (&gt;0.7) during the randomized treatment period. Changes in posterior subcapsular scores of &gt;0.7 from baseline to treatment maximum occurred in 11 patients (9.0%) in the budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5 group, 4 patients (3.8%) in the budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 80/4.5 group, 5 patients (4.2%) in the formoterol group, and 6 patients (5.2%) in the placebo group.</p><h3>Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome</h3><p class="First">In rare cases, patients on inhaled corticosteroids may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of inhaled corticosteroids. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between budesonide and these underlying conditions has not been established.</p><h3>Coexisting Conditions</h3><p class="First">Budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, like all medications containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines.

No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate.</p><h3>Inhibitors of Cytochrome P4503A4</h3><p class="First">The main route of metabolism of corticosteroids, including budesonide, a component of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, is via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4). After oral administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, the mean plasma concentration of orally administered budesonide increased. Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 may inhibit the metabolism of, and increase the systemic exposure to, budesonide. Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]</span>.</p><h3>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants</h3><p class="First">Budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate should be administered with caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of formoterol, a component of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, on the vascular system may be potentiated by these agents. In clinical trials with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, a limited number of COPD and asthma patients received tricyclic antidepressants, and, therefore, no clinically meaningful conclusions on adverse events can be made.</p><h3>Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blocking Agents</h3><p class="First">Beta-blockers (including eye drops) may not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as formoterol, a component of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, but may produce severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.</p><h3>Diuretics</h3><p class="First">The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate with non-potassium-sparing diuretics.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate or one of its individual components, formoterol fumarate, in pregnant women; however studies are available for the other component budesonide. In animal reproduction studies, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, administered by the inhalation route, was teratogenic, embryocidal, and reduced fetal weights in rats at less than the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID) on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Budesonide alone, administered by the subcutaneous route, was teratogenic, embryocidal, and reduced fetal weights in rats and rabbits at less than the MRHDID, but these effects were not seen in rats that received inhaled doses up to 4 times the MRHDID. Studies of pregnant women have not shown that inhaled budesonide alone increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during pregnancy. Experience with oral corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroid exposure than humans. Formoterol fumarate alone, administered by the oral route, was teratogenic in rats and rabbits at 1600 and 65,000 times the MRHDID, respectively. Formoterol fumarate was also embryocidal, increased pup loss at birth and during lactation, and decreased pup weight in rats at 110 times the MRHDID. These adverse effects generally occurred at large multiples of the MRHDID when formoterol fumarate was administered by the oral route to achieve high systemic exposures. No teratogenic, embryocidal, or developmental effects were seen in rats that received inhalation doses up to 375 times the MRHDID.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal risk</span></p><p>In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma, there is an increased risk of several perinatal adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age in the neonate. Pregnant women with asthma should be closely monitored and medication adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal asthma control.</p><p><span class="Italics">Labor or Delivery</span></p><p>There are no well-controlled human studies that have investigated the effects of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate during labor and delivery. Because of the potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine contractility, use of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Studies of pregnant women have not shown that inhaled budesonide increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during pregnancy. The results from a large population-based prospective cohort epidemiological study reviewing data from three Swedish registries covering approximately 99% of the pregnancies from 1995-1997 (i.e., Swedish Medical Birth Registry; Registry of Congenital Malformations; Child Cardiology Registry) indicate no increased risk for congenital malformations from the use of inhaled budesonide during early pregnancy. Congenital malformations were studied in 2014 infants born to mothers reporting the use of inhaled budesonide for asthma in early pregnancy (usually 10-12 weeks after the last menstrual period), the period when most major organ malformations occur. The rate of recorded congenital malformations was similar compared to the general population rate (3.8% vs. 3.5%, respectively). In addition, after exposure to inhaled budesonide, the number of infants born with orofacial clefts was similar to the expected number in the normal population (4 children vs. 3.3, respectively).</p><p>These same data were utilized in a second study bringing the total to 2534 infants whose mothers were exposed to inhaled budesonide. In this study, the rate of congenital malformations among infants whose mothers were exposed to inhaled budesonide during early pregnancy was not different from the rate for all newborn babies during the same period (3.6%).</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Budesonide and Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate</p><p>In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6-16, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate produced umbilical hernia in fetuses at doses less than the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at maternal inhaled doses of 12/0.66 mcg/kg/day and above). Fetal weights were reduced at approximately 5 and 3 times the MRHDID, respectively (on an AUC basis at a maternal inhaled dose of 80/4.4 mcg/kg (budesonide/formoterol)).

In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6-15, budesonide produced similar adverse fetal effects at doses approximately 8 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 500 mcg/kg/day). In another embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats, no teratogenic or embryocidal effects were seen at doses up to 4 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at maternal inhalation doses up to 250 mcg/kg/day).</p><p>In a peri-and post-natal development study, rats dosed from gestation day 15 to postpartum day 21, budesonide had no effects on delivery, but did have an effect on growth and development of offspring. Offspring survival was reduced and surviving offspring had decreased mean body weights at birth and during lactation at doses less than the MRHDID and higher (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at maternal subcutaneous doses of 20 mcg/kg/day and higher). These findings occurred in the presence of maternal toxicity.</p><p>Formoterol</p><p>In a fertility and reproduction study, male rats were orally dosed for 9 weeks and females for 2 weeks prior to pairing and throughout the mating period. Females were either dosed up to gestation day 19 or up until weaning of their offspring. Males were dosed up to 25 weeks. Umbilical hernia was observed in rat fetuses at oral doses 1600 times and greater than the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at maternal oral doses of 3000 mcg/kg/day and higher). Brachygnathia was observed in rat fetuses at a dose 8000 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 15,000 mcg/kg/day). Pregnancy was prolonged at a dose 8000 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal oral dose of 15,000 mcg/kg/day). Fetal and pup deaths occurred at doses approximately 1600 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at oral doses of 3000 mcg/kg/day and higher) during gestation.</p><p>In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6-15, no teratogenic, embryocidal or developmental effects were seen at doses up to 375 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with maternal inhalation doses up to 690 mcg/kg/day).</p><p>In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6-18, subcapsular cysts on the liver were observed in the fetuses at a dose 65,000 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal oral dose of 60,000 mcg/kg/day). No teratogenic effects were observed at doses up to 3800 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at maternal oral doses up to 3500 mcg/kg/day).</p><p>In a pre- and post-natal development study, pregnant female rats received formoterol at oral doses of 0, 210, 840, and 3400 mcg/kg/day from gestation day 6 through the lactation period. Pup survival was decreased from birth to postpartum day 26 at doses 110 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at maternal oral doses of 210 mcg/kg/day and higher), although there was no evidence of a dose- response relationship.

This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA-axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA-axis function. The long-term effect of this reduction in growth velocity associated with orally inhaled corticosteroids, including the impact on final height are unknown. The potential for “catch-up” growth following discontinuation of treatment with orally inhaled corticosteroids has not been adequately studied.</p><p>In a study of asthmatic children 5 to 12 years of age, those treated with budesonide DPI 200 mcg twice daily (n=311) had a 1.1 centimeter reduction in growth compared with those receiving placebo (n=418) at the end of one year; the difference between these two treatment groups did not increase further over three years of additional treatment. By the end of 4 years, children treated with budesonide DPI and children treated with placebo had similar growth velocities. Conclusions drawn from this study may be confounded by the unequal use of corticosteroids in the treatment groups and inclusion of data from patients attaining puberty during the course of the study.</p><p>The growth of pediatric patients receiving orally inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, should be monitored. If a child or adolescent on any corticosteroid appears to have growth suppression, the possibility that he/she is particularly sensitive to this effect should be considered. The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained. To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, each patient should be titrated to the lowest strength that effectively controls his/her asthma <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of asthma patients treated with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate twice daily in two 12-week studies and a 26-week postmarketing study, 791 were 65 years of age or older, of whom 141 were 75 years of age or older.</p><p>In the COPD studies of 6 to 12 months duration, 810 patients treated with budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5, two inhalations twice daily were 65 years old and above and of those, 177 patients were 75 years of age and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><p>As with other products containing beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists, special caution should be observed when using budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate in geriatric patients who have concomitant cardiovascular disease that could be adversely affected by beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists.</p><p>Based on available data for budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate or its active components, no adjustment of dosage of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate in geriatric patients is warranted.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Formal pharmacokinetic studies using budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate have not been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. However, since both budesonide and formoterol fumarate are predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of budesonide and formoterol fumarate in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Formal pharmacokinetic studies using budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate have not been conducted in patients with renal impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL</span></p><p>BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL contains both budesonide and formoterol; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL FUMARATE DIHYDRATE INHALATION AEROSOL. In pharmacokinetic studies, single doses of 960/54 mcg (12 actuations of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 80/4.5) and 1280/36 mcg (8 actuations of 160/4.5), were administered to patients with COPD. A total of 1920/54 mcg (12 actuations of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5) was administered as a single dose to both healthy subjects and patients with asthma. In a long-term active-controlled safety study in adolescent and adult asthma patients 12 years of age and older, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 160/4.5 was administered for up to 12 months at doses up to twice the highest recommended daily dose. There were no clinically significant adverse reactions observed in any of these studies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Budesonide</span></p><p>The potential for acute toxic effects following overdose of budesonide is low.

As with all sympathomimetic medications, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with abuse of formoterol. No clinically significant adverse reactions were seen when formoterol was delivered to adult patients with acute bronchoconstriction at a dose of 90 mcg/day over 3 hours or to stable asthmatics 3 times a day at a total dose of 54 mcg/day for 3 days.</p><p>Treatment of formoterol overdosage consists of discontinuation of the medication together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of formoterol.

These drugs represent two classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a long-acting selective beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenoceptor agonist) that have different effects on clinical, physiological, and inflammatory indices of COPD and asthma.</p><p><span class="Bold">Budesonide</span></p><p>Budesonide is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. In standard <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and animal models, budesonide has approximately a 200-fold higher affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and a 1000-fold higher topical anti-inflammatory potency than cortisol (rat croton oil ear edema assay). As a measure of systemic activity, budesonide is 40 times more potent than cortisol when administered subcutaneously and 25 times more potent when administered orally in the rat thymus involution assay.</p><p>In glucocorticoid receptor affinity studies, the 22R form of budesonide was two times as active as the 22S epimer. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicated that the two forms of budesonide do not interconvert.</p><p>Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of COPD and asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non–allergic-mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in COPD and asthma.</p><p>Studies in asthmatic patients have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects over a wide range of doses of budesonide. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, extensive first pass hepatic degradation of orally absorbed drug (85%-95%), and the low potency of formed metabolites.</p><p><span class="Bold">Formoterol</span></p><p>Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic agonist (beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist) with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that formoterol has more than 200-fold greater agonist activity at beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptors than at beta<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptors. The <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> binding selectivity to beta<span class="Sub">2</span>- over beta<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenoceptors is higher for formoterol than for albuterol (5 times), whereas salmeterol has a higher (3 times) beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-selectivity ratio than formoterol.</p><p>Although beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenergic receptors.

Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> tests show that formoterol is an inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes, from the human lung. Formoterol also inhibits histamine-induced plasma albumin extravasation in anesthetized guinea pigs and inhibits allergen-induced eosinophil influx in dogs with airway hyper-responsiveness.

For budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, small mean increases in serum glucose and decreases in serum potassium (+0.44 mmol/L and -0.18 mmol/L at the highest dose, respectively) were observed with increasing doses of formoterol, compared to budesonide. In ECGs, budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate produced small dose-related mean increases in heart rate (approximately 3 bpm at the highest dose), and QTc intervals (3-6 msec) compared to budesonide alone. No subject had a QT or QTc value ≥500 msec.</p><p>In the United States, five 12-week, active- and placebo-controlled studies and one 6-month active-controlled study evaluated 2976 patients aged 6 years and older with asthma.

Similar results were obtained in pediatric patients. In another study in adults, doses of 400, 800, and 1600 mcg of inhaled budesonide twice daily for 6 weeks were examined; 1600 mcg twice daily (twice the maximum recommended dose) resulted in a 27% reduction in stimulated cortisol (6-hour ACTH infusion) while 10-mg prednisone resulted in a 35% reduction. In this study, no patient on budesonide at doses of 400 and 800 mcg twice daily met the criterion for an abnormal stimulated-cortisol response (peak cortisol &lt;14.5 mcg/dL assessed by liquid chromatography) following ACTH infusion. An open-label, long-term follow-up of 1133 patients for up to 52 weeks confirmed the minimal effect on the HPA-axis (both basal- and stimulated-plasma cortisol) of budesonide when administered at recommended doses.

The systemic exposure of formoterol as evidenced by AUC, was about 30% and 16% higher from budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate pMDI compared to formoterol alone treatment arm and coadministration of individual components of budesonide and formoterol treatment arm, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Budesonide:</span> The volume of distribution of budesonide was approximately 3 L/kg. It was 85%-90% bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding was constant over the concentration range (1-100 nmol/L) achieved with, and exceeding, recommended inhaled doses. Budesonide showed little or no binding to corticosteroid binding globulin. Budesonide rapidly equilibrated with red blood cells in a concentration independent manner with a blood plasma ratio of about 0.8.</p><p><span class="Italics">Formoterol:</span> Over the concentration range of 10-500 nmol/L, plasma protein binding for the RR and SS enantiomers of formoterol was 46% and 58%, respectively.

<span class="Italics">Budesonide: In vitro</span> studies with human liver homogenates have shown that budesonide was rapidly and extensively metabolized. Two major metabolites formed via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) catalyzed biotransformation have been isolated and identified as 16α-hydroxyprednisolone and 6ß-hydroxybudesonide. The corticosteroid activity of each of these two metabolites was less than 1% of that of the parent compound. No qualitative differences between the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> metabolic patterns were detected. Negligible metabolic inactivation was observed in human lung and serum preparations.</p><p><span class="Italics">Formoterol:</span> The primary metabolism of formoterol is by direct glucuronidation and by O-demethylation followed by conjugation to inactive metabolites. Secondary metabolic pathways include deformylation and sulfate conjugation.

Peak budesonide concentrations of 1.4 nmol/L occurred at 20 minutes post-dose. This study also demonstrated that the total systemic exposure to budesonide from budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate was approximately 30% lower than from inhaled budesonide via a dry powder inhaler that was also evaluated at the same delivered dose.

No conclusions can be drawn on the effect of race due to the low number of non-Caucasians evaluated for PK.</p><p><span class="Italics">Nursing Mothers</span></p><p>The disposition of budesonide when delivered by inhalation from a dry powder inhaler at doses of 200 or 400 mcg twice daily for at least 3 months was studied in eight lactating women with asthma from 1 to 6 months postpartum. Systemic exposure to budesonide in these women appears to be comparable to that in non-lactating women with asthma from other studies. Breast milk obtained over eight hours post-dose revealed that the maximum concentration of budesonide for the 400 and 800 mcg total daily doses was 0.39 and 0.78 nmol/L, respectively, and occurred within 45 minutes after dosing. The estimated oral daily dose of budesonide from breast milk to the infant is approximately 0.007 and 0.014 mcg/kg/day for the two dose regimens used in this study, which represents approximately 0.3% to 1% of the dose inhaled by the mother. Budesonide levels in plasma samples obtained from five infants at about 90 minutes after breastfeeding (and about 140 minutes after drug administration to the mother) were below quantifiable levels (&lt;0.02 nmol/L in four infants and &lt;0.04 nmol/L in one infant) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal or Hepatic Insufficiency</span></p><p>There are no data regarding the specific use of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.
