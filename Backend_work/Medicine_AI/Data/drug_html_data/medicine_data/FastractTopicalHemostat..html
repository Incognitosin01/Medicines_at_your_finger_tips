</ul><p class="First">FasTRACT™ topical hemostat is an increased activity coagulative hemostatic gel containing 10% ferric sulfate, built around a novel organic polymer. This unique formulation is easy to use and rinses clean. FasTRACT hemostatic gel provides superior hemostasis at a much lower concentration of ferric sulfate. Because it rinses cleanly, FasTRACT minimizes post-operative black discoloration under restorations.</p><ul>

</ul><p class="First">Twist on scrub tip brush for easy application. Deliver hemostatic gel directly to bleeding areas. Use the fiber-flocked ball to burnish/rub gel into bleeding capillaries. Continue to burnish until bleeding stops. When control of bleeding is achieved, use suction and heavy air/water spray to remove coagulum and residual gel from surface. If bleeding restarts, repeat application and burnishing.</p><p class="First">Patents Pending. Caution: Federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a licensed professional.
