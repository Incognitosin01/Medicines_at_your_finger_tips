Fiasp is a fast-acting insulin that starts to work about 15 minutes after injection, peaks in about 1 hour, and keeps working for 2 to 4 hours.</p><p>Fiasp is used to improve blood sugar control in adults and children with diabetes mellitus.  Fiasp is sometimes used together with a long-acting or intermediate-acting insulin.</p><p>Fiasp may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Never share an injection pen, cartridge, or syringe with another person, even if the needle has been changed.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Fiasp if you are allergic to it, or if you are having an episode of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).</p><p>Fiasp is not approved for use by anyone younger than 2 years old, and should not be used to treat type 2 diabetes in a child of any age. <b>Fiasp</b> is for use only in adults.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
