It is also used to treat malaria.</p><p>Do not confuse this medicine with quinine, which, although related, has different medical uses.</p><p>Quinidine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Quinidex Extentabs</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Quinidine has not been widely studied in children; however, it is used in children to treat abnormal heart rhythms and to treat malaria. Children may be able to take higher doses than adults and may have fewer side effects (such as vomiting, loss of appetite, and diarrhea) than adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of quinidine in the elderly with use in other age groups, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults. However, quinidine may remain in the bodies of older adults longer than it does in younger adults, which may increase the risk of side effects and which may require lower doses.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
