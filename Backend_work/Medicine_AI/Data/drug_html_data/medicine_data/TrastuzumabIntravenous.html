It can be used alone or with other cancer medicines (eg, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, doxorubicin, paclitaxel).</p><p>Trastuzumab injection is also used in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil to treat HER2-overexpressing metastatic (cancer that has spread) stomach and gastroesophageal (stomach and esophagus) cancer.</p><p>Trastuzumab prevents the growth of some tumors that produce extra amounts of a certain substance known as the HER2 protein. <i>It should only be used in patients whose tumors have been shown to produce extra amounts of this protein (HER2 overexpression)</i>.</p><p>Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by trastuzumab, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, such as a skin rash, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects do not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.</p><p>Trastuzumab is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using trastuzumab</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For trastuzumab, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to trastuzumab or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of trastuzumab injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of trastuzumab injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related heart problems, which may require caution in patients receiving trastuzumab.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using trastuzumab with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of trastuzumab.
