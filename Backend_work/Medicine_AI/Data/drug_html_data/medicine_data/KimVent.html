Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse is a near-neutral solution (pH range 5-7). Chlorhexidine gluconate is a salt of chlorhexidine and gluconic acid. Its structural formula is: C<span class="Sub">22</span>H<span class="Sub">30</span>Cl<span class="Sub">2</span>N<span class="Sub">10</span>•2C<span class="Sub">6</span>H<span class="Sub">12</span>O<span class="Sub">7</span> MW = 897.8</p><h2>KimVent - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12% provides antimicrobial activity during oral rinsing. The clinical significance of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse's anti-microbial activities is not clear. Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general reduction of counts of certain assayed bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, ranging from 54-97% through six months use. Use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse in a six month clinical study did not result in any significant changes in bacterial resistance, overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem. Three months after chlorhexidine gluconate use was discontinued, the number of bacteria in plaque had returned to baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine gluconate was equal to that at baseline.</p><h3>PHARMACOKINETICS</h3><p class="First">Pharmacokinetic studies with a 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse indicate approximately 30% of the active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is retained in the oral cavity following rinsing. This retained drug is slowly released into the oral fluids. Studies conducted on human subjects and animals demonstrate chlorhexidine gluconate is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The mean plasma level of chlorhexidine gluconate reached a peak of 0.206 µg/g in humans 30 minutes after they ingested a 300-mg dose of the drug. Detectable levels of chlorhexidine gluconate were not present in the plasma of these subjects 12 hours after the compound was administered. Excretion of chlorhexidine gluconate occurred primarily through the feces (~90%). Less than 1% of the chlorhexidine gluconate ingested by these subjects was excreted in the urine.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for KimVent</h2><p class="First">16 oz. Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12% - Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12% is indicated for use between dental visits as part of a professional program for the treatment of gingivitis as characterized by redness and swelling of the gingivae, including gingival bleeding upon probing. Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12% has not been tested among patients with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG). For patients having coexisting gingivitis and periodontitis, see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12% should not be used by persons who are known to be hypersensitive to chlorhexidine gluconate or other formula ingredients.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">The effect of Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12% on periodontitis has not been determined. An increase in supragingival calculus was noted in clinical testing in users of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse compared with control users. It is not known if chlorhexicine gluconate use results in an increase in subgingival calculus. Calculus deposits should be removed by a dental prophylaxis at intervals not greater than six months. Hypersensitivity and generalized allergic reactions have occurred. See <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at chlorhexidine gluconate doses up to 300 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively, and have not revealed evidence of harm to fetus. However, adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have not been done. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12% is administered to nursing women.</p><p>In parturition and lactation studies with rats, no evidence of impaired parturition or of toxic effects to suckling pups was observed when chlorhexidine gluconate was administered to dams at doses that were over 100 times greater than that which would result from a person's ingesting 30 ml (2 capfuls) of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse, 0.12% per day.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical effectiveness and safety of Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12% have not been established in children under the age of 18</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">In a drinking water study in rats, carcinogenic effects were not observed at doses up to 38 mg/kg/day. Mutagenic effects were not observed in two mammalian <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mutagenesis studies with chlorhexidine gluconate. The highest doses of chlorhexidine used in a mouse dominant-lethal assay and a hamster cytogenetics test were 1000 mg/kg/day and 250 mg/kg/day, respectively. No evidence of impaired fertility was observed in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most common side effects associated with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinses are: 1) an increase in staining of teeth and other oral surfaces; 2) an increase in calculus formation; and 3) an alteration in taste perception, see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>. Oral irritation and local allergy-type symptoms have been spontaneously reported as side effects associated with use of chlorhexidine gluconate rinse.</p><p>The following oral mucosal side effects were reported during placebo-controlled adult clinical trials: aphthous ulcer, grossly obvious gingivitis, trauma, ulceration, erythema, desquamation, coated tongue, keratinization, geographic tongue, mucocele, and short frenum. Each occurred at a frequency of less than 1.0%. Among post marketing reports, the most frequently reported oral mucosal symptoms associated with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse, 0.12% are stomatitis, gingivitis, glossitis, ulcer, dry mouth, hypesthesia, glossal edema, and paresthesia.</p><p>Minor irritation and superficial desquamation of the oral mucosa have been noted in patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse, 0.12%.</p><p>There have been cases of parotid gland swelling and inflammation of the salivary glands (sialadentis) reported in patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse.</p><p>To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co., Inc. at 1-800-262-9010 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Ingestion of 1 or 2 ounces of Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12% by a small child (~10 kg body weight) might result in gastric distress, including nausea, or signs of alcohol intoxication. Medical attention should be sought if more than 4 ounces of Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12% is ingested by a small child or if signs of alcohol intoxication develop.</p><h2>KimVent Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12% therapy should be initiated directly following a dental prophylaxis. Patients using Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12% should be reevaluated and given a thorough prophylaxis at intervals no longer than six months.</p><p>Recommended use is twice daily oral rinsing for 30 seconds, morning and evening after toothbrushing. Usual dosage is 1/2 fl oz (marked in cup) of undiluted Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12%.
