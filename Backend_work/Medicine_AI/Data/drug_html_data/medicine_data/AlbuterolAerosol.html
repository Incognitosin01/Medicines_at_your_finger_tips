</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Albuterol Aerosol</h2><h3>Bronchospasm</h3><p class="First">Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol is indicated for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in patients 4 years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease.</p><h3>Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm</h3><p class="First">Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol is indicated for the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm in patients 4 years of age and older.</p><h2>Albuterol Aerosol Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Bronchospasm</h3><p class="First">For treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm or prevention of symptoms associated with bronchospasm, the usual dosage for adults and children 4 years and older is two inhalations repeated every 4 to 6 hours. More frequent administration or a larger number of inhalations is not recommended. In some patients, one inhalation every 4 hours may be sufficient.</p><h3>Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm</h3><p class="First">The usual dosage for adults and children 4 years of age or older is two inhalations 15 to 30 minutes before exercise.</p><h3>Administration Information</h3><p class="First">Administer albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol by oral inhalation only. Shake well before each spray. To maintain proper use of this product and to prevent medication build-up and blockage, it is important to follow the cleaning directions carefully.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Priming</span></span></p><p>Prime the inhaler before using for the first time and in cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 2 weeks by releasing three sprays into the air, away from the face.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cleaning</span></span></p><p>As with all HFA-containing albuterol inhalers, to maintain proper use of this product and to prevent medication build-up and blockage, it is important to clean the plastic mouthpiece regularly. The inhaler may cease to deliver medication if the plastic actuator mouthpiece is not properly cleaned and dried. To clean: Wash the plastic mouthpiece with warm running water for 30 seconds, shake off excess water, and air dry thoroughly at least once a week<span class="Bold">. If the patient has more than one albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol inhaler, the patient should wash each one separately to prevent attaching the wrong canister to the wrong plastic actuator. In this way, the patient can be sure to always know the correct number of remaining doses. Never attach a canister of medication from any other inhaler to the albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol actuator and never attach the albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol canister to an actuator from any other inhaler.</span> If the mouthpiece becomes blocked, washing the mouthpiece will remove the blockage. If it is necessary to use the inhaler before it is completely dry, shake off excess water, replace canister, spray twice into the air away from face, and take the prescribed dose. After such use, the mouthpiece should be rewashed and allowed to air dry thoroughly <span class="Italics">[see FDA-APPROVED PATIENT LABELING (17.9)]</span>.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Dose Indicator</span></span></span></p><p>Albuterol sulfate inhaler comes with a dose indicator appearing as small window above the plastic mouthpiece. A new inhaler first shows "200" in the dose indicator window. The dose indicator will show the approximate number of actuations (sprays) of medicine remaining in the inhaler. As you use the inhaler, the dose indicator will typically rotate during every 5 to 7 actuations (sprays) towards the next decreasing number. When the dose indicator displays "40," where the background changes from green to red to remind the patient to contact their pharmacist for a refill of medication or consult their physician for a prescription refill. The background color will be all red when the indicator approaches 20. The indicator will stop moving at "0". Albuterol sulfate inhaler should be discarded when the dose indicator displays "0" or after the expiration date on the product, whichever comes first.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol is an inhalation aerosol. Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol is supplied as an 8.5 g/200 actuations pressurized aluminum canister with a blue plastic actuator with a dose indicator and green dust cap each in boxes of one. Each actuation delivers 120 mcg of albuterol sulfate from the canister valve and 108 mcg of albuterol sulfate from the actuator mouthpiece (equivalent to 90 mcg of albuterol base).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to albuterol and any other albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol components. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema, and rash have been reported after the use of albuterol sulfate <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Paradoxical Bronchospasm</h3><p class="First">Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol can produce paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm, when associated with inhaled formulations, frequently occurs with the first use of a new canister.</p><h3>Deterioration of Asthma</h3><p class="First">Asthma may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If the patient needs more doses of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol than usual, this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires re-evaluation of the patient and treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for anti-inflammatory treatment, e.g., corticosteroids.</p><h3>Use of Anti-inflammatory Agents</h3><p class="First">The use of beta-adrenergic-agonist bronchodilators alone may not be adequate to control asthma in many patients. Early consideration should be given to adding anti-inflammatory agents, e.g., corticosteroids, to the therapeutic regimen.</p><h3>Cardiovascular Effects</h3><p class="First">Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, like other beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce ECG changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, like all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.</p><h3>Do Not Exceed Recommended Dose</h3><p class="First">Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs in patients with asthma. The exact cause of death is unknown, but cardiac arrest following an unexpected development of a severe acute asthmatic crisis and subsequent hypoxia is suspected.</p><h3>Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of albuterol sulfate, as demonstrated by rare cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema. The potential for hypersensitivity must be considered in the clinical evaluation of patients who experience immediate hypersensitivity reactions while receiving albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol.</p><h3>Coexisting Conditions</h3><p class="First">Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, like all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension; in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus; and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Clinically significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been seen in individual patients and could be expected to occur in some patients after use of any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator. Large doses of intravenous albuterol have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.</p><h3>Hypokalemia</h3><p class="First">As with other beta-agonists, albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease is usually transient, not requiring supplementation.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Use of albuterol sulfate may be associated with the following:</p><p>   •   Paradoxical bronchospasm <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]</span></p><p>   •   Cardiovascular Effects <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)]</span></p><p>   •   Immediate hypersensitivity reactions <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)]</span></p><p>   •   Hypokalemia <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)]</span></p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">A total of 1090 subjects were treated with albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, or with the same formulation of albuterol as in albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, during the worldwide clinical development program.</p><p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adult and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older</span></span></p><p>The adverse reaction information presented in the table below concerning albuterol sulfate is derived from a 6-week, blinded study which compared albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol (180 mcg four times daily) with a double-blinded matched placebo HFA-Inhalation Aerosol and an evaluator-blinded marketed active comparator HFA-134a albuterol inhaler in 172 asthmatic patients 12 to 76 years of age. The table lists the incidence of all adverse events (whether considered by the investigator drug related or unrelated to drug) from this study which occurred at a rate of 3% or greater in the albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol treatment group and more frequently in the albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol treatment group than in the matched placebo group. Overall, the incidence and nature of the adverse events reported for albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol and the marketed active comparator HFA-134a albuterol inhaler were comparable.</p><p>Adverse events reported by less than 3% of the patients receiving albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol but by a greater proportion of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol patients than the matched placebo patients, which have the potential to be related to albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, included chest pain, infection, diarrhea, glossitis, accidental injury (nervous system), anxiety, dyspnea, ear disorder, ear pain, and urinary tract infection.</p><p>In small cumulative dose studies, tremor, nervousness, and headache were the most frequently occurring adverse events.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients 4 to 11 Years of Age</span></span></p><p>Adverse events reported in a 3-week pediatric clinical trial comparing the same formulation of albuterol as in albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol (180 mcg albuterol four times daily) to a matching placebo HFA inhalation aerosol occurred at a low incidence rate (no greater than 2% in the active treatment group) and were similar to those seen in adult and adolescent trials.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Reports have included rare cases of aggravated bronchospasm, lack of efficacy, asthma exacerbation (reported fatal in one case), muscle cramps, and various oropharyngeal side-effects such as throat irritation, altered taste, glossitis, tongue ulceration, and gagging.</p><p>The following adverse events have been observed in postapproval use of inhaled albuterol: urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hoarseness, oropharyngeal edema, and arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, extrasystoles). In addition, albuterol, like other sympathomimetic agents, can cause adverse reactions such as: angina, hypertension or hypotension, palpitations, central nervous system stimulation, insomnia, headache, nervousness, tremor, muscle cramps, drying or irritation of the oropharynx, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Other short-acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators should not be used concomitantly with albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects.</p><h3>Beta-Blockers</h3><p class="First">Beta-adrenergic-receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic-blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, consider cardioselective beta-blockers, although they should be administered with caution.</p><h3>Diuretics</h3><p class="First">The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia which may result from the administration of non- potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded.</p><p>Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with non-potassium sparing diuretics. Consider monitoring potassium levels.</p><h3>Digoxin</h3><p class="First">Mean decreases of 16% and 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single dose intravenous and oral administration of albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. The clinical significance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving albuterol and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin and albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol.</p><h3>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants</h3><p class="First">Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of albuterol on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated. Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Exposure Registry</p><p>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to asthma medications during pregnancy. For more information, contact the Mothers To Baby Pregnancy Studies conducted by the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists at 1-877-311-8972 or visit http://mothertobaby.org/pregnancystudies/.</p><p>Risk Summary</p><p>There are no randomized clinical studies of use of albuterol during pregnancy. Available data from published epidemiological studies and postmarketing case reports of pregnancy outcomes following inhaled albuterol use do not consistently demonstrate a risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. There are clinical considerations with use of albuterol in pregnant women <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS]</span>. In animal reproduction studies, when albuterol sulfate was administered subcutaneously to pregnant mice there was evidence of cleft palate at less than and up to 9 times the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID) <span class="Italics">[see DATA]</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p>Clinical Considerations</p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</span></p><p>In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma, there is an increased risk of preeclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age in the neonate. Pregnant women should be closely monitored and medication adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal control.</p><p><span class="Italics">Labor or Delivery</span></p><p>Because of the potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine contractility, use of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol for relief of bronchospasm during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk. Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol has not been approved for the management of pre-term labor. Serious adverse reactions, including pulmonary edema, have been reported during or following treatment of premature labor with beta2-agonists, including albuterol.</p><p>Data</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In a mouse reproduction study, subcutaneously administered albuterol sulfate produced cleft palate formation in 5 of 111 (4.5%) fetuses at an exposure nine-tenths of the MRHDID for adults (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>basis at a maternal dose of 0.25 mg/kg) and in 10 of 108 (9.3%) fetuses at approximately 9 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>basis at a maternal dose of 2.5 mg/kg). Similar effects were not observed at approximately one-eleventh the MRHDID for adults (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>basis at a maternal dose of 0.025 mg/kg). Cleft palate also occurred in 22 of 72 (30.5%) fetuses from females treated subcutaneously with isoproterenol (positive control).</p><p>In a rabbit reproduction study, orally administered albuterol sulfate induced cranioschisis in 7 of 19 fetuses (37%) at approximately 750 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>basis at a maternal dose of 50 mg/kg).</p><p>In a rat reproduction study, an albuterol sulfate/HFA-134a formulation administered by inhalation did not produce any teratogenic effects at exposures approximately 80 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>basis at a maternal dose of 10.5 mg/kg).</p><p>A study in which pregnant rats were dosed with radiolabeled albuterol sulfate demonstrated that drug-related material is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">Risk Summary</p><p>There are no available data on the presence of albuterol in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. However, plasma levels of albuterol after inhaled therapeutic doses are low in humans, and if present in breast milk, albuterol has a low oral bioavailability <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for albuterol and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from albuterol or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol are for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in children 12 years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease is based on one 6-week clinical trial in 116 patients 12 years of age and older with asthma comparing doses of 180 mcg four times daily with placebo, and one single-dose crossover study comparing doses of 90, 180, and 270 mcg with placebo in 58 patients <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1)]</span>. The safety and effectiveness of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol for treatment of exercise-induced bronchospasm in children 12 years of age and older is based on one single-dose crossover study in 24 adults and adolescents with exercise-induced bronchospasm comparing doses of 180 mcg with placebo <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2)].</span></p><p>The safety of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol are in children 4 to 11 years of age is based on one 3-week clinical trial in 50 patients 4 to 11 years of age with asthma using the same formulation of albuterol as in albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol are comparing doses of 180 mcg four times daily with placebo. The effectiveness of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol are in children 4 to 11 years of age is extrapolated from clinical trials in patients 12 years of age and older with asthma and exercise-induced bronchospasm, based on data from a single-dose study comparing the bronchodilatory effect of albuterol sulfate 90 mcg and 180 mcg with placebo in 55 patients with asthma and a 3-week clinical trial using the same formulation of albuterol as in albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol are in 95 asthmatic children 4 to 11 years of age comparing a dose of 180 mcg albuterol four times daily with placebo <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1)].</span></p><p>The safety and effectiveness of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol are in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4, 5.7)]</span>.</p><p>All beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic agonists, including albuterol, are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The expected symptoms with overdosage are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the symptoms listed under ADVERSE REACTIONS, e.g., seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats per minute, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia.</p><p>Hypokalemia may also occur. As with all sympathomimetic medications, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with abuse of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol.</p><p>Treatment consists of discontinuation of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol together with appropriate symptomatic therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol.</p><p>The oral median lethal dose of albuterol sulfate in mice is greater than 2,000 mg/kg (approximately 6,800 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis and approximately 3,200 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In mature rats, the subcutaneous median lethal dose of albuterol sulfate is approximately 450 mg/kg (approximately 3,000 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis and approximately 1,400 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In young rats, the subcutaneous median lethal dose is approximately 2,000 mg/kg (approximately 14,000 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis and approximately 6,400 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>basis). The inhalation median lethal dose has not been determined in animals.</p><h2>Albuterol Aerosol Description</h2><p class="First">The active ingredient of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol is albuterol sulfate, a racemic salt, of albuterol. Albuterol sulfate has the chemical name α<span class="Sup">1</span>-[(<span class="Italics">tert</span>-butylamino) methyl]-4-hydroxy-<span class="Italics">m</span>-xylene-α,α'-diol sulfate (2:1) (salt), and has the following chemical structure:</p><p>The molecular weight of albuterol sulfate is 576.7, and the empirical formula is (C<span class="Sub">13</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span>)<span class="Sub">2</span><span class="Bold">•</span>H<span class="Sub">2</span>SO<span class="Sub">4</span>. Albuterol sulfate is a white or almost white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water and very slightly soluble in ethanol. Albuterol sulfate is the official generic name in the United States, and salbutamol sulfate is the World Health Organization recommended generic name. Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol is a pressurized metered-dose aerosol unit with a dose indicator. Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol is for oral inhalation only. It contains a microcrystalline suspension of albuterol sulfate in propellant HFA-134a (1, 1, 1, 2-tetrafluoroethane) and ethanol.</p><p>Prime the inhaler before using for the first time and in cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 2 weeks by releasing three sprays into the air, away from the face. After priming, each actuation delivers 108 mcg albuterol sulfate, from the actuator mouthpiece (equivalent to 90 mcg of albuterol base). Each canister provides 200 actuations (inhalations).</p><p>This product does not contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as the propellant.</p><h2>Albuterol Aerosol - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Albuterol sulfate is a beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic agonist. The pharmacologic effects of albuterol sulfate are attributable to activation of beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle. Activation of beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptors leads to the activation of adenylcyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). This increase of cyclic AMP is associated with the activation of protein kinase A, which in turn inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in muscle relaxation. Albuterol relaxes the smooth muscle of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles. Albuterol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway. While it is recognized that beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there are beta-receptors in the human heart, 10% to 50% of which are cardiac beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)]</span>.</p><p>Albuterol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects. However, inhaled albuterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The systemic levels of albuterol are low after inhalation of recommended doses. In a crossover study conducted in healthy male and female volunteers, high cumulative doses of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol (1,080 mcg of albuterol base administered over one hour) yielded mean peak plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and systemic exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span>) of approximately 4,100 pg/mL and 28,426 pg/mL*hr, respectively compared to approximately 3,900 pg/mL and 28,395 pg/mL*hr, respectively following the same dose of an active HFA-134a albuterol inhaler comparator. The terminal plasma half-life of albuterol delivered by albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol was approximately 6 hours. Comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters demonstrated no differences between the products.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic profile of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol was evaluated in a two-way cross-over study in 11 healthy pediatric volunteers, 4 to 11 years of age. A single dose administration of albuterol sulfate (180 mcg albuterol base) yielded a least square mean (SE) C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0 to ∞</span> of 1,100 (1.18) pg/mL and 5,120 (1.15) pg/mL*hr, respectively. The least square mean (SE) terminal plasma half-life of albuterol delivered by albuterol sulfate was 166 (7.8) minutes.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Elimination</span></span></p><p>Information available in the published literature suggests that the primary enzyme responsible for the metabolism of albuterol in humans is SULTIA3 (sulfotransferase). When racemic albuterol was administered either intravenously or via inhalation after oral charcoal administration, there was a 3- to 4-fold difference in the area under the concentration-time curves between the (R)- and (S)-albuterol enantiomers, with (S)-albuterol concentrations being consistently higher. However, without charcoal pretreatment, after either oral or inhalation administration the differences were 8- to 24-fold, suggesting that the (R)- albuterol is preferentially metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract, presumably by SULTIA3.</p><p>The primary route of elimination of albuterol is through renal excretion (80% to 100%) of either the parent compound or the primary metabolite. Less than 20% of the drug is detected in the feces.

In another study this effect was blocked by the coadministration of propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist. In an 18-month study in CD-1 mice, albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses of up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 1,900 times and 740 times the MRHDID for adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>basis). In a 22-month study in Golden Hamsters, albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses of up to 50 mg/kg (approximately 250 times and 100 times the MRHDID for adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>basis).</p><p>Albuterol sulfate was not mutagenic in the Ames test or a mutation test in yeast.

Each canister contains 8.5 g of the formulation and provides 200 actuations (NDC 68180-963-01). Each actuation delivers 120 mcg of albuterol sulfate from the canister valve and 108 mcg of albuterol sulfate from the actuator mouthpiece (equivalent to 90 mcg of albuterol base).</p><p>SHAKE WELL BEFORE USE. Store between 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F). [See USP Controlled Room Temperature.] Contents under pressure. Do not puncture or incinerate. Protect from freezing temperatures and prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. Exposure to temperatures above 120<span class="Sup">o</span>F may cause bursting. For best results, canister should be at room temperature before use. Avoid spraying in eyes. Keep out of reach of children.</p><p>See FDA-Approved Patient Labeling (17.9) for priming and cleaning instructions.</p><p>The blue actuator supplied with albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol should not be used with the canister from any other inhalation aerosol products. The albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol canister should not be used with the actuator from any other inhalation aerosol products.</p><p>Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol has a dose indicator attached to the actuator. Patients should never try to alter the numbers for the dose indicator or tamper with the dose indicator button mechanism. Discard the albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol when the indicator displays 0 or after the expiration date on the product, whichever comes first. The labeled amount of medication in each actuation cannot be assured after the indicator displays 0, even though the canister is not completely empty and will continue to operate. Never immerse the canister into water to determine how full the canister is ("float test").</p><p>Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol does not contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as the propellant.</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">See FDA-Approved Patient Labeling (17.9)</p><p>Patients should be given the following information:</p><h3>Frequency of Use</h3><p class="First">The action of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol should last for 4 to 6 hours. Do not use albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol more frequently than recommended. Instruct patients to not increase the dose or frequency of doses of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol without consulting the physician. If patients find that treatment with albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol becomes less effective for symptomatic relief, symptoms become worse, and/or they need to use the product more frequently than usual, they should seek medical attention immediately.</p><h3>Priming and Cleaning</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Priming</span></span></p><p>Priming is essential to ensure appropriate albuterol content in each actuation.</p><p>Instruct patients to prime the inhaler before using for the first time and in cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 2 weeks by releasing three sprays into the air, away from the face.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cleaning</span></span></p><p>To ensure proper dosing and prevent actuator orifice blockage, instruct patients to wash the blue plastic actuator mouthpiece and dry thoroughly at least once a week. Instruct patients that if they have more than one albuterol sulfate inhaler, they should wash each one at separate times to prevent attaching the wrong canister to the wrong plastic actuator. In this way, they can be sure they will always know the correct number of remaining doses. Patients should be instructed to never attach a canister of medicine from any other inhaler to the albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol actuator and never attach the albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol canister to an actuator from any other inhaler. Patients should not remove the canister from the actuator except during cleaning because reattachment may release a dose into the air and the dose indicator will typically rotate during every 5 to 7 actuations (sprays) towards the next decreasing number  Detailed cleaning instructions are included in the illustrated Information for the Patient leaflet.</p><h3>Dose Indicator</h3><p class="First">Patients should be informed that albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol has a dose indicator attached to the actuator. When the patient receives the inhaler, new inhaler first shows "200" in the dose indicator window. The dose indicator will show the approximate number of actuations (sprays) of medicine remaining in the inhaler. As you use the inhaler, the dose indicator will typically rotate during every 5 to 7 actuations (sprays) towards the next decreasing number. The dose-indicator window displays the number of sprays left in the inhaler in units of twenty (e.g., 200, 180, 160, etc). When the dose indicator displays "40," where the background changes from green to red to remind the patient to contact their pharmacist for a refill of medication or consult their physician for a prescription refill. The background color will be all red when the indicator approaches 20. The indicator will stop moving at "0". Discard the inhaler once the dose indicator displays "0". Patients should be informed to discard albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol inhaler when the dose indicator displays 0 or after the expiration date on the product, whichever comes first.</p><h3>Paradoxical Bronchospasm</h3><p class="First">Inform patients that albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol can produce paradoxical bronchospasm. Instruct patients to discontinue albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs.</p><h3>Concomitant Drug Use</h3><p class="First">While patients are taking albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, other inhaled drugs and asthma medications should be taken only as directed by a physician.</p><h3>Common Adverse Events</h3><p class="First">Common adverse effects of treatment with inhaled albuterol include palpitations, chest pain, rapid heart rate, tremor, or nervousness.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Patients who are pregnant or nursing should contact their physician about the use of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol.</p><p>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to asthma medications during pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>General Information on Use</h3><p class="First">Effective and safe use of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol includes an understanding of the way that it should be administered.</p><p>Shake well before each spray.</p><p>Use albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol only with the actuator supplied with the product. Discard the albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol inhaler when the dose indicator displays 0 or after the expiration date on the product, whichever comes first.
