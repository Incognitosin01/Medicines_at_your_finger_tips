Benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial agent with demonstrated activity against <span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes</span>. This action, combined with the mild keratolytic effect of benzoyl peroxide, is believed to be responsible for its usefulness in acne. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is metabolized to benzoic acid and excreted as benzoate in the urine.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Neobenz Micro SD</h2><p class="First">NeoBenz<span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Italics">Micro</span> SD and NeoBenz<span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Italics">Micro</span> Wash are indicated for use in the topical treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">NeoBenz<span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Italics">Micro</span> SD and NeoBenz<span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Italics">Micro</span> Wash should not be used in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to benzoyl peroxide or to any of the other ingredients in the products.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">When using this product, avoid unnecessary sun exposure and use a sunscreen. Keep out of reach of children.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">For external use only. Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. If severe irritation develops, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, lips and mucous membranes. If accidental contact occurs, rinse with water. Avoid contact with hair, fabrics or carpeting as benzoyl peroxide will cause bleaching or discoloration. If excessive irritation develops, discontinue use and consult your physician.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Based upon all available evidence, benzoyl peroxide is not considered to be a carcinogen. However, data from a study using mice known to be highly susceptible to cancer suggest that benzoyl peroxide acts as a tumor promoter. The clinical significance of this finding is not known.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Category C - Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with benzoyl peroxide. It is also not known whether benzoyl peroxide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Benzoyl peroxide should be used by a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when benzoyl peroxide is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Allergic contact dermatitis and dryness have been reported with topical benzoyl peroxide therapy.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">If excessive scaling, erythema or edema occurs, the use of these preparations should be discontinued. To hasten resolution of the adverse effects, cool compresses may be used. After symptoms and signs subside, a reduced dosage schedule may be cautiously tried if the reaction is judged to be due to excessive use and not allergenicity.</p><h2>Neobenz Micro SD Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">NeoBenz<span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Italics">Micro</span> SD and NeoBenz<span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Italics">Micro</span> Wash should be used once or twice daily on the affected areas.
