</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Each vial of ANASCORP contains a sterile, lyophilized preparation containing not more than 19 milligrams total protein and not less than 150 LD<span class="Sub">50</span> (mouse) neutralizing units.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur with ANASCORP. Close patient monitoring for hypersensitivity reactions and readiness with intravenous therapy using epinephrine, corticosteroids, and diphenhydramine hydrochloride is recommended during the infusion of ANASCORP. If an anaphylactic reaction occurs during the infusion, terminate administration at once and administer appropriate emergency medical care.<br/>
<br/>
Patients with known allergies to horse protein are particularly at risk for an anaphylactic reaction. Patients who have had previous therapy with ANASCORP or another equine antivenom/antitoxin may have become sensitized to equine protein and be at risk for a severe hypersensitivity reaction.</p><h3>Delayed Allergic Reactions (Serum Sickness)</h3><p class="First">Monitor patients with follow-up visit(s) for signs and symptoms of delayed allergic reactions or serum sickness (e.g., rash, fever, myalgia, arthralgia), and treat appropriately if necessary. Eight out of 1,534 (0.5%) patients in the clinical trials exhibited symptoms suggestive of serum sickness. (6.1)</p><h3>Transmissible Infectious Agents</h3><p class="First">ANASCORP is made from equine (horse) plasma, it may therefore carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses.</p><h3>Reaction to Cresol</h3><p class="First">Trace amounts of cresol from the manufacturing process are contained in ANASCORP. Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of cresol as an injectable excipient.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most common adverse reactions observed in ≥ 2% of patients in the clinical studies for ANASCORP were: vomiting, pyrexia, rash, nausea and pruritus.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.<br/>
<br/>
A total of 1534 patients were treated with ANASCORP, ranging from less than one month to 90 years old. The patient population was comprised of 802 males and 732 females. Patients were monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions, including acute hypersensitivity reactions and serum sickness. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted at 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days after treatment to assess symptoms suggestive of ongoing venom effect, serum sickness, and any other adverse reactions.<br/>
<br/>
Table 1 shows the adverse reactions occurring in patients across all clinical trials for ANASCORP. Twenty-seven percent (421/1534) of patients receiving ANASCORP reported at least one adverse reaction.</p><p>No patients died or discontinued study participation for severe adverse reactions.<br/>
<br/>
Eight patients were considered to have serum sickness (Type III hypersensitivity); no patient manifested the full serum sickness syndrome. Three patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids and five others received either no treatment or symptomatic therapy.<br/>
<br/>
34 patients experienced a total of 39 severe adverse reactions such as respiratory distress, aspiration, hypoxia, ataxia, pneumonia, and eye swelling. It is not clear whether these adverse reactions were related to ANASCORP envenomation or a combination of both<span class="Sup">2</span>.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of ANASCORP . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.<br/>
<br/>
Chest tightness, palpitations, rash and pruritus.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">No drug interaction studies have been conducted with ANASCORP.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with ANASCORP. It is also not known whether ANASCORP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. ANASCORP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
It is not known whether ANASCORP is excreted in human breast milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when ANASCORP is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Seventy-eight percent of the patients enrolled in the clinical studies were pediatrics subjects(1204/1534), with ages ranging from less than one month to 18.7 years of age. Patient age groups were as follows: &lt; 2 years of age, 29%, 2 to 5 years, 37%, 5 to 18 years, 34%. The efficacy and safety of ANASCORP is comparable in pediatric and adult patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Specific studies in elderly patients have not been conducted, ANASCORP was administered to 77 patients over the age of 65 years with comparable efficacy and safety to the overall patient population.</p><h2>Anascorp Injection Description</h2><p class="First">ANASCORP [Centruroides (Scorpion) Immune F(ab')<span class="Sub">2</span> (Equine) Injection] is a sterile nonpyrogenic, lyophilized, polyvalent preparation of equine immune globulin F(ab')<span class="Sub">2</span> fragments, manufactured from plasma of horses immunized with with venom of <span class="Italics">C. noxius</span>, <span class="Italics">C.l. limpidus</span>, <span class="Italics">C.l. tecomanus</span>, and <span class="Italics">C.s.suffusus</span>. The product is obtained by pepsin digestion of horse plasma to remove the F<span class="Sub">c</span> portion of immune globulin, followed by fractionation and purification steps. The F(ab')<span class="Sub">2</span> content is not less than 85%, F(ab) content is not more than 7%, and the product contains less than 5% intact immunoglobulin. Each vial of ANASCORP contains 45-80 milligrams of sodium chloride, 4.3 - 38.3 milligrams of sucrose, and 6.6-94.9 milligrams of glycine as stabilizers. Trace amounts of pepsin, cresol (&lt; 0.058 mg/vial), borates (&lt; 1 mg/vial) and Sulfates (&lt; 1.7 mg/vial) may be present from the manufacturing process. Each vial contains no more than 19 milligrams of protein and will neutralize at least 150 LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of Centruroides scorpion venom in a mouse neutralization assay.<br/>
<br/>
The manufacturing procedures that contribute to the reduction of risk of viral transmission include pepsin digestion, ammonium sulfate precipitation/heat treatment and nanofiltration.</p><h2>Anascorp Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">ANASCORP is composed of venom-specific F(ab')<span class="Sub">2</span> fragments of immunoglobulin G (IgG) that bind and neutralize venom toxins, facilitating redistribution away from target tissues and elimination from the body.<span class="Sup">1</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Eight clinically healthy volunteers (6 males and 2 females, age: 17 to 26 years) received a bolus intravenous dose of 47.5 mg of Centruroides (Scorpion) Immune F(ab’)<span class="Sub">2</span>, (Equine) Injection. Blood samples were collected till 504 hours (21 days) and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by non-compartmental analysis which are summarized in Table 2<span class="Sup">3</span>.</p><p class="First">Mean ± sd</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of ANASCORP was assessed in a prospective double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study, four open-label studies and one retrospective study in various treatment settings in the United States and Mexico, where scorpion envenomation is common. A total of 1534 patients ranging from less than one month to 90 years old were treated. The majority of patients (78%, 1204/1534) were pediatric, ranging from less than one month to 18.7 years of age. Male (52.3%) and female patients (47.7%) were equally represented. Treatment success was determined by resolution of clinically important signs of scorpion envenomation within four hours of starting infusion. The randomized placebo study enrolled 15 subjects, eight to the ANASCORP treated group and seven to the placebo. The symptom resolution success rate was 100% for the ANASCORP treated and 14.3% for the placebo group.<br/>
<br/>
A retrospective hospital chart review provided historical data from envenomated patients (N=97) who did not receive antivenom but were treated with sedatives and supportive care for symptoms of envenomation. These data were used as a historical control for expected outcomes in the absence of antivenom treatment. The historical controls were pediatric patients admitted to two pediatric intensive care units between 1990 and 2003 for the treatment of scorpion envenomation with supportive care only. The proportion of patients that required intensive care support four hours after intensive care unit admission, and the overall duration of the intensive care support requirement were calculated.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, 95-100% of patients were relieved of systemic signs associated with scorpion envenomation in less than four hours after initiating ANASCORP treatment. In the historical control database, only 3.1% of patients experienced relief of symptoms within 4 hours of hospital admission.<br/>
<br/>
In 1396/1534 patients the mean time from start of ANASCORP infusion to resolution of clinical signs and symptoms of envenomation was 1.42 hours (0.2 to 20.5 hours). Pediatric patients generally experienced a slightly faster time to resolution (1.28 ± 0.8 hours) compared with that of adult patients (1.91 ±1.4 hours). The time to resolution of symptoms was not affected by use of sedatives (474 patients who received sedatives resolved in 1.49 ± 1.1 hours and 922 patients who did not receive sedatives resolved in 1.38 ± 0.9 hours).</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">1.
