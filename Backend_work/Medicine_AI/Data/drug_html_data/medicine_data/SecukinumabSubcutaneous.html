This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For secukinumab, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to secukinumab or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of secukinumab injection in the pediatric population.

Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking secukinumab, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using secukinumab with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of secukinumab. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>

</ul><ul>

</ul><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of secukinumab</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you secukinumab. Secukinumab is given as a shot under your skin, usually on the upper arms, abdomen (stomach), or thighs.</p><p>Secukinumab comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Secukinumab may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital or clinic. If you are using secukinumab at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you how to prepare and inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand how to use the medicine.</p><p>Secukinumab comes in 3 forms: a <i>Sensoready® pen</i>, a <i>prefilled syringe</i> (both of which may be used at home), and <i>powder for solution</i> (which is to be used only in the hospital or doctor's office). Your doctor will tell you which dosage form you should use.</p><p>You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections. Do not inject into skin areas that are red, bruised, tender, hard, or affected by psoriasis.</p><p>Allow the medicine to warm to room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before using it.</p><p>You might not use all of the medicine in each pen or prefilled syringe. Use each pen or prefilled syringe only one time. Do not save an open pen or syringe. If the medicine in the pen or syringe has changed color, or if you see particles in it, do not use it. Do not shake the medicine.</p><p>The removable cap of the <i>Sensoready® pen</i> or <i>prefilled syringe</i> contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you have a latex allergy before you start receiving secukinumab.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of secukinumab will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of secukinumab. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Secukinumab may cause you to get infections more easily (eg, mouth, skin, or upper respiratory tract infections). It is important to check with your doctor if you have fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, painful or difficult urination, runny or stuffy nose, skin itching or scaling, or sores or white patches on your lips, mouth, or throat.</p><p>You will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start using secukinumab. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis test or been exposed to tuberculosis.</p><p>Inflammatory bowel disease may occur while you are using secukinumab. Tell your doctor right away if you have rectal bleeding, severe abdominal or stomach pain, or severe diarrhea while using secukinumab.</p><p>Secukinumab may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using secukinumab.</p><p>While you are being treated with secukinumab, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Secukinumab may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Secukinumab side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
