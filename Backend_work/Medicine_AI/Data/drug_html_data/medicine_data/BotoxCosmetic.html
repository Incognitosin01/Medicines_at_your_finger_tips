Botox injections should be spaced at least 3 months apart.</p><p>Botox injections may be given into more than one area at a time, depending on the condition being treated.</p><p>While receiving injections for eye muscle conditions, you may need to use eye drops, ointment, a special contact lens or other device to protect the surface of your eye. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>If you are being treated for excessive sweating, shave your underarms about 24 hours before your injection. Do not apply antiperspirant or deodorant for 24 hours before or after you receive the injection. Avoid exercise and hot foods or beverages within 30 minutes before the injection.</p><p>It may take up to 2 weeks after injection before neck muscle spasm symptoms begin to improve. You may notice the greatest improvement after 6 weeks.</p><p>It may take only 1 to 3 days after injection before eye muscle spasm symptoms begin to improve. You may notice the greatest improvement after 2 to 6 weeks.</p><p>The effects of a Botox injection are temporary. Your symptoms may return completely within 3 months. After repeat injections, it may take less and less time before your symptoms return, especially if your body develops antibodies to the botulinum toxin.</p><p>Do not seek botulinum toxin injections from more than one medical professional at a time. If you switch healthcare providers, tell your new provider how long it has been since your last botulinum toxin injection.</p><p>Using this medication more often than prescribed will not make it more effective and may result in serious side effects.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since botulinum toxin has a temporary effect and is given at widely spaced intervals, missing a dose is not likely to be harmful.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>Overdose symptoms may not appear right away, but can include muscle weakness, trouble swallowing, and weak or shallow breathing.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving Botox?</h2><p>Botox may impair your vision or depth perception.
