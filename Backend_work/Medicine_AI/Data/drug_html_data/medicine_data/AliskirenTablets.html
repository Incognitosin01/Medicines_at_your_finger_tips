Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with Aliskiren Tablets.</p><p>Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).</p><p>Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality have also been seen regularly.</p><p>Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (e.g., patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.</p><p>Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.</p><h2>Aliskiren Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Adult Hypertension</h3><p class="First">The usual recommended starting dose of Aliskiren Tablets is 150 mg once daily. In patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled, the daily dose may be increased to 300 mg. Doses above 300 mg did not give an increased blood pressure response but resulted in an increased rate of diarrhea. The antihypertensive effect of a given dose is substantially attained (85% to 90%) by 2 weeks.</p><h3>Relationship to Meals</h3><p class="First">Patients should establish a routine pattern for taking Aliskiren Tablets with regard to meals. High-fat meals decrease absorption substantially <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">150 mg Pink colored, film-coated, biconvex round tablets debossed with “E” on one side and “590” on the other side.</p><p>300 mg Brown colored, film-coated, ovaloid shaped biconvex tablets debossed with “E” on one side and “591” on the other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Do not use aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs in patients with diabetes <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14.3)].</span></p><p>Aliskiren Tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Aliskiren Tablets as soon as possible <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment/Hyperkalemia/Hypotension when Aliskiren Tablets are Given in Combination with ARBs or ACEIs</h3><p class="First">Aliskiren Tablets are contraindicated in patients with diabetes who are receiving ARBs or ACEIs because of the increased risk of renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and hypotension. In general, avoid combined use of aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, particularly in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 60 mL/min <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span><span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions and Head and Neck Angioedema</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylactic reactions and angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx have been reported in patients treated with Aliskiren Tablets and has necessitated hospitalization and intubation. This may occur at any time during treatment and has occurred in patients with and without a history of angioedema with ACEIs or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported from postmarketing experience with unknown frequency. If angioedema involves the throat, tongue, glottis or larynx, or if the patient has a history of upper respiratory surgery, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who experience these effects, even without respiratory distress, require prolonged observation and appropriate monitoring measures since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient to prevent respiratory involvement. Prompt administration of subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) and measures to ensure a patent airway may be necessary.</p><p>Discontinue Aliskiren Tablets immediately in patients who develop anaphylactic reactions or angioedema, and do not readminister <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Contraindications (4)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><h3>Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Aliskiren Tablets in patients with marked volume depletion, patients with salt depletion, or with combined use of aliskiren and other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Aliskiren Tablets, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision.</p><p>A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.</p><h3>Impaired Renal Function</h3><p class="First">Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with Aliskiren Tablets. Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, can be caused by drugs that affect the RAAS. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the RAAS (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, severe heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) or patients receiving ARB, ACEI or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors), therapy may be at particular risk for developing acute renal failure on Aliskiren Tablets <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function.</p><h3>Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First">Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving Aliskiren Tablets. Drugs that affect the RAAS can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes, combination use with ARBs or ACEIs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>, NSAIDs, or potassium supplements or potassium sparing diuretics.</p><h3>Cyclosporine or Itraconazole</h3><p class="First">When aliskiren was given with cyclosporine or itraconazole, the blood concentrations of aliskiren were significantly increased. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with cyclosporine or itraconazole <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span><span class="Italics">.</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Fetal Toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Anaphylactic Reactions and Head and Neck Angioedema <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
<li>Hypotension <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></li>
</ul><p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Adult Hypertension</p><p>Data described below reflect the evaluation of the safety of Aliskiren Tablets in more than 6,460 patients, including over 1,740 treated for longer than 6 months, and more than 1,250 patients for longer than 1 year. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event, including uncontrolled hypertension, occurred in 2.2% of patients treated with Aliskiren Tablets versus 3.5% of patients given placebo. These data do not include information from the ALTITUDE study which evaluated the use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Studies (14.3)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Angioedema:</span> Two cases of angioedema with respiratory symptoms were reported with Aliskiren Tablets use in the clinical studies. Two other cases of periorbital edema without respiratory symptoms were reported as possible angioedema and resulted in discontinuation. The rate of these angioedema cases in the completed studies was 0.06%.</p><p>In addition, 26 other cases of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body were reported with Aliskiren Tablets use including 4 leading to discontinuation.</p><p>In the placebo-controlled studies, however, the incidence of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body was 0.4% with Aliskiren Tablets compared with 0.5% with placebo. In a long-term active-control study with Aliskiren Tablets and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) arms, the incidence of edema involving the face, hand or whole body was 0.4% in both treatment arms <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> Aliskiren Tablets produces dose-related gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions. Diarrhea was reported by 2.3% of patients at 300 mg, compared to 1.2% in placebo patients. In women and the elderly (age 65 years and older) increases in diarrhea rates were evident starting at a dose of 150 mg daily, with rates for these subgroups at 150 mg comparable to those seen at 300 mg for men or younger patients (all rates about 2.0% to 2.3%). Other GI symptoms included abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and gastroesophageal reflux, although increased rates for abdominal pain and dyspepsia were distinguished from placebo only at 600 mg daily. Diarrhea and other GI symptoms were typically mild and rarely led to discontinuation.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cough:</span> Aliskiren Tablets was associated with a slight increase in cough in the placebo-controlled studies (1.1% for any Aliskiren Tablets use versus 0.6% for placebo). In active-controlled trials with ACE inhibitor (ramipril, lisinopril) arms, the rates of cough for the Aliskiren Tablets arms were about one-third to one-half the rates in the ACE inhibitor arms.</p><p><span class="Italics">Seizures:</span> Single episodes of tonic-clonic seizures with loss of consciousness were reported in 2 patients treated with Aliskiren Tablets in the clinical trials. One of these patients did have predisposing causes for seizures and had a negative electroencephalogram (EEG) and cerebral imaging following the seizures (for the other patient EEG and imaging results were not reported). Aliskiren Tablets was discontinued and there was no rechallenge.</p><p>Other adverse effects with increased rates for Aliskiren Tablets compared to placebo included rash (1% versus 0.3%), elevated uric acid (0.4% versus 0.1%), gout (0.2% versus 0.1%) and renal stones (0.2% versus 0%).</p><p>Aliskiren’s effect on ECG intervals was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active-controlled (moxifloxacin), 7-day repeat dosing study with Holter-monitoring and 12 lead ECGs throughout the interdosing interval. No effect of aliskiren on QT interval was seen.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Laboratory Findings</span></p><p>In controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with the administration of Aliskiren Tablets in patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI. In multiple-dose studies in hypertensive patients, Aliskiren Tablets had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, HDL, fasting triglycerides, or fasting glucose.</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood Urea Nitrogen, Creatinine</span>: In patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI, minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 7% of patients treated with Aliskiren Tablets alone versus 6% on placebo <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hemoglobin and Hematocrit</span>: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.08 g/dL and 0.16 volume percent, respectively, for all aliskiren monotherapy) were observed. The decreases were dose-related and were 0.24 g/dL and 0.79 volume percent for 600 mg daily. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin angiotensin system, such as angiotensin inhibitors and ARBs, and may be mediated by reduction of angiotensin II which stimulates erythropoietin production via the AT1 receptor. These decreases led to slight increases in rates of anemia with aliskiren compared to placebo were observed (0.1% for any aliskiren use, 0.3% for aliskiren 600 mg daily, versus 0% for placebo). No patients discontinued therapy due to anemia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Serum Potassium</span>: In patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI, increases in serum potassium greater than 5.5 mEq/L were infrequent (0.9% compared to 0.6% with placebo) <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Serum Uric Acid</span>: Aliskiren monotherapy produced small median increases in serum uric acid levels (about 6 micromol/L) while HCTZ produced larger increases (about 30 micromol/L). The combination of aliskiren with HCTZ appears to be additive (about 40 micromol/L increase). The increases in uric acid appear to lead to slight increases in uric acid-related AEs: elevated uric acid (0.4% versus 0.1%), gout (0.2% versus. 0.1%), and renal stones (0.2% versus 0%).</p><p><span class="Italics">Creatine Kinase</span>: Increases in creatine kinase of greater than 300% were recorded in about 1% of aliskiren monotherapy patients versus 0.5% of placebo patients. Five cases of creatine kinase rises, 3 leading to discontinuation and 1 diagnosed as subclinical rhabdomyolysis, and another as myositis, were reported as adverse events with aliskiren use in the clinical trials. No cases were associated with renal dysfunction.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been reported in aliskiren postmarketing experience. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reactions and angioedema requiring airway management and hospitalization</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Urticaria</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Peripheral edema</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic enzyme increase with clinical symptoms of hepatic dysfunction</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pruritus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Erythema</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Hyponatremia</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Nausea, Vomiting</span></p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Cyclosporine:</span> Avoid coadministration of cyclosporine with aliskiren <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Itraconazole:</span> Avoid coadministration of itraconazole with aliskiren <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors):</span> In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors with agents that affect the RAAS, including aliskiren, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving aliskiren and NSAID therapy.</p><p>The antihypertensive effect of aliskiren may be attenuated by NSAIDs.</p><p><span class="Italics">Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS):</span> The concomitant use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS such as ACEIs or ARBs is associated with an increased risk of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, particularly in patients with CrCl less than 60 mL/min. Monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients taking aliskiren and other agents that affect the RAAS <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5, 5.6)].</span></p><p>The concomitant use of aliskiren with an ARB or an ACEI in diabetic patients is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Furosemide:</span> Oral coadministration of aliskiren and furosemide reduced exposure to furosemide. Monitor diuretic effects when furosemide is coadministered with aliskiren.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Risk Summary</p><p>Aliskiren can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Considerations]</span>. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue aliskiren as soon as possible.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major malformations and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4%, and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p>Clinical Considerations</p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-associated</span> <span class="Italics">maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk</span></p><p>Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death.  Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.</p><p><span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal</span> <span class="Italics">adverse reactions</span></p><p>Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, oligohydramnios, fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death.  In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>In patients taking aliskiren during pregnancy, perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra- amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of gestation. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of <span class="Italics">in utero</span> exposure to aliskiren for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria or hypotension occur in neonates with a history of <span class="Italics">in utero</span> exposure to aliskiren, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and substituting for disordered renal function.</p><p>Data</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In developmental toxicity studies, pregnant rats and rabbits received oral aliskiren hemifumarate during organogenesis at doses up to 20 and 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), respectively, in rats and rabbits. (Actual animal doses were up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats and up to 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits.) No teratogenicity was observed; however, fetal birth weight was decreased in rabbits at doses 3.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). Aliskiren was present in placentas, amniotic fluid and fetuses of pregnant rabbits.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">There is no information regarding the presence of aliskiren in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.  Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including hypotension, hyperkalemia and renal impairment in nursing infants, advise a nursing woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Aliskiren Tablets.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 18 years old.</p><p>Preclinical studies indicate a potential for substantial increase in exposure to aliskiren in pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].</span> </p><p><span class="Bold">Neonates with a history of <span class="Italics">in utero</span> exposure to Aliskiren Tablets</span></p><p>If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of patients receiving aliskiren in clinical studies, 1,275 (19%) were 65 years or older and 231 (3.4%) were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. </p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Aliskiren Tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 30 mL/min] have not been established as these patients were excluded in clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Limited data are available related to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension. If symptomatic hypotension occurs, supportive treatment should be initiated.</p><p>Aliskiren is poorly dialyzed. Therefore, hemodialysis is not adequate to treat aliskiren overexposure <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Aliskiren Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Aliskiren Tablets contain aliskiren hemifumarate, adirect renin inhibitor. Aliskiren hemifumarate is chemically described as (2S,4S,5S,7S)-N-(2-carbamoyl-2-methylpropyl)-5-amino-4-hydroxy-2,7-diisopropyl-8-[4-methoxy-3-(3-methoxypropoxy)phenyl]-octanamide hemifumarate and its structural formula is:</p><p>Molecular formula: C<span class="Sub">30</span>H<span class="Sub">53</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span> • 0.5 C<span class="Sub">4</span>H<span class="Sub">4</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span><br/></p><p>Aliskiren hemifumarate is a white to slightly yellowish crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 609.8 (free base 551.8). It is soluble in phosphate buffer, n-octanol, and highly soluble in water.<br/></p><p>Aliskiren is available as film-coated tablets, which contains 165.765 mg or 331.530 mg aliskiren hemifumarate (equivalent to 150 mg or 300 mg aliskiren) and the following excipients: calcium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, hypromellose, iron oxide red, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, talc and titanium dioxide. In addition, the 150 mg strength contains iron oxide black.</p><h2>Aliskiren Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Renin is secreted by the kidney in response to decreases in blood volume and renal perfusion. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to form the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I). Ang I is converted to the active octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) by ACE and non-ACE pathways. Ang II is a powerful vasoconstrictor and leads to the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and prejunctional nerve endings. It also promotes aldosterone secretion and sodium reabsorption. Together, these effects increase blood pressure. Ang II also inhibits renin release, thus providing a negative feedback to the system. This cycle, from renin through angiotensin to aldosterone and its associated negative feedback loop, is known as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor, decreasing plasma renin activity (PRA) and inhibiting the conversion of angiotensinogen to Ang I. Whether aliskiren affects other RAAS components, e.g., ACE or non-ACE pathways, is not known.</p><p>All agents that inhibit the RAAS, including renin inhibitors, suppress the negative feedback loop, leading to a compensatory rise in plasma renin concentration. When this rise occurs during treatment with ACEIs and ARBs, the result is increased levels of PRA. During treatment with aliskiren, however, the effect of increased renin levels is blocked so that PRA, Ang I and Ang II are all reduced, whether aliskiren is used as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In placebo-controlled clinical trials, PRA was decreased in a range of 50% to 80%. This reduction in PRA was not dose-related and did not correlate with blood pressure reductions. The clinical implications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Aliskiren is poorly absorbed (bioavailability about 2.5%) with an approximate accumulation half-life of 24 hours. Steady state blood levels are reached in about 7 to 8 days.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption and Distribution</span></span></p><p>Following oral administration, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached within 1 to 3 hours. When taken with a high-fat meal, mean AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of aliskiren are decreased by 71% and 85% respectively. In the clinical trials of aliskiren, it was administered without requiring a fixed relation of administration to meals.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Elimination</span></span></p><p>About one-fourth of the absorbed dose appears in the urine as parent drug. How much of the absorbed dose is metabolized is unknown. Based on the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies, the major enzyme responsible for aliskiren metabolism appears to be CYP3A4.

<span class="Bold">What is high blood pressure (hypertension)?<br/></span><br/>
Blood pressure is the force in your blood vessels when your heart beats and when your heart rests. You have high blood pressure when the force is too great. High blood pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood through the body and causes damage to the blood vessels. Aliskiren Tablets can help your blood vessels relax so your blood pressure is lower. Medicines that lower your blood pressure lower your chance of having a stroke or heart attack.<br/>
