</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Iluvien Implant</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ILUVIEN®</span> (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) 0.19 mg is indicated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME) in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure.</p><h2>Iluvien Implant Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Dosing Information</h3><p class="First">For ophthalmic intravitreal injection.</p><h3>Administration</h3><p class="First">The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions, which include use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, a sterile caliper, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a broad-spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection.</p><p>The injection procedure for <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> is as follows:<br/>
<br/></p><p>Following the injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure and for endophthalmitis. Monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head immediately after the injection, tonometry within 30 minutes following the injection, and biomicroscopy between two and seven days following the injection. Patients should be instructed to report without delay any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> is a non-bioerodable intravitreal implant in a drug delivery system containing 0.19 mg fluocinolone acetonide, designed to release fluocinolone acetonide at an initial rate of 0.25 μg/day and lasting 36 months.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Ocular or Periocular Infections</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> is contraindicated in patients with active or suspected ocular or periocular infections including most viral disease of the cornea and conjunctiva including active epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, mycobacterial infections and fungal diseases.</p><h3>Glaucoma</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, who have cup to disc ratios of greater than 0.8.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any components of this product.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Intravitreal Injection-related Effects</h3><p class="First">Intravitreal injections, including those with <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span>, have been associated with endophthalmitis, eye inflammation, increased intraocular pressure, and retinal detachments. Patients should be monitored following the intravitreal injection <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Steroid-related Effects</h3><p class="First">Use of corticosteroids including <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, increased intraocular pressure and glaucoma.<br/>
Use of corticosteroids may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi, or viruses.</p><p>Corticosteroids are not recommended to be used in patients with a history of ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for reactivation of the viral infection.</p><h3>Risk of Implant Migration</h3><p class="First">Patients in whom the posterior capsule of the lens is absent or has a tear are at risk of implant migration into the anterior chamber.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Adverse reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids including <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> include cataract formation and subsequent cataract surgery, elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera.</p><p><span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> was studied in two multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled, masked trials in which patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) were treated with either ILUVIEN (n=375) or sham (n=185).</p><p>Table 1 summarizes safety data available when the last subject completed the last 36 month follow up visit for the two primary <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> trials. In these trials, subjects were eligible for retreatment no earlier than 12 months after study entry. Over the three year follow up period, approximately 75% of the <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> treated subjects received only one <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> implant.</p><p>The most common ocular (study eye) and non-ocular adverse reactions are shown in Tables 1 and 2:</p><p class="Italics Underline">Increased intraocular Pressure</p><p><span class="ParagraphCaption">Figure 1: Mean IOP during the study</span></p><p></p><p><span class="Italics Underline">Cataracts and Cataract Surgery</span><br/>
At baseline, 235 of the 375 <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> subjects were phakic; 121 of 185 sham-controlled subjects were phakic. The incidence of cataract development in patients who had a phakic study eye was higher in the <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> group (82%) compared with Sham (50%). The median time of cataract being reported as an adverse event was approximately 12 months in the <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> group and 19 months in the Sham group. Among these patients, 80% of <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> subjects vs. 27% of sham-controlled subjects underwent cataract surgery, generally within the first 18 months (Median Month 15 for both <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> group and for Sham) of the studies.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following reactions have been identified during post-marketing use of <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily estimates of frequency cannot be made. The reactions, which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span>, or a combination of these factors, include reports of drug administration error and reports of the drug being ineffective.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with fluocinolone acetonide. Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Systemically administered corticosteroids are present in human milk and could suppress growth and interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production. The systemic concentration of fluocinolone acetonide following intravitreal treatment with <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> is low [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. It is not known whether intravitreal treatment with <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Exercise caution when <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>Iluvien Implant Description</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> is a sterile non-bioerodable intravitreal implant containing 0.19 mg (190 mcg) fluocinolone acetonide in a 36-month sustained-release drug delivery system. <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> is designed to release fluocinolone acetonide at an initial rate of 0.25 µg/day. <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> is preloaded into a single-use applicator to facilitate injection of the implant directly into the vitreous. The drug substance is a synthetic corticosteroid, fluocinolone acetonide.</p><p>The chemical name for fluocinolone acetonide is (6α,11β, 16α)-6,9-difluoro-11,21-dihydroxy-16,17-[(1-methylethylidene)bis-(oxy)]-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione. Its chemical structure is:</p><p></p><p>MW 452.50; molecular formula C<span class="Sub">24</span>H<span class="Sub">30</span>F<span class="Sub">2</span>0<span class="Sub">6</span></p><p>Fluocinolone acetonide is a white or almost white, microcrystalline powder, practically insoluble in water, soluble in methanol, ethanol, chloroform and acetone, and sparingly soluble in ether.</p><p>Each <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> consists of a light brown 3.5mm x 0.37mm implant containing 0.19 mg of the active ingredient fluocinolone acetonide and the following inactive ingredients: polyimide tube, polyvinyl alcohol, silicone adhesive and water for injection.</p><h2>Iluvien Implant - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Corticosteroids inhibit inflammatory responses to a variety of inciting agents including multiple inflammatory cytokines. They inhibit edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation.</p><p>Corticosteroids are thought to act by inhibition of phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span> via induction of inhibitory proteins collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting release of the common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">In a human pharmacokinetic study of <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span>, fluocinolone acetonide concentrations in plasma were below the lower limit of quantitation of the assay (100 pg/mL) at all post-administration time points from Day 7 through Month 36 following intravitreal administration of a 0.2 mcg/day or 0.5 mcg/day fluocinolone acetonide insert.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to determine the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span>.</p><p>Fluocinolone acetonide was not genotoxic <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in the Ames test (S. typhimurium and E. coli) and the mouse lymphoma TK assay, or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> was assessed in two three year, randomized (2:1, active: sham), multicenter, double-masked, parallel-groups studies that enrolled patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) that had previously been treated with laser photocoagulation.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was the proportion of subjects in whom vision had improved by 15 letters or more from baseline after 24 months of follow-up.</p><p>Visual acuity outcomes by lens status (Phakic or Pseudophakic) at different visits are presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3. The occurrence of cataracts impacted visual acuity during the study. Patients who were pseudophakic at baseline achieved greater mean BCVA change from baseline at the Month 24 study visit.</p><p><span class="ParagraphCaption">Figure 2: Proportion of subjects with &gt;=15 Letters Improvement from Baseline BCVA in the Study Eye</span></p><p></p><p><span class="ParagraphCaption">Figure 3: Mean BCVA Change from Baseline</span></p><p></p><p>The BCVA outcomes for the Pseudophakic and Phakic subgroups from Studies 1 and 2 at Month 24 are presented in Table 5.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ILUVIEN®</span> (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) 0.19 mg is supplied in a sterile single use preloaded applicator with a 25-gauge needle, packaged in a tray sealed with a lid inside a carton.</p><p>NDC 68611-190-02</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Storage:</span> Store at 15° - 30° C (59° - 86° F).</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Steroid-related Effects</span><br/>
Advise patients that a cataract may occur after treatment with <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span>. If this occurs, advise patients that their vision will decrease, and they will need an operation to remove the cataract and restore their vision.</p><p>Advise patients that they may develop increased intraocular pressure with <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span> treatment, and the increased IOP may need to be managed with eye drops, or surgery.</p><p><span class="Bold">Intravitreal Injection-related Effects</span><br/>
Advise patients that in the days following intravitreal injection of <span class="Bold">ILUVIEN</span>, patients are at risk for potential complications including in particular, but not limited to, the development of endophthalmitis or elevated intraocular pressure.</p><p><span class="Bold">When to Seek Physician Advice</span><br/>
Advise patients that if the eye becomes red, sensitive to light, painful, or develops a change in vision, they should seek immediate care from an ophthalmologist.</p><p><span class="Bold">Driving and Using Machines</span><br/>
Inform patients that they may experience temporary visual blurring after receiving an intravitreal injection. Advise patients not to drive or use machines until this has been resolved.<br/>
