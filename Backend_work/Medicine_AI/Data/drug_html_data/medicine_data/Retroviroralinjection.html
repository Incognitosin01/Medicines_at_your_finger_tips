This medicine is also given during pregnancy to prevent an HIV-infected woman from passing the virus to her baby. This medicine is not a cure for HIV or AIDS.</p><p>Retrovir may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You may develop <b>lactic acidosis,</b> a dangerous build-up of lactic acid in your blood. Get emergency medical help if you have unusual muscle pain, trouble breathing, irregular heartbeats, dizziness, vomiting, or if you feel cold, tired, or very weak.</p><p>Retrovir can lower blood cells that help your body fight infections and help circulate oxygen. This medicine can also cause severe or life-threatening effects on your liver.</p><p><b>Call your doctor if you have symptoms such as:</b> fever, flu symptoms, unusual tiredness, mouth sores, pale skin, cold hands and feet, upper stomach pain, dark urine, or jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Retrovir if you are allergic to it.</p><p>You may develop <b>lactic acidosis,</b> a dangerous build-up of lactic acid in your blood. This may be more likely if you have other medical conditions, if you've taken HIV medication for a long time, or if you are a woman. Ask your doctor about your risk.</p><p><b>Retrovir can also cause severe or life-threatening effects on your liver.</b> Tell your doctor if you have liver disease, especially hepatitis C.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>kidney disease;</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>a latex allergy (if you receive Retrovir injection);</p>
</li>

HIV can be passed to your baby if the virus is not controlled during pregnancy. Your name may be listed on a registry to track any effects of antiviral medicine on the baby.</p><p>Women with HIV or AIDS should not breast feed a baby. Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use  Retrovir?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Retrovir oral is taken by mouth, usually in combination with other antiviral medications.</p><p>Retrovir injection is given as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give you this injection if you are unable to take the medicine by mouth.</p><p>Retrovir oral can be taken with or without food.</p><p>Measure liquid medicine carefully, especially when giving  Retrovir to a baby. Use the dosing syringe provided, or use a medicine dose-measuring device (not a kitchen spoon).</p><p>Retrovir doses are based on weight in children. Your child's dose needs may change if the child gains or loses weight.</p><p>Retrovir can lower blood cells that help your body fight infections and help circulate oxygen in your body. You may get an infection or feel more tired than usual. Your blood will need to be tested often.</p><p>Use all HIV medications as directed and read all medication guides you receive. Do not change your dose or dosing schedule without your doctor's advice. Every person with HIV should remain under the care of a doctor.</p><p>Store Retrovir <b>oral</b> at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at one time.</p><p>Because you will receive  Retrovir in a clinical setting, you are not likely to miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using  Retrovir?</h2><p>Avoid drinking alcohol. It may increase your risk of liver damage or lactic acidosis.</p><p>Using  Retrovir will not prevent your disease from spreading. Do not have unprotected sex or share razors or toothbrushes. Talk with your doctor about safe ways to prevent HIV transmission during sex. Sharing drug or medicine needles is never safe, even for a healthy person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Retrovir side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction</b> (hives, difficult breathing, swelling in your face or throat) <b>or a severe skin reaction</b> (fever, sore throat, burning in your eyes, skin pain, red or purple skin rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling).</p><p><b>Mild symptoms of lactic acidosis may worsen over time</b>, and this condition can be fatal.
