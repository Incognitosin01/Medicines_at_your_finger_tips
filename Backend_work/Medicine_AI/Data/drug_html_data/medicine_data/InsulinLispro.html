Insulin lispro is a fast-acting insulin that starts to work about 15 minutes after injection, peaks in about 1 hour, and keeps working for 2 to 4 hours.</p><p>Insulin lispro is used to improve blood sugar control in adults and children with diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Admelog and HumaLOG are used to treat type 2 diabetes in adults, or type 1 diabetes in adults and children who are at least 3 years old.</p><p>Lyumjev is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not share your Insulin lispro with another person. This includes any pens, cartridge devices, needles, or syringes, even if the needle has been changed. Sharing may pass infections from one person to another. This includes infections you may not know you have.</b></p><p>Low blood sugar may happen with insulin lispro. Very low blood sugar can lead to seizures, passing out, long lasting brain damage, and sometimes death.</p><p>Low blood potassium may also happen with insulin lispro. If not treated, this can lead to a heartbeat that is not normal, very bad breathing problems, and sometimes death.</p><p>It may be harder to control blood sugar during times of stress such as fever, infection, injury, or surgery. A change in physical activity, exercise, or diet may also affect blood sugar.</p><p>Do not drive if your blood sugar has been low. There is a greater chance of you having a crash.</p><p>Talk with your doctor before you drink alcohol or take products that have alcohol in them.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use insulin lispro if you are allergic to it, or if you are having an episode of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).</p><p>Insulin lispro should not be given to a child younger than 3 years old. Insulin lispro should not be used to treat type 2 diabetes in a child of any age.</p><p>To make sure Insulin lispro is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets.</p><p>Insulin lispro is injected under the skin with a syringe and needle, an injection pen, or with an infusion pump.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Prepare your injection only when you are ready to give it.
