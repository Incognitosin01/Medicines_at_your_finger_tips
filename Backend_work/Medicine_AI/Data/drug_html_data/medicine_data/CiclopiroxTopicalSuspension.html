The biological half life was 1.7 hours and excretion occurred via the kidney. Two days after application only 0.01% of the dose applied could be found in the urine. Fecal excretion was negligible. Autoradiographic studies with human cadaver skin showed that ciclopirox penetrates into the hair and through the epidermis and hair follicles into the sebaceous glands and dermis, while a portion of the drug remains in the stratum corneum.</p><p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> penetration studies in frozen or fresh excised human cadaver and pig skin indicated that the penetration of Ciclopirox Topical Suspension, USP 0.77% is equivalent to that of Ciclopirox Cream, 0.77%. Therapeutic equivalence of cream and suspension formulations also was indicated by studies of experimentally induced guinea pig and human trichophytosis.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Ciclopirox Topical Suspension</h2><p class="BasicParagraph First">Ciclopirox Topical Suspension, USP 0.77% is indicated for the topical treatment of the following dermal infections: tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis due to <span class="Italics">Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum,</span> and <span class="Italics">Microsporum canis;</span> ; cutaneous candidiasis (moniliasis) due to <span class="Italics">Candida albicans;</span> and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor due to <span class="Italics">Malassezia furfur.</span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="BasicParagraph First">Ciclopirox Topical Suspension, USP 0.77% is contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its components.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="BasicParagraph First">Ciclopirox Topical Suspension, USP 0.77% is not for ophthalmic use.</p><h3>PRECAUTIONS</h3><p class="BasicParagraph First">If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur with the use of Ciclopirox Topical Suspension, USP 0.77%, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="BasicParagraph First">The patient should be told to:</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="BasicParagraph First">A 104-week dermal carcinogenicity study in mice was conducted with ciclopirox cream applied at doses up to 1.93% (100 mg/kg/day or 300 mg/m2/day). No increase in drug related neoplasms was noted when compared to control.</p><p class="BasicParagraph">The following <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> genotoxicity tests have been conducted with ciclopirox: evaluation of gene mutation in the Ames Salmonella and E. coli assays (negative); chromosome aberration assays in V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells, with and without metabolic activation (positive); chromosome aberration assays in V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells in the presence of supplemental Fe3+, with and without metabolic activation (negative); gene mutation assays in the HGPRT-test with V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells (negative); and a primary DNA damage assay (i.e., unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in A549 human cells) (negative).
