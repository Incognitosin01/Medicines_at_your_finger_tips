Insulin glulisine is a fast-acting insulin that starts to work about 15 minutes after injection, peaks in about 1 hour, and keeps working for 2 to 4 hours.</p><p>Insulin glulisine is used to improve blood sugar control in adults and children with diabetes mellitus. Insulin glulisine is used to treat type 1 or type 2 diabetes in adults, and type 1 diabetes children who are at least 4 years old.</p><p>Insulin glulisine may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Never share an injection pen or syringe with another person, even if the needle has been changed.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use insulin glulisine if you are allergic to it, or if you are having an episode of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).</p><p>Insulin glulisine is not approved for use by anyone younger than 4 years old, and <b>should not be used to treat type 2 diabetes in a child of any age.</b></p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Taking certain oral diabetes medicines while you are using insulin may increase your risk of serious heart problems.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about using insulin <b>if you are pregnant or you become pregnant.</b> Controlling diabetes is very important during pregnancy, and having high blood sugar may cause complications in both the mother and the baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use insulin glulisine?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Insulin glulisine is injected under the skin, or given as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give your first dose and may teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine and injection pen or insulin pump.
