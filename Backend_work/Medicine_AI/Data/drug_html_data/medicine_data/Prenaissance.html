Each softgel is brown in color, opaque and imprinted with “341” on one side.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">EACH SOFTGEL CONTAINS:</span></p><h3>OTHER INGREDIENTS:</h3><p class="First">gelatin, glycerin, purified water, soybean oil, lecithin, yellow bees wax, natural creamy orange flavor, titanium dioxide, FD&amp;C red #40, ethyl vanillin, FD&amp;C yellow #5, FD&amp;C blue #1.</p><h2>INDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Prenaissance Capsules are a multivitamin/multimineral nutritional supplement with DHA indicated for use in the dietary management of patients with nutritional deficiencies or are in need of nutritional supplementation.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. Do not take this product if you are presently taking mineral oil, unless directed by a physician.</p><h2>WARNING:</h2><p class="First">Ingestion of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids (such as DHA) per day has been shown to have potential antithrombotic effects, including an increased bleeding time and International Normalized Ratio (INR).

Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is deficient.
