This vaccine works by exposing you to an antigen protein that causes your body to develop immunity to the disease. BioThrax vaccine does not contain live or killed forms of the bacteria that causes anthrax.</p><p>BioThrax will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>Like any vaccine, BioThrax may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2>What is anthrax?</h2><p>Anthrax is a disease caused by infection with spore-forming bacteria called Bacillus anthracis, which occur naturally in soil. These bacteria most often infect animals such as sheep, goats, cattle, deer, antelope, and other herbivores. Anthrax disease can occur in people who are exposed to an infected animal or other source of anthrax bacteria.</p><p>Anthrax is most common in agricultural regions lacking in good veterinary prevention programs, especially in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Southeastern Europe. Although less common, anthrax does occur in the United States among both wild game animals and domestic livestock.</p><p>Anthrax is spread to a human through the skin, the stomach, or the lungs. The bacteria can enter the skin through a cut or wound that comes into contact with products from an infected animal (such as meat, wool, hide, or hair). Infection can also occur through the lungs when a person inhales the bacterial spore, or through the stomach when a person eats undercooked meat from an infected animal. Anthrax is a serious disease that can spread quickly throughout the body and it is fatal in a high number of cases, especially when acquired through the lungs.</p><p>BioThrax is used to help prevent anthrax disease in adults. Anthrax vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>BioThrax is used before exposure in people who may come into contact with anthrax bacteria in certain work settings, while traveling, or during military service. BioThrax is used together with antibiotics after exposure in people who have already come into contact with anthrax bacteria.</p><p>BioThrax works by exposing you to an antigen protein that causes your body to develop immunity to the disease. Anthrax vaccine does not contain live or killed forms of the bacteria that causes anthrax.</p><p>Like any vaccine, the anthrax vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive BioThrax if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to an anthrax vaccine, or if you have ever had anthrax disease acquired through the skin.</p><p>Before receiving BioThrax, tell the doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a vaccine, or if you have a weak immune system, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, if you are allergic to latex rubber, if you are receiving chemotherapy or radiation, or if you have a history of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome.</p><p>You can still receive a vaccine if you have a cold or mild fever. In the case of a more severe illness with a high fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving BioThrax.</p><p>Before receiving BioThrax, tell the doctor about all other vaccines you have recently received. Also tell the doctor if you have recently received drugs or treatments that can weaken the immune system, such as steroids, psoriasis or arthritis medications, medicines to treat or prevent organ transplant rejection, or chemotherapy or radiation treatments. You may not be able to receive the BioThrax, or may need to wait until the other treatments are finished.</p><p>Becoming infected with anthrax is much more dangerous to your health than receiving the vaccine to protect against it. Like any medicine, BioThrax can cause side effects, but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.</p><p>BioThrax will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><h2>Before receiving BioThrax</h2><p>You should not receive BioThrax vaccine if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to an anthrax vaccine.</p><p>To make sure BioThrax is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>an allergy to latex, aluminum hydroxide, benzothonium chloride, or formaldehyde;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a weak immune system caused by receiving certain medicines such as steroids, chemotherapy or radiation; or</p>
</li>
<li>

However, not vaccinating the mother could be more harmful to the baby if the mother becomes infected with a disease that BioThrax could prevent. Your doctor will decide whether you should receive this vaccine, especially if you have a high risk of infection with anthrax.</p><p>If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry. This is to track the outcome of the pregnancy and to evaluate any effects of anthrax vaccine on the baby.</p><p>It is not known whether anthrax vaccine passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><h2>How is BioThrax given?</h2><p>BioThrax vaccine is given as an injection (shot) into a muscle or under the skin.</p><p>BioThrax is recommended <b>before exposure</b> for adults age 18 through 65 in the following situations:</p><ul>
