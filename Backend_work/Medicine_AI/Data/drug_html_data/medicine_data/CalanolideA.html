Its safety and efficacy remain to be defined.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Clusiaceae (Mangosteen)</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>Calanolide A is a compound isolated from the latex of the tree Calophyllum lanigerum var. austrocoriaceum that grows in the rain forest of the Malaysian state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo. There are at least 200 species in the genus Calophyllum.McKee 1998, Shenon 1994, USDA 2016</p><h2>History</h2><p>Rain forests are a very promising source of natural medicines because of their vast diversity. It has been estimated that more than half of the world's 250,000 plant species exist in tropical rain forests. Searching for natural drugs in these areas, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) contracts scientists to gather specimens for analysis. In 1987, an Illinois team obtained samples from many trees, one of which was Calophyllum lanigerum. Four years later, the NCI discovered that a preparation from this gum tree was active against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).Defant 2015, Shenon 1994</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Plants from the genus Calophyllum have been shown to contain xanthones, steroids, triterpenes, coumarins, and benzopyrans. Calanolide A is considered a dipyranocoumarin, with nonnucleoside HIV-1 specific reverse transcriptase inhibiting properties. McKee 1998, McKee 1996 Many studies in this area discuss findings from the genus Calophyllum, and offer structural representations, related compounds and their derivatives, modifications of the molecule, etc.Galinis 1996, Kashman 1992, Ma 2008, McKee 1998, McKee 1996, Sekino 2004, Yu 2007, Zembower 1997 Calanolide A has been synthesized in the lab and was found to have similar actions to the natural product.Flavin 1996</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Antiviral activity</h3><p>Calanolide A and other related compounds from the genus Calophyllum have demonstrated antiviral activity including nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibition,Matthee 1999, Newman 1998 and activity against influenza H3N1 and H1N1 viruses.Rajasekaran 2013</p><p>Early interest in Calophyllum extracts in the management of HIV infections persists,Matthee 1999, Newman 1998 particularly as an option for clinically relevant mutant HIV strains.Usach 2013</p><p>Calanolide A is being investigated in phase I clinical trials for safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics.Creagh 2001, Usach 2013</p><h3>Other effects</h3><p>Calanolide A is being investigated as an anti-tumor agentDefant 2015 and for activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Liu 2015</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Calanolide A is an investigational anti-HIV drug that has been given in early clinical trials at an oral dose of 200 to 800 mg; however, it is not available for use.
