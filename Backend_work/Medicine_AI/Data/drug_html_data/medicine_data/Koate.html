</ul><h2>Indications and Usage</h2><p class="First">KOĀTE<span class="Sup">®</span> is a human plasma-derived antihemophilic factor indicated for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes or in order to perform emergency and elective surgery in patients with hemophilia A (hereditary Factor VIII deficiency).</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitation of Use</span></p><p>KOĀTE is not indicated for the treatment of von Willebrand disease.</p><h2>Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For intravenous use after reconstitution only.</span></p><h3>Dose</h3><ul>
<li>Dose and duration of treatment depend on the severity of the Factor VIII deficiency, location and extent of bleeding, and the patient’s clinical condition.</li>
<li>Each vial of KOĀTE is labeled with the actual Factor VIII potency in international units (IU). Calculation of the required dose of Factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that one IU of Factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma Factor VIII activity by approximately 2% of normal activity or 2 IU/dL.</li>
<li>The required dose can be determined using the following formula:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Dose (IU) = Body Weight (kg) x Desired Factor VIII Rise (% normal or IU/dL) x 0.5<br/></span><br/></li>
<li>Estimate the expected <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> peak increase in Factor VIII level, expressed as IU/dL (or % normal), using the following formula:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">              Estimated Increment of Factor VIII</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">(% normal or IU/dL) = [Total Dose (IU)/Body Weight (kg)] x 2<br/></span><br/></li>
<li>Patients may vary in their pharmacokinetic (e.g., half-life, in vivo recovery) and clinical responses. Base the dose and frequency on the individual clinical response.<br/></li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Control and Prevention of Bleeding Episodes</span></p><p>A guide for dosing KOĀTE for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes (1,2) is provided in Table 1. Consideration should be given to maintaining a Factor VIII activity at or above the target range.</p><h3>Preparation and Reconstitution</h3><h3>Administration</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For intravenous administration only</span></p><ul>
<li>If the dose requires more than one vial of KOĀTE:
<ul>
<li>Reconstitute each vial using a new transfer needle.</li>
<li>Draw up all the solution into a single syringe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Visually inspect the final solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is observed.</li>
<li>Attach the syringe to the connector end of an infusion set.</li>
<li>Administer intravenously. The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’s comfort level, and no faster than 10 mL per minute.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Reconstitute each vial using a new transfer needle.</li>
<li>Draw up all the solution into a single syringe.</li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">KOĀTE is available as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution in single-use vials of 250, 500 and 1,000 IU of Factor VIII activity. The actual Factor VIII potency is labeled on each KOĀTE vial.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"> <span class="following_xmChange">KOĀTE is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to KOĀTE or its components<span class="Italics">.</span><span class="Italics">[see Description (11)</span><span class="Italics">]</span></span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible. Early signs of hypersensitivity reactions, which can progress to anaphylaxis, may include angioedema, chest tightness, hypotension, rash, nausea, vomiting, paresthesia, restlessness, wheezing and dyspnea.  If hypersensitivity symptoms occur, discontinue use of the product immediately and administer appropriate emergency treatment.</p><h3>Neutralizing Antibodies</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to Factor VIII may occur. Monitor all patients for the development of Factor VIII inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If expected plasma Factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, perform an assay that measures Factor VIII inhibitor concentration. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span></span></p><h3>Intravascular Hemolysis</h3><p class="First">KOĀTE contains blood group isoagglutinins which are not clinically significant when small doses are used to treat minor bleeding episodes. However, when large and/or frequent doses of KOĀTE are given to patients with blood groups A, B, or AB, acute hemolytic anemia may occur, resulting in increased bleeding tendency or hyperfibrinogenemia. Monitor these patients for signs of  intravascular hemolysis and falling hematocrit. <span class="Italics">[see</span> Warnings and Precautions (5.5)<span class="Italics">]</span> Should this condition occur, leading to progressive hemolytic anemia, discontinue KOĀTE and consider administering serologically compatible Type O red blood cells and providing alternative therapy.</p><h3>Transmissible Infectious Agents</h3><p class="First">Because KOĀTE is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) agent and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. There is also the possibility that unknown infectious agents may be present in the product. The risk that the product will transmit viruses has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing for the presence of certain current virus infections, and by inactivating and removing certain viruses during manufacture. Despite these measures, this product may still potentially transmit diseases.</p><p>Report all infections suspected by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product to Grifols Therapeutics LLC at 1-800-520-2807. </p><h3>Monitoring: Laboratory Tests</h3><ul>
<li>Monitor plasma Factor VIII activity levels by performing a validated test (e.g., one-stage clotting assay) to confirm that adequate Factor VIII levels have been achieved and maintained<span class="Italics">. [see</span> Dosage ad Administration (2.1)<span class="Italics">]</span></li>
<li>Monitor for the development of Factor VIII inhibitors. Perform a Bethesda inhibitor assay if expected Factor VIII plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with the expected dose of KOĀTE. Use Bethesda Units (BU) to report inhibitor levels.</li>
<li>Monitor for intravascular hemolysis and decreasing hematocrit values in patients with A, B or AB blood groups who are receiving large or frequent doses of KOĀTE.</li>
</ul><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most common adverse drug reactions (frequency ≥ 5 % of subjects) observed in the clinical trial were nervousness, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, paresthesia and blurred vision.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety assessment of KOĀTE is based on data from a 2-stage, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and efficacy clinical trial in which twenty subjects with severe hemophilia A (&lt;1% endogenous Factor VIII activity) were evaluable for safety. Nineteen subjects were enrolled in Stage I of the trial, including 15 Caucasian, 3 Hispanic, and 1 Black subjects. The mean age was 29 years (range: 13.9 – 46.4 years). Nineteen subjects, including the 18 subjects who completed Stage I, and one new subject were enrolled in Stage II. The mean age was 30 years (range: 13.9 – 46.4). The subjects received a total of 1053 infusions. Ten adverse reactions related to 7 infusions were reported in 4 subjects.  These were: nervousness (2 subjects [10%]), headache (1 subject [5%]), abdominal pain (1 subject [5%]), nausea (1 subject [5%]), paresthesia (1 subject [5%]), and blurred vision (1 subject [5%]).</p><p><span class="Bold">Immunogenicity</span></p><p>Subjects were monitored for neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to Factor VIII by the Bethesda assay at baseline and at 8, 17 and 26 weeks. No evidence of inhibitor formation was observed in the clinical trial.</p><p>The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, it may be misleading to compare the incidence of antibodies to KOĀTE in the study described above with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">Because postmarketing reporting of adverse reactions is voluntary and from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency of these reactions or establish a causal relationship to product exposure.<br/>

</ul><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data with KOĀTE use in pregnant women to inform on drug-associated risk. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted using KOĀTE. It is not known whether KOĀTE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. KOĀTE should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of KOĀTE in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for KOĀTE and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed infant from KOĀTE or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy studies have been performed in 20 previously treated pediatric patients aged 2.5 to 16 years. Subjects received 208 infusions of KOĀTE for treatment or control of bleeding episodes, including perioperative management, and routine prophylaxis. Children have shorter half-life and lower recovery of Factor VIII than adults. Because clearance of Factor VIII (based on per kilogram body weight) is higher in children, higher or more frequent dosing may be needed.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of KOĀTE did not include any subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Individualize dose selection for geriatric patients.</p><h2>Koate Description</h2><p class="First">KOĀTE, Antihemophilic Factor (Human), is a sterile, stable, dried concentrate of human antihemophilic factor  in lyophilized powder form for reconstitution for intravenous injection.  The product is supplied in single-use vials containing nominally 250, 500, or 1,000 international units (IU or units). Each vial of KOĀTE is labeled with the actual amount of Factor VIII expressed in IU. One IU is defined by the current World Health Organization International Standard for Factor VIII concentrate, which can be traced to the level of Factor VIII found in 1 mL of fresh pooled human plasma. The final product when reconstituted as directed contains not more than (NMT) 1500 μg/mL polyethylene glycol (PEG), NMT 0.05 M glycine, NMT 25 μg/mL polysorbate 80, NMT 5 μg/g tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), NMT 3 mM calcium, NMT 1 μg/mL aluminum, NMT 0.06 M histidine, and NMT 10 mg/mL human albumin.</p><p>KOĀTE is purified from the cold insoluble fraction of pooled human plasma; the manufacturing process includes solvent/detergent (TNBP and polysorbate 80) treatment and heat treatment of the lyophilized final container. A gel permeation chromatography step serves the dual purpose of reducing the amount of TNBP and polysorbate 80 as well as increasing the purity of the Factor VIII in KOĀTE to 300 to 1,000 times over whole plasma. When reconstituted as directed, KOĀTE contains approximately 50 to 150 times as much Factor VIII as an equal volume of fresh plasma. The specific activity after addition of human albumin is in the range of 9 to 22 units/mg protein. KOĀTE also contains naturally occurring von Willebrand factor, which is co-purified as part of the manufacturing process.</p><p>The KOĀTE manufacturing process includes two dedicated steps with virus inactivation capacity. The solvent/detergent treatment step has the capacity to inactivate enveloped viruses (such as HIV, HCV, HBV, and WNV). Heat treatment at 80ºC for 72 hours has the capacity to inactivate enveloped viruses (such as HIV and HCV) as well as non‑enveloped viruses (such as HAV and B19V). The polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation/depth filtration step has the capacity to remove both enveloped and non‑enveloped viruses. The accumulated virus reduction factors for KOĀTE manufacturing process are presented in Table 2.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Enveloped Viruses</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Non-enveloped Viruses</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HIV-1</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">BVDV</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRV</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">VSV</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WNV</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Reo3</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HAV</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PPV</span></p><p class="First">Model for</p><p class="First">HIV-1/2</p><p class="First">HCV</p><p class="First">Large enveloped DNA viruses (e.g., herpes virus)</p><p class="First">Enveloped RNA viruses</p><p class="First">WNV</p><p class="First">Non-enveloped viruses</p><p class="First">HAV</p><p class="First">B19V</p><p class="First">Global Reduction Factor</p><p class="First">≥ 12.0</p><p class="First">≥ 11.5</p><p class="First">≥ 10.8</p><p class="First">≥ 10.9</p><p class="First">≥ 5.9*</p><p class="First">≥ 9.9</p><p class="First">≥ 5.5</p><p class="First">4.8</p><p>Additionally, the manufacturing process was investigated for its capacity to decrease the infectivity of an experimental agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), considered a model for the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agents. The manufacturing process has been shown to decrease TSE infectivity of that experimental model agent (a total of 5.1 log<span class="Sub">10</span> reduction), providing reasonable assurance that low levels of vCJD/CJD agent infectivity, if present in the starting material, would be removed.</p><h2>Koate - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">KOĀTE temporarily replaces the missing clotting Factor VIII that is needed for effective hemostasis.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency of functional coagulation Factor VIII, resulting in a prolonged plasma clotting time as measured by the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay. Treatment with KOĀTE normalizes the aPTT over the effective dosing period.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics (PK) of KOĀTE were evaluated in a prospective, two-stage clinical trial of 20 previously treated patients (PTPs) with severe hemophilia A. In Stage I, the PK parameters for 19 subjects were based on plasma Factor VIII activity after a single intravenous infusion of 50 IU/kg of KOĀTE. Bioequivalence of the dry heat-treated KOĀTE to the unheated KOĀTE was demonstrated by comparison of C<span class="Sub">max</span> and the area under the curve, AUC<span class="Sub">0-48</span> (Table 3). The incremental <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> recovery ten minutes after infusion of dry heat-treated KOĀTE was 1.90% unit/kg (unheated KOĀTE was 1.82% units/kg). Mean biologic half-life was 16.1 hours.</p><p>In Stage II of the study, participants received KOĀTE treatments for six months on home therapy with a median of 52 days (range 23 to 94 days). At the end of 6 months, the mean AUC<span class="Sub">0-48</span> was 1471 ± 237 unit*hour/100 mL, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 99 ± 13 unit/100 mL, and the t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>was 16 ± 3.9 hours.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of KOĀTE for the treatment of bleeding episodes was demonstrated in a 2-stage, safety, PK and efficacy clinical trial. Stage I was a randomized, single-blind, single-dose, crossover, and PK study comparing heat-treated KOĀTE with unheated KOĀTE. Nineteen subjects were randomized and received a single dose of 50 IU/kg of either heated KOĀTE or unheated KOĀTE for PK assessment.  Stage II was a 6 month open-label safety study conducted at two hemophilia centers. Nineteen subjects received KOĀTE, including for on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes. The study populations included 15 Caucasians, 3 Hispanic, and 1 Black subject. A total of 306 bleeding episodes were treated, of which 82% were treated with a single infusion of Factor VIII.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">Srivastava A, Brewer AK, Mauser-Bunschoten EP, et al.
