An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic. Vivitrol is used as part of a treatment program for drug or alcohol dependence.</p><p>Vivitrol injection is used to prevent relapse in adults who became dependent on opioid medicine and then stopped using it. Naltrexone can help keep you from feeling a "need" to use the opioid.</p><p>Vivitrol injection is also used to treat alcoholism by reducing your urge to drink alcohol. This may help you drink less or stop drinking altogether. You should not be drinking at the time you receive your first naltrexone injection.</p><p>Vivitrol is not a permanent cure for drug addiction or alcoholism.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should be treated with Vivitrol <b>only if you have not recently used:</b> any opioid medicine, buprenorphine, methadone, or medicine to treat a cold, cough, diarrhea, or pain. Using these medicines in the 7 to 14 days before starting Vivitrol can cause sudden opioid withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>Do not use opioid medication, heroin, or other street drugs while you are receiving Vivitrol. Doing so could result in dangerous effects, including coma and death.</p><p>Call your doctor if you have ongoing or worsening pain, redness, itching, bruising, swelling, or a hard lump where the medicine was injected.</p><p>Naltrexone can harm your liver. Tell your doctor if you have upper stomach pain, dark urine, or yellowing in the whites of your eyes.</p><p>After receiving Vivitrol, your body will be more sensitive to opioids if you use an opioid medicine in the future. Using the same amount you used before could lead to overdose or death.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p><b>You should not receive a Vivitrol injection if you still use opioid medicine, or you could have sudden and severe withdrawal symptoms.</b></p><p>You should not be treated with Vivitrol if you are allergic to naltrexone, or if:</p><ul>

Tell your doctor about all your current medicines and any medicine you start or stop using.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="faq">Popular FAQ</h2><p>Naltrexone blocks the feelings of intoxication (the “buzz”) from alcohol when you drink it. This allows people with alcohol use disorder to lessen their drinking behaviors enough to stay in treatment, avoid relapses, and take their medication. Over time, cravings for alcohol will decrease. However, naltrexone will not prevent you from becoming impaired while drinking alcohol. Do not use naltrexone so that you can drive or perform other activities under the influence of alcohol. Continue reading</p><p>The manufacturer does not specify if you should take naltrexone tablets in the morning or at night. Take naltrexone exactly as your doctor orders it. Many patients take their medication in the morning to help affirm their continued treatment success for either opioid use disorder or alcohol use disorder. Taking naltrexone tablets after a meal (for example: breakfast) may help to lessen any stomach side effects such as nausea or pain. Continue reading</p><h3>More FAQ</h3><ul>
