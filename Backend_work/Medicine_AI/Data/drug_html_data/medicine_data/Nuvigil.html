Nuvigil has been reported to be associated with growth restriction (small fetus) and miscarriage. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p>Use a barrier form of birth control (condom or diaphragm with spermicide). Hormonal contraception (birth control pills, injections, implants, skin patches, and vaginal rings) will not effectively prevent pregnancy while you are taking Nuvigil.</p><p>It is not known whether Nuvigil passes into breast milk or if it could affect the nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding.</p><p>Nuvigil is not approved for use by anyone younger than 17 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take Nuvigil?</h2><p>Take Nuvigil exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Nuvigil may be habit-forming. <b>Never share Nuvigil with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction.</b> Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law.</p><p>Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>Nuvigil is usually taken each morning to prevent daytime sleepiness, or 1 hour before the start of a work shift to treat work-time sleep disorders.</p><p>You may take this medicine with or without food.</p><p>Nuvigil is usually given for up to 12 weeks. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>If you are taking this medicine to treat sleepiness caused by obstructive sleep apnea, you may also be treated with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. This machine is an air pump connected to mask that gently blows pressurized air into your nose while you sleep. The pump does not breathe for you, but the gentle force of air helps keep your airway open to prevent obstruction.</p><p>Do not stop using your CPAP machine during sleep unless your doctor tells you to. The combination of treatment with CPAP and Nuvigil may be necessary to best treat your condition.</p><p>Taking this medication does not take the place of getting enough sleep. Talk with your doctor if you continue to have excessive sleepiness even while taking this medicine. Nuvigil will not cure obstructive sleep apnea or treat its underlying causes. Follow your doctor's instructions about all your other treatments for this disorder.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>Keep track of the amount of medicine used from each new bottle.
