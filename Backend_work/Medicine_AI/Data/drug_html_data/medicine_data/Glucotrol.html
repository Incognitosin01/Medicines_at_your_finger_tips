However, you may need to stop taking Glucotrol for a short time just before your due date.</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2>How should I take Glucotrol?</h2><p>Take Glucotrol exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Take the regular tablet 30 minutes before your first meal of the day.</p><p>Take the Glucotrol XL extended-release tablet with your first meal of the day. Swallow the tablet whole and do not crush, chew, or break it.</p><p>Your blood sugar will need to be checked often, and you may need other blood tests at your doctor's office.</p><p>Low blood sugar <b>(hypoglycemia)</b> can happen to everyone who has diabetes. Symptoms include headache, hunger, sweating, irritability, dizziness, nausea, fast heart rate, and feeling anxious or shaky. To quickly treat low blood sugar, always keep a fast-acting source of sugar with you such as fruit juice, hard candy, crackers, raisins, or non-diet soda.</p><p>Your doctor can prescribe a glucagon emergency injection kit to use in case you have severe hypoglycemia and cannot eat or drink. Be sure your family and close friends know how to give you this injection in an emergency.</p><p>Also watch for signs of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) such as increased thirst or urination, blurred vision, headache, and tiredness.</p><p>Blood sugar levels can be affected by stress, illness, surgery, exercise, alcohol use, or skipping meals. <b>Ask your doctor before changing your dose or medication schedule.</b></p><p>When you take Glucotrol XL you may see something in your stool that looks like a tablet. This is the empty shell from the tablet. It is normal for the empty shell to pass with your bowel movement after medicine has been absorbed by your body.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose of Glucotrol for Diabetes Type 2:</b></p><p>Immediate release:<br/>
