It has no analgesic or addictive properties. The onset of antitussive action occurs in 15 to 30 minutes after administration and is of long duration.</p><p>Chlorpheniramine maleate competitively antagonizes most of the smooth muscle stimulation actions of histamine on the H1 receptors of the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels and bronchial muscle. It also antagonizes the action of histamine that results in increased capillary permeability and the formation of edema.</p><p>Phenylephrine hydrochloride acts predominantly by a direct action on alpha adrenergic receptors. In therapeutic doses, the drug has no significant stimulant effect on the beta adrenergic receptors of the heart. Following oral administration, constriction of blood vessels in the nasal mucosa may relieve nasal congestion. In therapeutic doses, the drug causes little, if any, central nervous system stimulation.</p><p>Guaifenesin promotes lower respiratory tract drainage by thinning bronchial secretions, lubricates irritated respiratory tract membranes through increased mucus flow, and facilitates removal of viscous, inspissated mucus. As a result, sinus and bronchial drainage is improved, and dry, nonproductive coughs become more productive and less frequent.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Cough suppressant, antihistamine, nasal decongestant, and expectorant as an aid in the management of cough and mucosal congestion or edema of the respiratory tract, or nasal passages due to the common cold, bronchitis, laryngitis, tracheitis, pharyngitis, pertussis, influenza, measles, or chronic paranasal sinusitis.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. Also contraindicated in patients with hypertension, hyperthyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, and patients on MAO inhibitor therapy (or for 14 days after stopping MAOI therapy).</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Use with caution in the presence of cardiac disorders, diabetes or peripheral vascular disease.</p><p><span class="Bold">Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately.</span></p><p>Stimulants, such as phenylephrine, are banned and tested for by the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether Quartuss™ Syrup can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Therefore, Quartuss™ Syrup should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Quartuss™ Syrup is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population, under 6, have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">May include drowsiness, dizziness, nervousness, insomnia, headache, palpitation, dysuria.</p><p><span class="Bold">Note:</span> Guaifenesin has been shown to produce a color interference with certain clinical laboratory determinations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA).</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Overdosage with Dextromethorphan HBr may produce CNS excitement and mental confusion.</p><p>Overdosage with sympathomimetic amines can cause hypertension, headache, convulsions, cerebral hemorrhage and vomiting. Premature ventricular beats and short paroxysms of ventricular tachycardia may also occur. Headache may be a symptom of hypertension. Bradycardia may also be seen early in phenylephrine HCl overdosage through stimulation of baroreceptors. Excessive CNS stimulation may result in excitement, tremor, restlessness, and insomnia. Other effects may include pallor, mydriasis, hyperglycemia, and urinary retention. Severe overdosage may cause tachypnea, or hypernea, hallucinations, convulsions, or delirium, but in some individuals, there may be CNS depression. Arrhythmias (including ventricular fibrillation) may lead to hypotension and circulatory collapse. Severe hypokalemia can occur, probably due to compartmental shift rather than depletion of potassium.</p><p>Should antihistamine effects predominate, central action constitutes the greatest danger. In the small child, symptoms include excitation, hallucination, ataxia, incoordination, tremors, flushed face and fever. Convulsions, fixed and dilated pupils, coma and death may occur in severe cases. In the adult, fever and flushing are uncommon; excitement leading to convulsions and postictal depression is often preceded by drowsiness and coma. Respiration is usually not seriously depressed; blood pressure is usually stable.</p><p>Overdosage with Guaifenesin is unlikely to produce toxic effects since its toxicity is low. Guaifenesin, when administered by stomach tube to test animals in doses up to 5 gm/kg, produced no signs of toxicity.</p><h3>Treatment</h3><p class="First">The patient should be induced to vomit (pharmacologic vomiting is the preferred method; by the administration of ipecac syrup), unless the patient is comatose, convulsing or has lost the gag reflex, in which case gastric lavage should be performed using a large bore tube. If indicated, follow with activated charcoal and a saline cathartic. Precautions must be taken against aspiration, especially in infants, children and comatose patients.</p><h2>Quartuss Syrup Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults and Children 12 years of age or older:</span> Two teaspoonfuls. <span class="Bold">Children 6 to 12 years of age:</span> One teaspoonful.
