</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Suprax Tablets</h2><h3>Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections</h3><p class="First">SUPRAX is indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by susceptible isolates of <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span> and <span class="Italics">Proteus mirabilis</span>.</p><h3>Otitis Media</h3><p class="First">SUPRAX is indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with otitis media caused by susceptible isolates of <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span>, <span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</span>, and <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes.</span> (Efficacy for <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span> in this organ system was studied in fewer than 10 infections.)</p><p>Note: For patients with otitis media caused by <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span>, overall response was approximately 10% lower for cefixime than for the comparator <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><h3>Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis</h3><p class="First">SUPRAX is indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with pharyngitis and tonsillitis caused by susceptible isolates of <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes.</span> (Note: Penicillin is the usual drug of choice in the treatment of <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span> infections. SUPRAX is generally effective in the eradication of <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span> from the nasopharynx; however, data establishing the efficacy of SUPRAX in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever is not available.)</p><h3>Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis</h3><p class="First">SUPRAX is indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused by susceptible isolates of <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> and <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae.</span></p><h3>Uncomplicated Gonorrhea (cervical/urethral)</h3><p class="First">SUPRAX is indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with uncomplicated gonorrhea (cervical/urethral) caused by susceptible isolates of <span class="Italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span> (penicillinase-and non-penicillinase-producing isolates).</p><h3>Usage</h3><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of SUPRAX and other antibacterial drugs, SUPRAX should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Suprax Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Adults</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of cefixime is 400 mg daily. This may be given as a 400 mg tablet or capsule daily or the 400 mg tablet may be split and given as one half tablet every 12 hours. For the treatment of uncomplicated cervical/urethral gonococcal infections, a single oral dose of 400 mg is recommended. The capsule and tablet may be administered without regard to food.</p><p>In the treatment of infections due to <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span>, a therapeutic dosage of cefixime should be administered for at least 10 days.</p><h3>Pediatric Patients (6 months or older)</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose is 8 mg/kg/day of the suspension. This may be administered as a single daily dose or may be given in two divided doses, as 4 mg/kg every 12 hours.</p><p>Note: A suggested dose has been determined for each pediatric weight range. Refer to Table 1. Ensure all orders that specify a dose in milliliters include a concentration, because SUPRAX for oral suspension is available in three different concentrations (100 mg/5 mL, 200 mg/5 mL, and 500 mg/5 mL).</p><p>Children weighing more than 45 kg or older than 12 years should be treated with the recommended adult dose. SUPRAX (cefixime) chewable tablets must be chewed or crushed before swallowing.</p><p>Otitis media should be treated with the chewable tablets or suspension. Clinical trials of otitis media were conducted with the chewable tablets or suspension, and the chewable tablets or suspension results in higher peak blood levels than the tablet when administered at the same dose.</p><p>Therefore, the tablet or capsule should not be substituted for the chewable tablets or suspension in the treatment of otitis media <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>In the treatment of infections due to <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span>, a therapeutic dosage of cefixime should be administered for at least 10 days.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">SUPRAX may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be employed in patients with creatinine clearances of 60 mL/min or greater. Refer to Table 2 for dose adjustments for adults with renal impairment. Neither hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis removes significant amounts of drug from the body.</p><h3>Reconstitution Directions for Oral Suspension</h3><p class="First">After reconstitution, the suspension may be kept for 14 days either at room temperature, or under refrigeration, without significant loss of potency. Keep tightly closed. Shake well before using. Discard unused portion after 14 days.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">SUPRAX is available for oral administration in the following dosage forms and strengths:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Film-coated tablets provide 400 mg of cefixime as trihydrate. These are white to off-white, film-coated, capsule shaped tablets with beveled edges and a divided score line on each side. The tablet is debossed with "SUPRAX" across one side and "LUPIN" across the other side.</li>
<li>Capsules provide 400 mg of cefixime as trihydrate. These are size "00EL" capsules with pink opaque cap and pink opaque body with "LU" on the cap and "U43" on the body in black ink. Capsules contain white to yellowish white granular powder.</li>
<li>Chewable tablets provide either 100 mg or 150 mg or 200 mg of cefixime as trihydrate. The 100 mg tablet is pink, round tablet, debossed with "SUPRAX 100" on one side and "LUPIN" on other side. The 150 mg tablet is pink, round tablet, debossed with "SUPRAX 150" on one side and "LUPIN" on other side. The 200 mg tablet is pink, round tablet, debossed with "SUPRAX 200" on one side and "LUPIN" on other side.</li>
<li>Powder for oral suspension, when reconstituted, provides either 100 mg/5 mL or 200 mg/5 mL or 500 mg/5 mL of cefixime as trihydrate. For 100 mg/5 mL and 200 mg/5 mL, the powder has an off white to pale yellow color and is strawberry flavored. For 500 mg/5 mL, the powder has an off white to cream color and is strawberry flavored.</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">SUPRAX<span class="Sup"> </span>(cefixime) is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to cefixime or other cephalosporins.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions (including shock and fatalities) have been reported with the use of cefixime.</p><p>Before therapy with SUPRAX is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other drugs. If this product is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients, caution should be exercised because cross hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs has been clearly documented and may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction to SUPRAX occurs, discontinue the drug.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including SUPRAX, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of <span class="Italics">C.</span> <span class="Italics">difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile,</span> and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Dose Adjustment in Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The dose of SUPRAX should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment as well as those undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD). Patients on dialysis should be monitored carefully <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>.</p><h3>Coagulation Effects</h3><p class="First">Cephalosporins, including SUPRAX, may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy, and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated.</p><h3>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing Suprax (cefixime) in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>5.6 Risk in Patients with Phenylketonuria</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). SUPRAX chewable tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. Each 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg strength contains 3.3 mg, 5 mg and 6.7 mg of phenylalanine, respectively. Before prescribing SUPRAX chewable tablets in a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including SUPRAX chewable tablets.</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The most commonly seen adverse reactions in U.S. trials of the tablet formulation were gastrointestinal events, which were reported in 30% of adult patients on either the twice daily or the once daily regimen. Five percent (5%) of patients in the U.S. clinical trials discontinued therapy because of drug-related adverse reactions. Individual adverse reactions included diarrhea 16%, loose or frequent stools 6%, abdominal pain 3%, nausea 7%, dyspepsia 3%, and flatulence 4%. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including diarrhea and loose stools, in pediatric patients receiving the suspension was comparable to the incidence seen in adult patients receiving tablets.</p><h3>Post-marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been reported following the post-approval use of cefixime. Incidence rates were less than 1 in 50 (less than 2%).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal</span></span></p><p>Several cases of documented pseudomembranous colitis were identified in clinical trials. The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity Reactions</span></span></p><p>Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions (including shock and fatalities), skin rashes, urticaria, drug fever, pruritus, angioedema, and facial edema. Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and serum sickness-like reactions have been reported.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hepatic</span></span></p><p>Transient elevations in SGPT, SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, hepatitis, jaundice.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Renal</span></span></p><p>Transient elevations in BUN or creatinine, acute renal failure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Central Nervous System</span></span></p><p>Headaches, dizziness, seizures.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hemic and Lymphatic System</span></span></p><p>Transient thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, prolongation in prothrombin time, elevated LDH, pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and eosinophilia.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Abnormal Laboratory Tests</span></span></p><p>Hyperbilirubinemia.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Other Adverse Reactions</span></span></p><p>Genital pruritus, vaginitis, candidiasis, toxic epidermal necrolysis.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions Reported for Cephalosporin-class Drugs</span></span></p><p>Allergic reactions, superinfection, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, and colitis.</p><p>Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2) and Overdosage (10)]</span>. If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Carbamazepine</h3><p class="First">Elevated carbamazepine levels have been reported in postmarketing experience when cefixime is administered concomitantly. Drug monitoring may be of assistance in detecting alterations in carbamazepine plasma concentrations.</p><h3>Warfarin and Anticoagulants</h3><p class="First">Increased prothrombin time, with or without clinical bleeding, has been reported when cefixime is administered concomitantly.</p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">A false-positive reaction for ketones in the urine may occur with tests using nitroprusside but not with those using nitroferricyanide.</p><p>The administration of cefixime may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine using Clinitest<span class="Sup">®</span>**, Benedict's solution, or Fehling's solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix<span class="Sup">®</span>** or TesTape<span class="Sup">®</span>**) be used. A false-positive direct Coombs test has been reported during treatment with other cephalosporins; therefore, it should be recognized that a positive Coombs test may be due to the drug.</p><p>**Clinitest<span class="Sup">®</span> and Clinistix<span class="Sup">®</span> are registered trademarks of Ames Division, Miles Laboratories, Inc. Tes-Tape<span class="Sup">®</span> is a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category B</span></span></p><p>Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 40 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to cefixime. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">Cefixime has not been studied for use during labor and delivery. Treatment should only be given if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether cefixime is excreted in human milk. Consideration should be given to discontinuing nursing temporarily during treatment with this drug.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of cefixime in children aged less than six months old have not been established. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including diarrhea and loose stools, in the pediatric patients receiving the suspension, was comparable to the incidence seen in adult patients receiving tablets.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. A pharmacokinetic study in the elderly detected differences in pharmacokinetic parameters <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. These differences were small and do not indicate a need for dosage adjustment of the drug in the elderly.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The dose of cefixime should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment as well as those undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD). Patients on dialysis should be monitored carefully <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Gastric lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. Cefixime is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of cefixime did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses.</p><h2>Suprax Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Cefixime is a semisynthetic, cephalosporin antibacterial for oral administration. Chemically, it is (<span class="Italics">6R,7R</span>)-7-[2-(2-Amino-4-thiazolyl)glyoxylamido]-8-oxo-3-vinyl-5-thia-1-azabicyclo [4.2.0] oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid, 7<span class="Sup">2</span>-(<span class="Italics">Z</span>)-[<span class="Italics">O</span>-(carboxy methyl) oxime] trihydrate.</p><p>Molecular weight = 507.50 as the trihydrate.

</ul><h2>Suprax Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Cefixime is a semisynthetic cephalosporin antibacterial drug <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">SUPRAX chewable tablets are bioequivalent to oral suspension.</p><p>Suprax Tablets and suspension, given orally, are about 40% to 50% absorbed whether administered with or without food; however, time to maximal absorption is increased approximately 0.8 hours when administered with food. A single 200 mg tablet of cefixime produces an average peak serum concentration of approximately 2 mcg/mL (range 1 to 4 mcg/mL); a single 400 mg tablet produces an average peak concentration of approximately 3.7 mcg/mL (range 1.3 to 7.7 mcg/mL). The oral suspension produces average peak concentrations approximately 25% to 50% higher than the tablets, when tested in normal <span class="Italics">adult</span> volunteers. Two hundred and 400 mg doses of oral suspension produce average peak concentrations of 3 mcg/mL (range 1 to 4.5 mcg/mL) and 4.6 mcg/mL (range 1.9 to 7.7 mcg/mL), respectively, when tested in normal <span class="Italics">adult</span> volunteers. The area under the time versus concentration curve (AUC) is greater by approximately 10% to 25% with the oral suspension than with the tablet after doses of 100 to 400 mg, when tested in normal <span class="Italics">adult</span> volunteers. This increased absorption should be taken into consideration if the oral suspension is to be substituted for the tablet. Because of the lack of bioequivalence, tablets should not be substituted for oral suspension in the treatment of otitis media <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>. Cross-over studies of tablet versus suspension have not been performed in children.</p><p>The 400 mg capsule is bioequivalent to the 400 mg tablet under fasting conditions. However, food reduces the absorption following administration of the capsule by approximately 15% based on AUC and 25% based on C<span class="Sub">max</span>.</p><p>Peak serum concentrations occur between 2 and 6 hours following oral administration of a single 200 mg tablet, a single 400 mg tablet or 400 mg of cefixime suspension. Peak serum concentrations occur between 2 and 5 hours following a single administration of 200 mg of suspension. Peak serum concentrations occur between 3 and 8 hours following oral administration of a single 400 mg capsule.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></span></p><p>Serum protein binding is concentration independent with a bound fraction of approximately 65%. In a multiple dose study conducted with a research formulation which is less bioavailable than the tablet or suspension, there was little accumulation of drug in serum or urine after dosing for 14 days. Adequate data on CSF levels of cefixime are not available.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Excretion</span></span></p><p>There is no evidence of metabolism of cefixime <span class="Italics">in vivo.</span> Approximately 50% of the absorbed dose is excreted unchanged in the urine in 24 hours. In animal studies, it was noted that cefixime is also excreted in the bile in excess of 10% of the administered dose. The serum half-life of cefixime in healthy subjects is independent of dosage form and averages 3 to 4 hours but may range up to 9 hours in some normal volunteers.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Special Populations</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Geriatrics:</span></span> Average AUCs at steady state in elderly patients are approximately 40% higher than average AUCs in other healthy adults. Differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters between 12 young and 12 elderly subjects who received 400 mg of cefixime once daily for 5 days are summarized as follows:</p><p>However, these increases were not clinically significant <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>. </p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment:</span></span> In subjects with moderate impairment of renal function (20 to 40 mL/min creatinine clearance), the average serum half-life of cefixime is prolonged to 6.4 hours. In severe renal impairment (5 to 20 mL/min creatinine clearance), the half-life increased to an average of 11.5 hours. The drug is not cleared significantly from the blood by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. However, a study indicated that with doses of 400 mg, patients undergoing hemodialysis have similar blood profiles as subjects with creatinine clearances of 21 to 60 mL/min.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>As with other cephalosporins, the bactericidal action of cefixime results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Cefixime is stable in the presence of certain beta-lactamase enzymes. As a result, certain organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalosporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases may be susceptible to cefixime.</p><p><span class="Bold">Resistance</span></p><p>Resistance to cefixime in isolates of <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span> and <span class="Italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span> is most often associated with alterations in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefixime may have limited activity against Enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas</span> species, <span class="Italics">Enterococcus</span> species, strains of Group D streptococci, <span class="Italics">Listeria monocytogenes,</span> most strains of staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), most strains of <span class="Italics">Enterobacter</span> species, most strains of <span class="Italics">Bacteroides fragilis,</span> and most strains of <span class="Italics">Clostridium</span> species are resistant to cefixime.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antimicrobial Activity</span></p><p>Cefixime has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1)].</span></p><p>Gram-positive Bacteria</p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span></p><p>Gram-negative Bacteria</p><p><span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Proteus mirabilis</span></p><p>The following <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for cefixime against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of cefixime in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.</p><p>Gram-positive Bacteria</p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus agalactiae</span></p><p>Gram-negative Bacteria</p><p><span class="Italics">Citrobacter amalonaticus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Citrobacter diversus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus parainfluenzae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Klebsiella oxytoca</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pasteurella multocida</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Proteus vulgaris</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Providencia</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Salmonella</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Serratia marcescens</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Shigella</span> species</p><p><span class="Bold">Susceptibility Testing</span></p><p>For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Lifetime studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted. Cefixime did not cause point mutations in bacteria or mammalian cells, DNA damage, or chromosome damage <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and did not exhibit clastogenic potential <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in the mouse micronucleus test. In rats, fertility and reproductive performance were not affected by cefixime at doses up to 25 times the adult therapeutic dose.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Comparative clinical trials of otitis media were conducted in nearly 400 children between the ages of 6 months to 10 years. <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> was isolated from 47% of the patients, <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span> from 34%, <span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</span> from 15% and <span class="Italics">S. pyogenes</span> from 4%.</p><p>The overall response rate of <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> to cefixime was approximately 10% lower and that of <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span> or <span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</span> approximately 7% higher (12% when beta-lactamase positive isolates of <span class="Italics">H. influenzae</span> are included) than the response rates of these organisms to the active control drugs.</p><p>In these studies, patients were randomized and treated with either cefixime at dose regimens of 4 mg/kg twice a day or 8 mg/kg once a day, or with a comparator. Sixty-nine to 70% of the patients in each group had resolution of signs and symptoms of otitis media when evaluated 2 to 4 weeks post-treatment, but persistent effusion was found in 15% of the patients. When evaluated at the completion of therapy, 17% of patients receiving cefixime and 14% of patients receiving effective comparative drugs (18% including those patients who had <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span> resistant to the control drug and who received the control antibacterial drug) were considered to be treatment failures. By the 2 to 4 week follow-up, a total of 30%-31% of patients had evidence of either treatment failure or recurrent disease.</p><p class="First Footnote">(a)Number eradicated/number isolated.<br/></p><p class="First Footnote">(b)An additional 20 beta-lactamase positive isolates of <span class="Italics">Haemophilus</span> <span class="Italics">influenzae</span> were isolated, but were excluded from this analysis because they were resistant to the control antibacterial drug. In nineteen of these, the clinical course could be assessed and a favorable outcome occurred in 10. When these cases are included in the overall bacteriological evaluation of therapy with the control drugs, 140/185 (76%) of pathogens were considered to be eradicated.<br/></p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">SUPRAX<span class="Sup">®</span> is available for oral administration in following dosage forms, strengths and packages listed in the table below:</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs, including cefixime, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When cefixime is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cefixime for oral suspension or cefixime chewable tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Counsel patients with phenylketonuria that SUPRAX chewable tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine as follows: Each SUPRAX chewable tablet contains 3.3 mg, 5 mg and 6.7 mg of phenylalanine per 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg strength, respectively.</p><p>Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><p class="First">ID#: 254614</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">SUPRAX<span class="Sup">®</span> CEFIXIME TABLETS USP</span></p><p>400 mg</p><p>Rx only</p><p>NDC 27437-201-10: Bottle of 10 Tablets</p><p>NDC 27437-201-25: Bottle of 2 Tablets [Physician Sample Pack]</p><p>NDC 27437-201-25: Carton for 2 Tablets [Physician Sample Pack]</p><p><span class="Bold">SUPRAX<span class="Sup">®</span> CEFIXIME CAPSULES</span></p><p>400 mg</p><p>Rx only</p><p>NDC 27437-208-08: Bottle of 50 Capsules</p><p>NDC 27437-208-11: Unit Dose Package of 10 (1 Blister of 10 Capsules)</p><p>NDC 27437-208-02: Single Dose Package of 1 (Blister of 1 Capsule)</p><p><span class="Bold">SUPRAX<span class="Sup">®</span> CEFIXIME CHEWABLE TABLETS</span></p><p>100 mg</p><p>Rx only</p><p>NDC 27437-203-10: Bottle of 10 Tablets</p><p>NDC 27437-203-11: Unit Dose Package of 10 (1 Blister of 10 Tablets)</p><p>NDC 27437-203-02: Unit Dose Package of 1 (1 Blister of 1 Tablet)</p><p><span class="Bold">SUPRAX<span class="Sup">®</span> CEFIXIME CHEWABLE TABLETS</span></p><p>150 mg</p><p>Rx only</p><p>NDC 27437-204-10: Bottle of 10 Tablets</p><p>NDC 27437-204-11: Unit Dose Package of 10 (1 Blister of 10 Tablets)</p><p><span class="Bold">SUPRAX<span class="Sup">®</span> CEFIXIME CHEWABLE TABLETS</span></p><p>200 mg</p><p>Rx only</p><p>NDC 27437-205-10: Bottle of 10 Tablets</p><p>NDC 27437-205-11: Unit Dose Package of 10 (1 Blister of 10 Tablets)</p><p>NDC 27437-205-02: Single Dose Package (Blister of 1 Tablet)</p><p><span class="Bold">SUPRAX<span class="Sup">®</span> CEFIXIME FOR ORAL SUSPENSION USP</span></p><p>200 mg/5 mL</p><p>Rx only</p><p>NDC 27437-206-05: Bottle of 25 mL</p><p>NDC 27437-206-04: Bottle of 10 mL [Physician Sample Pack]</p><p>NDC 27437-206-04: Carton for 10 mL [Physician Sample Pack]</p><p><span class="Bold">SUPRAX<span class="Sup">®</span> CEFIXIME FOR ORAL SUSPENSION USP</span></p><p>500 mg/5 mL</p><p>Rx only</p><p>NDC 27437-207-02: Bottle of 10 mL</p><p>NDC 27437-207-02: Carton for 10 mL</p><p>NDC 27437-207-04: Bottle of 10 mL [Physician Sample Pack]</p><p>NDC 27437-207-04: Carton for 10 mL [Physician Sample Pack]</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2><ul>
