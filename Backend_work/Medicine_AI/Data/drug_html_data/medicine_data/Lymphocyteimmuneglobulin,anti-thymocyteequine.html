The immune system helps your body fight infections. The immune system can also fight or "reject" a transplanted organ such as a liver or kidney. This is because the immune system treats the new organ as an invader.</p><p>Lymphocyte immune globulin is used to treat or prevent organ rejection after a kidney transplant. Lymphocyte immune globulin is also used to treat aplastic anemia (a condition in which your bone marrow does not produce enough new blood cells).</p><p>Lymphocyte immune globulin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You will receive this medicine in a hospital or clinic setting to quickly treat any serious side effects that occur.
