Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Do not take by mouth. Sinuva is for use only in your nose.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend you start using Sinuva 2 to 4 weeks before the start of allergy season.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Shake the <b>nasal spray</b> well just before each use. Before your first use, prime the nasal spray pump by spraying the medicine into the air until a fine mist appears. If the nasal spray has not been used for longer than 1 week, prime it by spraying the medicine into the air until a fine mist appears.</p><p>It may take up to 2 weeks before your symptoms improve. Keep using the medicine as directed and tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve.</p><p>To treat nasal polyps, mometasone can also be given in a small implant that is inserted into your nose. This implant is given in a medical setting. A healthcare provider will insert the implant using a special tool designed to accurately place the implant inside the nose.</p><p>The implant will slowly release mometasone into your nose over 90 days. You may also need to use saline nasal sprays or rinses to keep the implant moist. Follow all instructions about caring for your implant while it's in place.</p><p>The implant will gradually soften and it may come out while sneezing or blowing your nose. The implant can be removed at any time by your physician.</p><p>You will need frequent medical tests to make sure the medicine or the implant is not harming your nose or sinuses.</p><p>Store mometasone <b>nasal spray</b> in an upright position at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Throw the medicine away after you have used 120 sprays, even if there is still medicine left in the bottle.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Use the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>An overdose of  Sinuva is not expected to produce life threatening symptoms.
