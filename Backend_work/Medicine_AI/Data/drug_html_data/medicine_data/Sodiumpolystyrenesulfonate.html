This helps prevent your body from absorbing too much potassium.</p><p>Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is used to treat high levels of potassium in the blood, also called hyperkalemia.</p><p>Sodium polystyrene sulfonate works differently from other medicines because it passes into your intestines without being absorbed into your blood stream.</p><p>Sodium polystyrene sulfonate may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use  sodium polystyrene sulfonate if you have low potassium levels or a bowel obstruction.</p><p><b>Do not give this medicine orally (by mouth) to a newborn baby</b>.</p><p>Avoid taking other medicines by mouth within 3 hours before or 3 hours after you take sodium polystyrene sulfonate (or 6 hours before/after if you have slow digestion).</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use sodium polystyrene sulfonate if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p><ul>

Do not use the medicine orally or rectally in a baby who has slow digestion caused by surgery or by using other medicines.</p><p>To give this medicine orally: Mix the sodium polystyrene sulfonate powder with water, or with honey or jam to make it taste better. Avoid inhaling the oral powder while you are preparing a dose.</p><p>Do not mix the powder with any juice or other liquid that contains potassium, such as orange juice.</p><p>The rectal enema form of this medicine is usually given by a healthcare professional. The enema will be inserted slowly while you are lying down. You may need to hold in the enema for up to several hours. The sodium polystyrene sulfonate enema is usually followed with a second cleansing enema.</p><p>You will need frequent medical tests to help your doctor determine how long to treat you with sodium polystyrene sulfonate.</p><p>Keep using this medicine even if you feel fine. Hyperkalemia often has no symptoms that you will notice until your potassium levels are very low.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Use the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose.
