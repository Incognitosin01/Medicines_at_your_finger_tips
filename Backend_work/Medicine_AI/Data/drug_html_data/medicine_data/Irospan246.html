Adequate amounts of iron are necessary for effective erthropoiesis.  Iron also serves as a cofactor of several essential enzymes, including cytochromes that are involved in electron transport.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Folic acid is required for nucleoprotein synthesis and the maintenance of normal erthropoiesis.  Folic acid is converted in the liver and plasma to its metabolically active form, tetrahydrofolic acid, by dihydrofolate reductase.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Vitamin B12 is required for the maintenance of normal erthropoiesis, nucleprotein and myelin synthesis, cell reproduction and normal growth.  Intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the gastric mucosa, is required for active absorption of Vitamin B12 from the gastrointestinal tract.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">INDICATION AND USAGE:</span> Irospan 24/6 is indicated for the treatment of all anemias that are responsive to oral iron therapy.  These include: hypochromic anemia associated with pregnancy, chronic and/or acute blood loss, metabolic disease, post-surgical convalescence, and dietary needs.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Warnings:</span> Ingestion of more than 3 grams of omega-fatty acids per day has been shown to have potential antithrombotic effects, including increased bleeding time and INR. Administration of omega-3 fatty acids should be avoided in patients on anticoagulants and in those known to have an inherited or acquired bleeding diathesis.</p><p>Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B12 is deficient.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6.
