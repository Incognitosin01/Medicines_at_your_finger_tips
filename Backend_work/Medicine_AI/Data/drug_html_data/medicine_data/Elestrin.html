Estradiol is a form of estrogen, a female sex hormone made in the ovaries that regulates many processes in the body.</p><p>Elestrin is used after menopause to reduce moderate to severe hot flashes.</p><p>Ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 to 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the “change of life” or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). When estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating (“hot flashes”). In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe and treatment with products such as Elestrin may help.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>You should not use this medicine if you have:</b> undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, liver disease, bleeding problems, an increased risk of blood clots, if you will have major surgery, or if you have ever had a heart attack, a stroke, a blood clot, or cancer of the breast, uterus/cervix, or vagina.</p><p><b>Do not use Elestrin gel if you are pregnant.</b></p><p>Estradiol may increase your risk of developing a condition that may lead to uterine cancer. <b>Report any unusual vaginal bleeding right away.</b></p><p><b>Using Elestrin can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, or cancer of the breast, uterus, or ovaries.</b> Estradiol should not be used to prevent heart disease, stroke, or dementia.</p><p><b>Estradiol topical is absorbed through the skin and can cause side effects in a child who comes into contact with the skin where you have applied Elestrin gel.</b></p><p>You should not use Elestrin if you have:</p><ul>
