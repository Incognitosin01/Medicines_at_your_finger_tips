</ul><h2>Hycodan Oral Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Administer HYCODAN by the oral route only.</span></p><p>Always use an accurate milliliter measuring device when administering Hycodan Oral Solution to ensure that the dose is measured and administered accurately. A household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span>]. For prescriptions where a measuring device is not provided, a pharmacist can provide an appropriate measuring device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose. Do not overfill. Rinse the measuring device with water after each use.</p><p>Advise patients not to increase the dose or dosing frequency of HYCODAN because serious adverse events such as respiratory depression may occur with overdosage [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>, <span class="Italics">Overdosage (10)</span>]. The dosage of HYCODAN should not be increased if cough fails to respond; an unresponsive cough should be reevaluated for possible underlying pathology [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span>, <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>].</p><h3>Recommended Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults 18 years of age and older</span>: 5 mL of the oral solution every 4 to 6 hours as needed; not to exceed 30 mL in 24 hours.</p><h3>Monitoring, Maintenance, and Discontinuation of Therapy</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Prescribe HYCODAN for the shortest duration that is consistent with individual patient treatment goals [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></span></p><p>Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>Reevaluate patients with unresponsive cough in 5 days or sooner for possible underlying pathology, such as foreign body or lower respiratory tract disease [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>]. If a patient requires a refill, reevaluate the cause of the cough and assess the need for continued treatment with HYCODAN, the relative incidence of adverse reactions, and the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><p>Do not abruptly discontinue HYCODAN in a physically-dependent patient [<span class="Italics">see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)</span>]. When a patient who has been taking HYCODAN regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with HYCODAN, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Oral solution: Each 5 mL contains hydrocodone bitartrate 5 mg; and homatropine methylbromide 1.5 mg and available as a clear red colored, cherry flavored oral solution [<span class="Italics">see Description (11)</span>].</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">HYCODAN is contraindicated for:</span></p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">HYCODAN contains hydrocodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, HYCODAN exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [<span class="Italics">see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)</span>]<span class="Italics">,</span> which can lead to overdose and death [<span class="Italics">see Overdosage (10)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span> <span class="Bold">Reserve HYCODAN for use in adult patients for whom the benefits of cough suppression are expected to outweigh the risks, and in whom an adequate assessment of the etiology of the cough has been made. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing HYCODAN, prescribe HYCODAN for the shortest duration that is consistent with individual patient treatment goals<span class="Italics">,</span> monitor all patients regularly for the development of addiction or abuse, and refill only after reevaluation of the need for continued treatment.</span></span></p><p>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed HYCODAN. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression).</p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing HYCODAN. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [<span class="Italics">see Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, including hydrocodone, one of the active ingredients in HYCODAN. Hydrocodone produces dose-related respiratory depression by directly acting on the brain stem respiratory center that controls respiratory rhythm and may produce irregular and periodic breathing. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression includes discontinuation of HYCODAN, close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists (e.g., naloxone), depending on the patient's clinical status [<span class="Italics">see Overdosage (10)</span>]. Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</span></p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of HYCODAN, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy, when HYCODAN is used concomitantly with other drugs that may cause respiratory depression [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>], in patients with chronic pulmonary disease or decreased respiratory reserve, and in patients with altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance (e.g., elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients) [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>].</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing of HYCODAN is essential [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span>]. Monitor patients closely, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy or when used in patients at higher risk.</p><p>Overdose of hydrocodone in adults has been associated with fatal respiratory depression, and the use of hydrocodone in children younger than 6 years of age has been associated with fatal respiratory depression when used as recommended. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of HYCODAN, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death.</p><h3>Risks with Use in Pediatric Populations</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Children are particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of hydrocodone <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death, HYCODAN is contraindicated in children less than 6 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</span></p><p>Use of HYCODAN in children also exposes them to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]</span>, which can lead to overdose and death <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>, <span class="Italics">Overdosage (10)]</span>. Because the benefits of symptomatic treatment of cough associated with allergies or the common cold do not outweigh the risks of use of hydrocodone in pediatric patients, HYCODAN is not indicated for use in patients younger than 18 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Indications (1)</span>, <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Risks with Use in Other At-Risk Populations</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Unresponsive Cough</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">The dosage of HYCODAN should not be increased if cough fails to respond; an unresponsive cough should be reevaluated in 5 days or sooner for possible underlying pathology, such as foreign body or lower respiratory tract disease [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span>].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Asthma and Other Pulmonary Disease</span></p><p>The use of HYCODAN in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><p>Opioid analgesics and antitussives, including hydrocodone, one of the active ingredients in HYCODAN, should not be used in patients with acute febrile illness associated with productive cough or in patients with chronic respiratory disease where interference with ability to clear the tracheobronchial tree of secretions would have a deleterious effect on the patient's respiratory function.</p><p>HYCODAN-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of HYCODAN [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</span>: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</p><p>Because of the risk of respiratory depression, avoid the use of opioid antitussives, including HYCODAN in patients with compromised respiratory function, patients at risk of respiratory failure, and in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients. If HYCODAN is prescribed, monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating HYCODAN and when HYCODAN is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>].</p><h3>Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. To reduce the risk of overdose and respiratory depression, ensure that the dose of HYCODAN is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.1)</span>].</span></p><p>Advise patients to always use an accurate milliliter measuring device when measuring and administering Hycodan Oral Solution. Inform patients that household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and such use could lead to overdosage and serious adverse reactions [<span class="Italics">see Overdosage (10)</span>]. For prescriptions where a measuring device is not provided, a pharmacist can provide an appropriate calibrated measuring device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose.</p><h3>Activities Requiring Mental Alertness: Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Hydrocodone, one of the active ingredients in HYCODAN, may produce marked drowsiness and impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Advise patients to avoid engaging in hazardous tasks requiring mental alertness and motor coordination after ingestion of HYCODAN. Avoid concurrent use of HYCODAN with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants because additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>].</span></p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Concomitant use of HYCODAN with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of hydrocodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>], particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of HYCODAN is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in HYCODAN-treated patients may increase hydrocodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions.</span></p><p>Concomitant use of HYCODAN with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease hydrocodone plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to hydrocodone.</p><p>Avoid the use of HYCODAN in patients who are taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer. If concomitant use of HYCODAN with a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer is necessary, monitor patients for signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)</span>].</p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Concomitant use of opioids, including HYCODAN, with benzodiazepines, or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, avoid use of opioid cough medications in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.4)</span>].</span></p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. Because of similar pharmacologic properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with concomitant use of opioid cough medications and benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation if HYCODAN is used with benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other CNS depressants [<span class="Italics">see Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages, or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol, while on HYCODAN therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with HYCODAN may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of hydrocodone [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.1)</span>].</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">HYCODAN is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>]. The use of hydrocodone in HYCODAN may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.</span></p><p>The concurrent use of anticholinergics with HYCODAN may produce paralytic ileus [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.9)</span>].</p><p>The hydrocodone in HYCODAN may result in constipation or obstructive bowel disease, especially in patients with underlying intestinal motility disorders. Use with caution in patients with underlying intestinal motility disorders.</p><p>The hydrocodone in HYCODAN may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, resulting in an increase in biliary tract pressure. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)</span>]. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Head Injury, Impaired Consciousness, Increased Intracranial Pressure, or Brain Tumors</h3><p class="First">Avoid the use of HYCODAN in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), HYCODAN may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce adverse reactions that may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The hydrocodone in HYCODAN may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during HYCODAN therapy.</span></p><h3>Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">HYCODAN may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.4)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span> Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating HYCODAN.</span></p><p>In patients with circulatory shock, HYCODAN may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of HYCODAN in patients with circulatory shock.</p><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">HYCODAN is not recommended for use in pregnant women. Prolonged use of HYCODAN during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>, <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>].</span></p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</span></p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Because opioid agonists may increase biliary tract pressure, with resultant increase in plasma amylase or lipase levels, determination of these enzyme levels may be unreliable for 24 hours after administration of a dose of HYCODAN.</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:</p><ul class="Disc">

Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or nonprescription products containing alcohol while on HYCODAN therapy [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>, <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of HYCODAN and CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), or protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), can increase the plasma concentration of hydrocodone, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of HYCODAN and CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of HYCODAN is achieved [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</span>]. After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the hydrocodone plasma concentration will decrease [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to hydrocodone.</p><p>Avoid the use of HYCODAN while taking a CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor. If concomitant use is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.</p><h3>CYP3A4 Inducers</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of HYCODAN and CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, carbamazepine, or phenytoin, can decrease the plasma concentration of hydrocodone [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to hydrocodone [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</span>]. After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the hydrocodone plasma concentration will increase [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression.</p><p>Avoid the use of HYCODAN in patients who are taking CYP3A4 inducers. If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inducer is necessary, follow the patient for reduced efficacy.</p><h3>Benzodiazepines, and Other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First">Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Avoid the use of HYCODAN in patients who are taking benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>], and instruct patients to avoid consumption of alcohol while on HYCODAN [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.1)</span> and <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>].</p><h3>Serotonergic Drugs</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation. Discontinue HYCODAN if serotonin syndrome is suspected.</p><h3>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)</h3><p class="First">Avoid the use of HYCODAN in patients who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or have taken MAOIs within 14 days. The use of MAOIs or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone, one of the active ingredients in HYCODAN, may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone. MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma)<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Muscle Relaxants</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Avoid the use of HYCODAN in patients taking muscle relaxants. If concomitant use is necessary, monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected.</p><h3>Diuretics</h3><p class="First">Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.</p><h3>Anticholinergic Drugs</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs with HYCODAN may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)</span>]. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when HYCODAN is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>HYCODAN is not recommended for use in pregnant women, including during or immediately prior to labor.</p><p>Prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Clinical Considerations</span>].</p><p>There are no available data with HYCODAN use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes.

An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Opioids, including HYCODAN, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor.

Patients with renal impairment may have higher plasma concentrations than those with normal function [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. HYCODAN should be used with caution in patients with severe impairment of renal function, and patients should be monitored closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of HYCODAN has not been characterized in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment may have higher plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. Therefore, HYCODAN should be used with caution in patients with severe impairment of hepatic function, and patients should be monitored closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">HYCODAN contains hydrocodone, a Schedule II controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hydrocodone</span></p><p>HYCODAN contains hydrocodone, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including morphine and codeine.

Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Health care providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>HYCODAN, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risks Specific to Abuse of HYCODAN</span></p><p>HYCODAN is for oral use only.

Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome: restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Hydrocodone</span></p><p>Acute overdose with hydrocodone is characterized by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, hypotension, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death.</p><p>Hydrocodone may cause miosis, even in total darkness.

Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. Gastric emptying may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone and nalmefene, are specific antidotes for respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydrocodone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. An antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory depression. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydrocodone in HYCODAN, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information.</p><p>Hemodialysis is not routinely used to enhance the elimination of hydrocodone from the body.</p><p>Physostigmine may be used parenterally for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of homatropine toxicity.</p><h2>Hycodan Oral Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Hycodan Oral Solution contains hydrocodone, an opioid agonist; and homatropine, a muscarinic antagonist.</p><p>Each spoonful (5 mL) of HYCODAN contains 5 mg of hydrocodone bitartrate, USP and 1.5 mg of homatropine methylbromide, USP, for oral administration.</p><p>Hycodan Oral Solution also contains: anhydrous citric acid, FD&amp;C Red 40, methylparaben, natural and artificial cherry flavor, propylparaben, purified water, sorbitol solution, sodium citrate dihydrate and sucrose.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hydrocodone Bitartrate</span></p><p>The chemical name for hydrocodone bitartrate is morphinan-6-one, 4,5-epoxy-3-methoxy-17-methyl-, (5 )-, [R-(R*,R*)]-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioate (1:1), hydrate (2:5).

Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.2)</span>]. Published in vitro studies have shown that N-demethylation of hydrocodone to form norhydrocodone can be attributed to CYP3A4 while O-demethylation of hydrocodone to hydromorphone is predominantly catalyzed by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by an unknown low affinity CYP enzyme.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Hydrocodone and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in the kidneys.
