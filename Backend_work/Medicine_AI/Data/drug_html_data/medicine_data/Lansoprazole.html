Lansoprazole decreases the amount of acid produced in the stomach.</p><p>Lansoprazole is used to treat and prevent stomach and intestinal ulcers, erosive esophagitis (damage to the esophagus from stomach acid), and other conditions involving excessive stomach acid such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.</p><p>Over-the-counter lansoprazole (Prevacid OTC) is used to treat frequent heartburn that happens 2 or more days per week. This medicine is not for the immediate relief of heartburn symptoms.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Lansoprazole can cause kidney problems.
