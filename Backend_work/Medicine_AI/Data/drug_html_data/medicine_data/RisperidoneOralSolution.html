</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Risperidone is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Risperidone Oral Solution</h2><h3>Schizophrenia</h3><p class="First">Risperidone is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. Efficacy was established in 4 short-term trials in adults, 2 short-term trials in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years), and one long-term maintenance trial in adults [see <span class="Bold">Clinical Studies (14.1)</span>].</p><h3>Bipolar Mania</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Monotherapy</span></p><p>Risperidone is indicated for the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder. Efficacy was established in 2 short-term trials in adults and one short-term trial in children and adolescents (ages 10 to 17 years) [see <span class="Bold">Clinical Studies (14.2)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adjunctive Therapy</span></p><p>Risperidone adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate is indicated for the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder. Efficacy was established in one short-term trial in adults [see <span class="Bold">Clinical Studies (14.3)</span>].</p><h3>Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder</h3><p class="First">Risperidone is indicated for the treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder, including symptoms of aggression towards others, deliberate self-injuriousness, temper tantrums, and quickly changing moods. Efficacy was established in 3 short-term trials in children and adolescents (ages 5 to 17 years) [see <span class="Bold">Clinical Studies (14.4)</span>].</p><h2>Risperidone Oral Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Severe Renal and Hepatic Impairment in Adults: use a lower starting dose of 0.5 mg twice daily. May increase to dosages above 1.5 mg twice daily at intervals of one week or longer.</p><h3>Schizophrenia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Usual Initial Dose</span></p><p>Risperidone Oral Solution can be administered once or twice daily. Initial dosing is 2 mg per day. May increase the dose at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 1 to 2 mg per day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 4 to 8 mg per day. In some patients, slower titration may be appropriate. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a range of 4 mg to 16 mg per day. However, doses above 6 mg per day for twice daily dosing were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than lower doses, were associated with more extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse effects, and are generally not recommended. In a single study supporting once-daily dosing, the efficacy results were generally stronger for 8 mg than for 4 mg. The safety of doses above 16 mg per day has not been evaluated in clinical trials [see <span class="Bold">Clinical Studies (14.1)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adolescents</span></p><p>The initial dose is 0.5 mg once daily, administered as a single-daily dose in the morning or evening. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 0.5 mg or 1 mg per day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 3 mg per day. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in studies of adolescent patients with schizophrenia at doses between 1 mg to 6 mg per day, no additional benefit was observed above 3 mg per day, and higher doses were associated with more adverse events. Doses higher than 6 mg per day have not been studied.</p><p>Patients experiencing persistence somnolence may benefit from administering half the dose twice daily.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Maintenance Therapy</span></p><p>While it is unknown how long a patient with schizophrenia should remain on Risperidone, the effectiveness of Risperidone 2 mg per day to 8 mg per day at delaying relapse was demonstrated in a controlled trial in adult patients who had been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks and were then followed for a period of 1 to 2 years [see <span class="Bold">Clinical Studies (14.1)</span>]. Both adult and adolescent patients who respond acutely should generally be maintained on their effective dose beyond the acute episode. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Reinitiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued</span></p><p>Although there are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment, it is recommended that after an interval off risperidone, the initial titration schedule should be followed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Switching From Other Antipsychotics</span></p><p>There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching schizophrenic patients from other antipsychotics to risperidone, or treating patients with concomitant antipsychotics.</p><h3>Bipolar Mania</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Usual Dose</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The initial dose range is 2 mg to 3 mg per day. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 1 mg per day. The effective dose range is 1 mg to 6 mg per day, as studied in the short-term, placebo-controlled trials. In these trials, short-term (3 week) anti-manic efficacy was demonstrated in a flexible dosage range of 1 mg to 6 mg per day [see <span class="Bold">Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)</span>]. Risperidone doses higher than 6 mg per day were not studied.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatrics</span></p><p>The initial dose is 0.5 mg once daily, administered as a single-daily dose in the morning or evening. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 0.5 mg or 1 mg per day, as tolerated, to the recommended target dose of 1 mg to 2.5 mg per day. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in studies of pediatric patients with bipolar mania at doses between 0.5 mg and 6 mg per day, no additional benefit was observed above 2.5 mg per day, and higher doses were associated with more adverse events. Doses higher than 6 mg per day have not been studied.</p><p>Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from administering half the daily dose twice daily.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Maintenance Therapy</span></p><p>There is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to guide a clinician in the longer-term management of a patient who improves during treatment of an acute manic episode with risperidone. While it is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment beyond an acute response in mania is desirable, both for maintenance of the initial response and for prevention of new manic episodes, there are no systematically obtained data to support the use of risperidone in such longer-term treatment (i.e., beyond 3 weeks). The physician who elects to use risperidone for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient.</p><h3>Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder – Pediatrics (Children and Adolescents)</h3><p class="First">The dosage of risperidone should be individualized according to the response and tolerability of the patient. The total daily dose of risperidone can be administered once daily, or half the total daily dose can be administered twice daily.</p><p>For patients with body weight less than 20 kg, initiate dosing at 0.25 mg per day. For patients with body weight greater than or equal to 20 kg, initiate dosing at 0.5 mg per day. After a minimum of four days, the dose may be increased to the recommended dose of 0.5 mg per day for patients less than 20 kg and 1.0 mg per day for patients greater than or equal to 20 kg. Maintain this dose for a minimum of 14 days. In patients not achieving sufficient clinical response, the dose may be increased at intervals of 2 weeks or greater, in increments of 0.25 mg per day for patients less than 20 kg, or increments of 0.5 mg per day for patients greater than or equal to 20 kg. The effective dose range is 0.5 mg to 3 mg per day. No dosing data are available for children who weigh less than 15 kg.</p><p>Once sufficient clinical response has been achieved and maintained, consider gradually lowering the dose to achieve the optimal balance of efficacy and safety. The physician who elects to use risperidone for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient.</p><p>Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from a once-daily dose administered at bedtime or administering half the daily dose twice daily, or a reduction of the dose.</p><h3>Dosing in Patients with Severe Renal or Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">For patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr &lt; 30 mL/min) or hepatic impairment (10-15 points on Child Pugh System), the initial starting dose is 0.5 mg twice daily. The dose may be increased in increments of 0.5 mg or less, administered twice daily. For doses above 1.5 mg twice daily, increase in intervals of one week or greater [see <span class="Bold">Use in Specific Populations (8.6 and 8.7)</span>].</p><h3>Dose Adjustments for Specific Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">When Risperidone is co-administered with enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine), the dose of Risperidone should be increased up to double the patient's usual dose. It may be necessary to decrease the Risperidone dose when enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine are discontinued [see <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions (7.1)</span>]. Similar effect may be expected with coadministration of Risperidone with other enzyme inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital).</p><p>When fluoxetine or paroxetine is co-administered with Risperidone , the dose of Risperidone should be reduced. The Risperidone dose should not exceed 8 mg per day in adults when co-administered with these drugs. When initiating therapy, Risperidone should be titrated slowly. It may be necessary to increase the Risperidone dose when enzyme inhibitors such as fluoxetine or paroxetine are discontinued [see <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions (7.1)</span>].</p><h3>Administration of Risperidone Oral Solution</h3><p class="First">Risperidone Oral Solution can be administered directly from the calibrated pipette, or can be mixed with a beverage prior to administration. Risperidone Oral Solution is compatible in the following beverages: water, coffee, orange juice, and low-fat milk; it is NOT compatible with either cola or tea.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Risperidone is available as a 1 mg/mL oral solution.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Risperidone Oral Solution is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to either risperidone or paliperidone, or to any of the excipients in the Risperidone Oral Solution. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema, have been reported in patients treated with risperidone and in patients treated with paliperidone. Paliperidone is a metabolite of risperidone.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear.</p><p>In two of four placebo-controlled trials in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, a higher incidence of mortality was observed in patients treated with furosemide plus Risperidone when compared to patients treated with Risperidone alone or with placebo plus furosemide. No pathological mechanism has been identified to explain this finding, and no consistent pattern for cause of death was observed.</p><p>Risperidone is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis [see <span class="Bold">Boxed Warning</span>].</p><h3>Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</h3><p class="First">Cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age 85 years; range 73-97) in trials of risperidone in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. In placebo-controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with risperidone compared to patients treated with placebo. Risperidone is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. [See also <span class="Bold">Boxed Warnings</span> and <span class="Bold">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]</p><h3>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Antipsychotic drugs including Risperidone can cause a potentially fatal symptom complex referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure.</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases in which the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.</p><p>The management of NMS should include: (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.</p><p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.</p><h3>Tardive Dyskinesia</h3><p class="First">A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.</p><p>There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</p><p>Given these considerations, prescribe risperidone in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that: (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.</p><p>If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient treated with risperidone, consider drug discontinuation. However, some patients may require treatment with risperidone despite the presence of the syndrome.</p><h3>Metabolic Changes</h3><p class="First">Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus</span></p><p>Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including risperidone. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.</p><p>Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic, including risperidone, was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of risperidone.</p><p>Pooled data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies and four double-blind, placebo-controlled bipolar monotherapy studies are presented in Table 2.</p><p>In longer-term, controlled and uncontrolled studies, risperidone was associated with a mean change in glucose of +2.8 mg/dL at Week 24 (n=151) and +4.1 mg/dL at Week 48 (n=50).</p><p>Data from the placebo-controlled 3- to 6-week study in children and adolescents with schizophrenia (13 - 17 years of age), bipolar mania (10 - 17 years of age), or autistic disorder (5 to 17 years of age) are presented in Table 3.</p><p>In longer-term, uncontrolled, open-label extension pediatric studies, risperidone was associated with a mean change in fasting glucose of +5.2 mg/dL at Week 24 (n=119).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dyslipidemia</span></p><p>Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.</p><p>Pooled data from 7 placebo-controlled, 3- to 8- week, fixed- or flexible-dose studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar mania are presented in Table 4.</p><p>In longer-term, controlled and uncontrolled studies, risperidone was associated with a mean change in (a) non-fasting cholesterol of +4.4 mg/dL at Week 24 (n=231) and +5.5 mg/dL at Week 48 (n=86); and (b) non-fasting triglycerides of +19.9 mg/dL at Week 24 (n=52).</p><p>Pooled data from 3 placebo-controlled, 3- to 6-week, fixed-dose studies in children and adolescents with schizophrenia (13 - 17 years of age), bipolar mania (10 - 17 years of age), or autistic disorder (5 -17 years of age) are presented in Table 5.</p><p>In longer-term, uncontrolled, open-label extension pediatric studies, risperidone was associated with a mean change in (a) fasting cholesterol of +2.1 mg/dL at Week 24 (n=114); (b) fasting LDL of -0.2 mg/dL at Week 24 (n=103); (c) fasting HDL of +0.4 mg/dL at Week 24 (n=103); and (d) fasting triglycerides of +6.8 mg/dL at Week 24 (n=120).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Weight Gain</span></p><p>Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.</p><p>Data on mean changes in body weight and the proportion of subjects meeting a weight gain criterion of 7% or greater of body weight from 7 placebo-controlled, 3- to 8- week, fixed- or flexible-dose studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar mania are presented in Table 6.</p><p>In longer-term, controlled and uncontrolled studies, risperidone was associated with a mean change in weight of +4.3 kg at Week 24 (n=395) and +5.3 kg at Week 48 (n=203).</p><p>Data on mean changes in body weight and the proportion of subjects meeting the criterion of ≥7% gain in body weight from nine placebo-controlled, 3- to 8-week, fixed-dose studies in children and adolescents with schizophrenia (13 - 17 years of age), bipolar mania (10 -17 years of age), autistic disorder (5 -17 years of age), or other psychiatric disorders (5 -17 years of age) are presented in Table 7.</p><p>In longer-term, uncontrolled, open-label extension pediatric studies, risperidone was associated with a mean change in weight of +5.5 kg at Week 24 (n=748) and +8.0 kg at Week 48 (n=242).</p><p>In a long-term, open-label extension study in adolescent patients with schizophrenia, weight increase was reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 14% of patients. In 103 adolescent patients with schizophrenia, a mean increase of 9.0 kg was observed after 8 months of Risperidone treatment. The majority of that increase was observed within the first 6 months. The average percentiles at baseline and 8 months, respectively, were 56 and 72 for weight, 55 and 58 for height, and 51 and 71 for body mass index.</p><p>In long-term, open-label trials (studies in patients with autistic disorder or other psychiatric disorders), a mean increase of 7.5 kg after 12 months of Risperidone treatment was observed, which was higher than the expected normal weight gain (approximately 3 to 3.5 kg per year adjusted for age, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention normative data). The majority of that increase occurred within the first 6 months of exposure to Risperidone. The average percentiles at baseline and 12 months, respectively, were 49 and 60 for weight, 48 and 53 for height, and 50 and 62 for body mass index.</p><p>In one 3-week, placebo-controlled trial in children and adolescent patients with acute manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder, increases in body weight were higher in the Risperidone groups than the placebo group, but not dose related (1.90 kg in the Risperidone 0.5-2.5 mg group, 1.44 kg in the Risperidone 3-6 mg group, and 0.65 kg in the placebo group). A similar trend was observed in the mean change from baseline in body mass index.</p><p>When treating pediatric patients with Risperidone for any indication, weight gain should be assessed against that expected with normal growth.</p><h3>Hyperprolactinemia</h3><p class="First">As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D <span class="Sub">2</span> receptors, risperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Risperidone is associated with higher levels of prolactin elevation than other antipsychotic agents.</p><p>Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.</p><p>Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. An increase in pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see <span class="Bold">Non-Clinical Toxicology (13.1)</span>]. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.</p><h3>Orthostatic Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Risperidone may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably reflecting its alphaadrenergic antagonistic properties. Syncope was reported in 0.2% (6/2607) of risperidone-treated patients in Phase 2 and 3 studies in adults with schizophrenia. The risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to 2 mg total (either once daily or 1 mg twice daily) in normal adults and 0.5 mg twice daily in the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment [see <span class="Bold">Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4)</span>]. Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients for whom this is of concern. A dose reduction should be considered if hypotension occurs. Risperidone should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension, e.g., dehydration and hypovolemia. Clinically significant hypotension has been observed with concomitant use of risperidone and antihypertensive medication.</p><h3>Falls</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability have been reported with the use of antipsychotics, including Risperidone, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other fall-related injuries. For patients, particularly the elderly, with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, assess the risk of falls when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.</span></p><h3>Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis</h3><p class="First">Class Effect: In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including risperidone. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.</p><p>Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or a drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of risperidone should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.</p><p>Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/mm <span class="Sup">3</span>) should discontinue risperidone and have their WBC followed until recovery.</p><h3>Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment</h3><p class="First">Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse event associated with risperidone treatment, especially when ascertained by direct questioning of patients. This adverse event is dose-related, and in a study utilizing a checklist to detect adverse events, 41% of the high-dose patients (risperidone 16 mg/day) reported somnolence compared to 16% of placebo patients. Direct questioning is more sensitive for detecting adverse events than spontaneous reporting, by which 8% of risperidone 16 mg/day patients and 1% of placebo patients reported somnolence as an adverse event. Since risperidone has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that risperidone therapy does not affect them adversely.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">During premarketing testing in adult patients with schizophrenia, seizures occurred in 0.3% (9/2607) of risperidone-treated patients, two in association with hyponatremia. Risperidone should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures.</p><h3>Dysphagia</h3><p class="First">Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. Risperidone and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. [See also <span class="Bold">Boxed Warning</span> and <span class="Bold">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]</p><h3>Priapism</h3><p class="First">Priapism has been reported during postmarketing surveillance. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention.</p><h3>Body Temperature Regulation</h3><p class="First">Disruption of body temperature regulation has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Both hyperthermia and hypothermia have been reported in association with oral risperidone use. Caution is advised when prescribing for patients who will be exposed to temperature extremes.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul>

This dose produced plasma levels (AUC) of risperidone plus paliperidone which were about two thirds of those observed in humans at the MRHD.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether or not they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, a lower starting dose is recommended for an elderly patient, reflecting a decreased pharmacokinetic clearance in the elderly, as well as a greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see <span class="Bold">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span> and <span class="Bold">Dosage and Administration (2.4,</span> <span class="Bold">2.5)</span>]. While elderly patients exhibit a greater tendency to orthostatic hypotension, its risk in the elderly may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to 0.5 mg twice daily followed by careful titration [see <span class="Bold">Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</span>]. Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients for whom this is of concern.</p><p>This drug is substantially excreted by the kidneys, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see <span class="Bold">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with moderate to severe (Clcr 59 to 15 mL/min) renal disease, clearance of the sum of risperidone and its active metabolite decreased by 60%, compared to young healthy subjects. Risperidone doses should be reduced in patients with renal disease [see <span class="Bold">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span>].</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">While the pharmacokinetics of risperidone in subjects with liver disease were comparable to those in young healthy subjects, the mean free fraction of risperidone in plasma was increased by about 35% because of the diminished concentration of both albumin and α <span class="Sub">1</span>-acid glycoprotein. Risperidone doses should be reduced in patients with liver disease [see <span class="Bold">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span>].</p><h3>Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Lewy Body Dementia</h3><p class="First">Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies can experience increased sensitivity to Risperidone. Manifestations can include confusion, obtundation, postural instability with frequent falls, extrapyramidal symptoms, and clinical features consistent with neuroleptic malignant syndrome.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Risperidone is not a controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Risperidone has not been systematically studied in animals or humans for its potential for abuse. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of risperidone misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drug-seeking behavior).</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Risperidone has not been systematically studied in animals or humans for its potential for tolerance or physical dependence.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Human Experience</h3><p class="First">Premarketing experience included eight reports of acute risperidone overdosage with estimated doses ranging from 20 to 300 mg and no fatalities. In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, and extrapyramidal symptoms. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 240 mg, was associated with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, prolonged QT, and widened QRS. Another case, involving an estimated overdose of 36 mg, was associated with a seizure.</p><p>Postmarketing experience includes reports of acute risperidone overdosage, with estimated doses of up to 360 mg. In general, the most frequently reported signs and symptoms are those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness, sedation, tachycardia, hypotension, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Other adverse reactions reported since market introduction related to risperidone overdose include prolonged QT interval and convulsions. Torsade de pointes has been reported in association with combined overdose of risperidone and paroxetine.</p><h3>Management of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">For the most up to date information on the management of Risperidone overdosage, contact a certified poison control center (1-800-222-1222 or www.poison.org). Provide supportive care including close medical supervision and monitoring. Treatment should consist of general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug. Consider the possibility of multiple drug overdosage. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Use supportive and symptomatic measures. There is no specific antidote to Risperidone .</p><h2>Risperidone Oral Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Risperidone Oral Solution contains risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic belonging to the chemical class of benzisoxazole derivatives. The chemical designation is 3-[2-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)-1-piperidinyl]ethyl]-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one. Its molecular formula is C <span class="Sub">23</span>H <span class="Sub">27</span>FN <span class="Sub">4</span>O <span class="Sub">2</span> and its molecular weight is 410.49. The structural formula is:</p><p>Risperidone is a white or almost white powder. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in methylene chloride and soluble in methanol and 0.1 N HCl.</p><p>Risperidone is available as a 1 mg/mL oral solution. The inactive ingredients for this solution are benzoic acid, sodium hydroxide, sorbitol solution, purified water and tartaric acid.</p><h2>Risperidone Oral Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of risperidone, in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia could be mediated through a combination of dopamine Type 2 (D <span class="Sub">2</span>) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT <span class="Sub">2</span>) receptor antagonism. The clinical effect from Risperidone results from the combined concentrations of risperidone and its major metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone [see <span class="Bold">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. Antagonism at receptors other than D <span class="Sub">2</span> and 5HT <span class="Sub">2</span> [see <span class="Bold">Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)</span>] may explain some of the other effects of Risperidone.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Risperidone is a selective monoaminergic antagonist with high affinity (Ki of 0.12 to 7.3 nM) for the serotonin Type 2 (5HT <span class="Sub">2</span>), dopamine Type 2 (D <span class="Sub">2</span>), α <span class="Sub">1</span> and α <span class="Sub">2</span> adrenergic, and H <span class="Sub">1</span> histaminergic receptors. Risperidone acts as an antagonist at other receptors, but with lower potency. Risperidone has low to moderate affinity (Ki of 47 to 253 nM) for the serotonin 5HT <span class="Sub">1C</span>, 5HT <span class="Sub">1D</span>, and 5HT <span class="Sub">1A</span> receptors, weak affinity (Ki of 620 to 800 nM) for the dopamine D <span class="Sub">1</span> and haloperidol-sensitive sigma site, and no affinity (when tested at concentrations &gt;10 <span class="Sup">-5</span> M) for cholinergic muscarinic or β <span class="Sub">1</span> and β <span class="Sub">2</span> adrenergic receptors.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Risperidone is well absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of risperidone is 70% (CV=25%). The relative oral bioavailability of risperidone from a tablet is 94% (CV=10%) when compared to a solution.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic studies showed that Risperidone Oral Solution is bioequivalent to risperidone tablets.</p><p>Plasma concentrations of risperidone, its major metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone are dose proportional over the dosing range of 1 to 16 mg daily (0.5 to 8 mg twice daily). Following oral administration of solution, mean peak plasma concentrations of risperidone occurred at about 1 hour. Peak concentrations of 9-hydroxyrisperidone occurred at about 3 hours in extensive metabolizers, and 17 hours in poor metabolizers. Steady-state concentrations of risperidone are reached in 1 day in extensive metabolizers and would be expected to reach steady-state in about 5 days in poor metabolizers. Steady-state concentrations of 9-hydroxyrisperidone are reached in 5-6 days (measured in extensive metabolizers).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Food Effect</span></p><p>Food does not affect either the rate or extent of absorption of risperidone. Thus, risperidone can be given with or without meals.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Risperidone is rapidly distributed. The volume of distribution is 1-2 L/kg. In plasma, risperidone is bound to albumin and α <span class="Sub">1</span>-acid glycoprotein. The plasma protein binding of risperidone is 90%, and that of its major metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, is 77%. Neither risperidone nor 9-hydroxyrisperidone displaces each other from plasma binding sites. High therapeutic concentrations of sulfamethazine (100 mcg/mL), warfarin (10 mcg/mL), and carbamazepine (10 mcg/mL) caused only a slight increase in the free fraction of risperidone at 10 ng/mL and 9-hydroxyrisperidone at 50 ng/mL, changes of unknown clinical significance.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Risperidone is extensively metabolized in the liver. The main metabolic pathway is through hydroxylation of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone by the enzyme, CYP 2D6. A minor metabolic pathway is through <span class="Italics">N</span>-dealkylation. The main metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, has similar pharmacological activity as risperidone. Consequently, the clinical effect of the drug results from the combined concentrations of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone.</p><p>CYP 2D6, also called debrisoquin hydroxylase, is the enzyme responsible for metabolism of many neuroleptics, antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, and other drugs. CYP 2D6 is subject to genetic polymorphism (about 6%-8% of Caucasians, and a very low percentage of Asians, have little or no activity and are "poor metabolizers") and to inhibition by a variety of substrates and some non-substrates, notably quinidine. Extensive CYP 2D6 metabolizers convert risperidone rapidly into 9-hydroxyrisperidone, whereas poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers convert it much more slowly. Although extensive metabolizers have lower risperidone and higher 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations than poor metabolizers, the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone combined, after single and multiple doses, are similar in extensive and poor metabolizers.</p><p>Risperidone could be subject to two kinds of drug-drug interactions. First, inhibitors of CYP 2D6 interfere with conversion of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone [see <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions (7)</span>]. This occurs with quinidine, giving essentially all recipients a risperidone pharmacokinetic profile typical of poor metabolizers. The therapeutic benefits and adverse effects of risperidone in patients receiving quinidine have not been evaluated, but observations in a modest number (n≅70) of poor metabolizers given risperidone do not suggest important differences between poor and extensive metabolizers. Second, co-administration of known enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital) with risperidone may cause a decrease in the combined plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone [see <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions (7)</span>]. It would also be possible for risperidone to interfere with metabolism of other drugs metabolized by CYP 2D6. Relatively weak binding of risperidone to the enzyme suggests this is unlikely [see <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicate that risperidone is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP 2D6. Therefore, Risperidone is not expected to substantially inhibit the clearance of drugs that are metabolized by this enzymatic pathway. In drug interaction studies, Risperidone did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of donepezil and galantamine, which are metabolized by CYP 2D6.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies demonstrated that drugs metabolized by other CYP isozymes, including 1A1, 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4, are only weak inhibitors of risperidone metabolism.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>Risperidone and its metabolites are eliminated via the urine and, to a much lesser extent, via the feces. As illustrated by a mass balance study of a single 1 mg oral dose of 14C-risperidone administered as solution to three healthy male volunteers, total recovery of radioactivity at 1 week was 84%, including 70% in the urine and 14% in the feces.</p><p>The apparent half-life of risperidone was 3 hours (CV=30%) in extensive metabolizers and 20 hours (CV=40%) in poor metabolizers. The apparent half-life of 9-hydroxyrisperidone was about 21 hours (CV=20%) in extensive metabolizers and 30 hours (CV=25%) in poor metabolizers. The pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone combined, after single and multiple doses, were similar in extensive and poor metabolizers, with an overall mean elimination half-life of about 20 hours.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug-Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p>[See <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Renal and Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>[See <span class="Bold">Use in Specific Populations (8.6 and 8.7)</span>]</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Elderly</span></p><p>In healthy elderly subjects, renal clearance of both risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone was decreased, and elimination half-lives were prolonged compared to young healthy subjects.

Risperidone was administered in the diet at doses of 0.63 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg for 18 months to mice and for 25 months to rats. These doses are equivalent to approximately 2, 9, and 38 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) for schizophrenia (16 mg/day) on a mg/kg basis or 0.2, 0.75, and 3 times the MRHD (mice) or 0.4, 1.5, and 6 times the MRHD (rats) on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis. A maximum tolerated dose was not achieved in male mice. There were statistically significant increases in pituitary gland adenomas, endocrine pancreas adenomas, and mammary gland adenocarcinomas. The following table summarizes the multiples of the human dose on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> (mg/kg) basis at which these tumors occurred.</p><p>Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the risperidone carcinogenicity studies; however, measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that risperidone elevated serum prolactin levels 5-6 fold in mice and rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity studies. An increase in mammary, pituitary, and endocrine pancreas neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be prolactin-mediated. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown [see <span class="Bold">Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>No evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential for risperidone was found in the Ames gene mutation test, mouse lymphoma assay, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> rat hepatocyte DNA-repair assay, <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus test in mice, the sex-linked recessive lethal test in <span class="Italics">Drosophila</span>, or the chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes or Chinese hamster ovary cells.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Risperidone (0.16 to 5 mg/kg) was shown to impair mating, but not fertility, in Wistar rats in three reproductive studies (two Segment I and a multigenerational study) at doses 0.1 to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The effect appeared to be in females, since impaired mating behavior was not noted in the Segment I study in which males only were treated. In a subchronic study in Beagle dogs in which risperidone was administered orally at doses of 0.31 to 5 mg/kg, sperm motility and concentration were decreased at doses 0.6 to 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area basis. Dose-related decreases were also noted in serum testosterone at the same doses. Serum testosterone and sperm parameters partially recovered, but remained decreased after treatment was discontinued. No no-effect doses were noted in either rat or dog.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology</h3><p class="First">Juvenile dogs were treated for 40 weeks with oral risperidone doses of 0.31, 1.25, or 5 mg/kg/day. Decreased bone length and density were observed with a no-effect dose of 0.31 mg/kg/day. This dose produced plasma AUC levels of risperidone plus its active metabolite paliperidone (9-hydroxy-risperidone) which were similar to those in children and adolescents receiving the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 6 mg/day. In addition, a delay in sexual maturation was seen at all doses in both males and females. The above effects showed little or no reversibility in females after a 12 week drug-free recovery period.</p><p>In a study in which juvenile rats were treated with oral risperidone from days 12 to 50 of age, a reversible impairment of performance in a test of learning and memory was observed in females only with a no-effect dose of 0.63 mg/kg/day. This dose produced plasma AUC levels of risperidone plus paliperidone about half those observed in humans at the MRHD. No other consistent effects on neurobehavioral or reproductive development were seen up to the highest testable dose of 1.25 mg/kg/day. This dose produced plasma AUC levels of risperidone plus paliperidone which were about two thirds of those observed in humans at the MRHD.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Schizophrenia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Short-Term Efficacy</span></p><p>The efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia was established in four short-term (4- to 8-week) controlled trials of psychotic inpatients who met DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia.</p><p>Several instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in these studies, among them the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), a multi-item inventory of general psychopathology traditionally used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in schizophrenia. The BPRS psychosis cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset for assessing actively psychotic schizophrenic patients. A second traditional assessment, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient. In addition, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Scale for Assessing Negative Symptoms (SANS) were employed.</p><p>The results of the trials follow:</p><ul>
<li>In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (n=160) involving titration of risperidone in doses up to 10 mg/day (twice-daily schedule), risperidone was generally superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, on the BPRS psychosis cluster, and marginally superior to placebo on the SANS.</li>
<li>In an 8-week, placebo-controlled trial (n=513) involving 4 fixed doses of risperidone (2 mg/day, 6 mg/day, 10 mg/day, and 16 mg/day, on a twice-daily schedule), all 4 risperidone groups were generally superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, BPRS psychosis cluster, and CGI severity score; the 3 highest risperidone dose groups were generally superior to placebo on the PANSS negative subscale. The most consistently positive responses on all measures were seen for the 6 mg dose group, and there was no suggestion of increased benefit from larger doses.</li>
<li>In an 8-week, dose comparison trial (n=1356) involving 5 fixed doses of risperidone (1 mg/day, 4 mg/day, 8 mg/day, 12 mg/day, and 16 mg/day, on a twice-daily schedule), the four highest risperidone dose groups were generally superior to the 1 mg risperidone dose group on BPRS total score, BPRS psychosis cluster, and CGI severity score. None of the dose groups were superior to the 1 mg group on the PANSS negative subscale. The most consistently positive responses were seen for the 4 mg dose group.</li>
<li>In a 4-week, placebo-controlled dose comparison trial (n=246) involving 2 fixed doses of risperidone (4 and 8 mg/day on a once-daily schedule), both risperidone dose groups were generally superior to placebo on several PANSS measures, including a response measure (&gt;20% reduction in PANSS total score), PANSS total score, and the BPRS psychosis cluster (derived from PANSS). The results were generally stronger for the 8 mg than for the 4 mg dose group.</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Long-Term Efficacy</span></p><p>In a longer-term trial, 365 adult outpatients predominantly meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and who had been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks on an antipsychotic medication were randomized to risperidone (2-8 mg/day) or to an active comparator, for 1 to 2 years of observation for relapse. Patients receiving risperidone experienced a significantly longer time to relapse over this time period compared to those receiving the active comparator.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatrics</span></p><p>The efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents aged 13 - 17 years was demonstrated in two short-term (6 and 8 weeks), double-blind controlled trials. All patients met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and were experiencing an acute episode at time of enrollment. In the first trial (study #1), patients were randomized into one of three treatment groups: risperidone 1 - 3 mg/day (n = 55, mean modal dose = 2.6 mg), risperidone 4 - 6 mg/day (n = 51, mean modal dose = 5.3 mg), or placebo (n = 54). In the second trial (study #2), patients were randomized to either risperidone 0.15 - 0.6 mg/day (n = 132, mean modal dose = 0.5 mg) or risperidone 1.5 - 6 mg/day (n = 125, mean modal dose = 4 mg). In all cases, study medication was initiated at 0.5 mg/day (with the exception of the 0.15 - 0.6 mg/day group in study #2, where the initial dose was 0.05 mg/day) and titrated to the target dosage range by approximately Day 7. Subsequently, dosage was increased to the maximum tolerated dose within the target dose range by Day 14. The primary efficacy variable in all studies was the mean change from baseline in total PANSS score.</p><p>Results of the studies demonstrated efficacy of risperidone in all dose groups from 1 - 6 mg/day compared to placebo, as measured by significant reduction of total PANSS score. The efficacy on the primary parameter in the 1 - 3 mg/day group was comparable to the 4 - 6 mg/day group in study #1, and similar to the efficacy demonstrated in the 1.5 - 6 mg/day group in study #2. In study #2, the efficacy in the 1.5 - 6 mg/day group in study #2. In study #2, the efficacy in the 1.5 - 6 mg/day group was statistically significantly greater than that in the 0.15 - 0.6 mg/day group.

These trials included patients with or without psychotic features.</p><p>The primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in these trials was the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), an 11-item clinician-rated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology (irritability, disruptive/aggressive behavior, sleep, elevated mood, speech, increased activity, sexual interest, language/thought disorder, thought content, appearance, and insight) in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). The primary outcome in these trials was change from baseline in the YMRS total score. The results of the trials follow:</p><ul>
<li>In one 3-week placebo-controlled trial (n=246), limited to patients with manic episodes, which involved a dose range of risperidone 1-6 mg/day, once daily, starting at 3 mg/day (mean modal dose was 4.1 mg/day), risperidone was superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score.</li>
<li>In another 3-week placebo-controlled trial (n=286), which involved a dose range of 1-6 mg/day, once daily, starting at 3 mg/day (mean modal dose was 5.6 mg/day), risperidone was superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score.</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatrics</span></p><p>The efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of mania in children or adolescents with Bipolar I disorder was demonstrated in a 3-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial including patients ranging in ages from 10 to 17 years who were experiencing a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder. Patients were randomized into one of three treatment groups: risperidone 0.5 to 2.5 mg/day (n = 50, mean modal dose = 1.9 mg), risperidone 3 to 6 mg/day (n = 61, mean modal dose = 4.7 mg), or placebo (n = 58). In all cases, study medication was initiated at 0.5 mg/day and titrated to the target dosage range by Day 7, with further increases in dosage to the maximum tolerated dose within the targeted dose range by Day 10. The primary rating instrument used for assessing efficacy in this study was the mean change from baseline in the total YMRS score.</p><p>Results of this study demonstrated efficacy of risperidone in both dose groups compared with placebo, as measured by significant reduction of total YMRS score. The efficacy on the primary parameter in the 3 - 6 mg/day dose group was comparable to the 0.5 - 2.5 mg/day dose group. Doses higher than 2.5 mg/day did not reveal any trend towards greater efficacy.</p><h3>Bipolar Mania – Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of risperidone with concomitant lithium or valproate in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes was established in one controlled trial in adult patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder. This trial included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course.</p><ul>
<li>In this 3-week placebo-controlled combination trial, 148 in- or outpatients on lithium or valproate therapy with inadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms were randomized to receive risperidone, placebo, or an active comparator, in combination with their original therapy. Risperidone, in a dose range of 1-6 mg/day, once daily, starting at 2 mg/day (mean modal dose of 3.8 mg/day), combined with lithium or valproate (in a therapeutic range of 0.6 mEq/L to 1.4 mEq/L or 50 mcg/mL to 120 mcg/mL, respectively) was superior to lithium or valproate alone in the reduction of YMRS total score.</li>
<li>In a second 3-week placebo-controlled combination trial, 142 in- or outpatients on lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine therapy with inadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms were randomized to receive risperidone or placebo, in combination with their original therapy. Risperidone, in a dose range of 1-6 mg/day, once daily, starting at 2 mg/day (mean modal dose of 3.7 mg/day), combined with lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine (in therapeutic ranges of 0.6 mEq/L to 1.4 mEq/L for lithium, 50 mcg/mL to 125 mcg/mL for valproate, or 4-12 mcg/mL for carbamazepine, respectively) was not superior to lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine alone in the reduction of YMRS total score. A possible explanation for the failure of this trial was induction of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone clearance by carbamazepine, leading to subtherapeutic levels of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone.</li>
</ul><h3>Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Short-Term Efficacy</span></p><p>The efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder was established in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents (aged 5 to 16 years) who met the DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder. Over 90% of these subjects were under 12 years of age and most weighed over 20 kg (16 to 104.3 kg).</p><p>Efficacy was evaluated using two assessment scales: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Clinical Global Impression - Change (CGI-C) scale. The primary outcome measure in both trials was the change from baseline to endpoint in the Irritability subscale of the ABC (ABC-I). The ABC-I subscale measured the emotional and behavioral symptoms of autism, including aggression towards others, deliberate self-injuriousness, temper tantrums, and quickly changing moods. The CGI-C rating at endpoint was a co-primary outcome measure in one of the studies.</p><p>The results of these trials are as follows:</p><p>(1) In one of the 8-week, placebo-controlled trials, children and adolescents with autistic disorder (n=101), aged 5 to 16 years, received twice daily doses of placebo or risperidone 0.5 - 3.5 mg/day on a weight-adjusted basis. Risperidone starting at 0.25 mg/day or 0.5 mg/day depending on baseline weight (&lt; 20 kg and ≥ 20 kg, respectively) and titrated to clinical response (mean modal dose of 1.9 mg/day, equivalent to 0.06 mg/kg/day), significantly improved scores on the ABC-I subscale and on the CGI-C scale compared with placebo.</p><p>(2) In the other 8-week, placebo-controlled trial in children with autistic disorder (n=55), aged 5 to 12 years, risperidone 0.02 to 0.06 mg/kg/day given once or twice daily, starting at 0.01 mg/kg/day and titrated to clinical response (mean modal dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day, equivalent to 1.4 mg/day), significantly improved scores on the ABC-I subscale compared with placebo.</p><p>A third trial was a 6-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a lower than recommended dose of risperidone in subjects (N=96) 5 to 17 years of age with autistic disorder (defined by DSM-IV criteria) and associated irritability and related behavioral symptoms. Approximately 77% of patients were younger than 12 years of age (mean age = 9), and 88% were male. Most patients (73%) weighed less than 45 kg (mean weight = 40 kg). Approximately 90% of patients were antipsychotic-naïve before entering the study.</p><p>There were two weight-based, fixed doses of risperidone (high-dose and low-dose). The high dose was 1.25 mg per day for patients weighing 20 to &lt; 45 kg, and it was 1.75 mg per day for patients weighing ≥ 45 kg. The low dose was 0.125 mg per day for patients weighing 20 to &lt; 45 kg, and it was 0.175 mg per day for patients weighing ≥ 45 kg. The dose was administered once daily in the morning, or in the evening if sedation occurred.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist – Irritability subscale (ABC-I) score from baseline to the end of Week 6. The study demonstrated the efficacy of high-dose risperidone, as measured by the mean change in ABC-I score. It did not demonstrate efficacy for low-dose risperidone. The mean baseline ABC-I scores were 29 in the placebo group (n = 35), 27 in the risperidone low-dose group (n = 30), and 28 in the risperidone high-dose group (n = 31). The mean changes in ABC-I scores were -3.5, -7.4, and -12.4 in the placebo, low-dose, and high-dose group respectively. The results in the high-dose group were statistically significant (p&lt; 0.001) but not in the low-dose group (p=0.164).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Long-Term Efficacy</span></p><p>Following completion of the first 8-week double-blind study, 63 patients entered an open-label study extension where they were treated with risperidone for 4 or 6 months (depending on whether they received risperidone or placebo in the double-blind study). During this open-label treatment period, patients were maintained on a mean modal dose of risperidone of 1.8 to 2.1 mg/day (equivalent to 0.05 to 0.07 mg/kg/day).</p><p>Patients who maintained their positive response to risperidone (response was defined as ≥ 25% improvement on the ABC-I subscale and a CGI-C rating of 'much improved' or 'very much improved') during the 4 - 6 month open-label treatment phase for about 140 days, on average, were randomized to receive risperidone or placebo during an 8-week, double-blind withdrawal study (n=39 of the 63 patients). A pre-planned interim analysis of data from patients who completed the withdrawal study (n=32), undertaken by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate in the risperidone group compared with the placebo group. Based on the interim analysis results, the study was terminated due to demonstration of a statistically significant effect on relapse prevention. Relapse was defined as ≥25% worsening on the most recent assessment of the ABC-I subscale (in relation to baseline of the randomized withdrawal phase).</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First">Risperidone Oral Solution USP, 1 mg/mL is a colorless to clear solution supplied in bottles of 30 mL.</p><h3>Storage and Handling</h3><p class="First">Risperidone Oral Solution should be stored at controlled room temperature 15°- 25°C (59°-77°F).
