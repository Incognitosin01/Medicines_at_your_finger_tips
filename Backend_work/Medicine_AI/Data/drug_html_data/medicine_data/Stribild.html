Cobicistat reduces the action of enzymes in your liver that break down certain antiviral medicines. This allows the antiviral medicines to be used more safely and effectively at lower doses.</p><p>Elvitegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir are antiviral medicines that prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from multiplying in your body. HIV can cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</p><p>Stribild is a combination medicine used to treat HIV in adults and children who are at least 12 years old and who weigh at least 55 pounds (25 kilograms).</p><p>Stribild is not a cure for HIV or AIDS.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Stribild can harm your liver.
