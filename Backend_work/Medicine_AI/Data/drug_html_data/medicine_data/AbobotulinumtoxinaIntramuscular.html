These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults, particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

Abobotulinumtoxina is also used cosmetically to improve the appearance of deep facial lines or wrinkles between the eyebrows (glabellar lines). It is also used to treat upper and lower limb spasms.</p><p>AbobotulinumtoxinA is a botulinum toxin A product. It works on the nervous system to relax the muscles.</p><p>Abobotulinumtoxina is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using abobotulinumtoxina</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For abobotulinumtoxina, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to abobotulinumtoxina or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of abobotulinumtoxinA in children with <i>cervical dystonia</i>, and in children younger than 2 years of age with <i>lower limb spasms or upper limb spasms, including spasms caused by cerebral palsy</i>. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p>Use of abobotulinumtoxinA to treat <i>glabellar lines</i> is not recommended in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of abobotulinumtoxinA in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of abobotulinumtoxina than younger adults and are more likely to have falls, weakness, or side effects related to the eyes, which may require caution in patients receiving abobotulinumtoxinA for lower limb spasticity and glabellar lines.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding.

In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of abobotulinumtoxina.
