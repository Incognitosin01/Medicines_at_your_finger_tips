Crush thirty 1 mg tablets in a mortar and reduce to a fine powder. Prepare diluent by mixing 30 mL of Ora-Plus with 30 mL of either Ora-Sweet or Ora-Sweet SF and stir vigorously. Add 30 mL of diluent (via geometric dilution) to powder until smooth suspension is obtained. Transfer suspension to 60 mL amber bottle. Rinse contents of mortar into bottle with sufficient quantity of remaining diluent to obtain 60 mL (final volume). Label “shake well”. Stable at room temperature for 90 days. Due to bitter aftertaste, chocolate syrup may be administered prior to or mixed (1:1 v/v) with suspension immediately before administration (Cober 2011).</p><p>A 0.5 mg/mL oral solution can be made from tablets. Crush fifty 1 mg tablets in a mortar and reduce to a fine powder. Add enough distilled water to make about 90 mL, mix well. Transfer to a bottle, rinse mortar with water, and add a quantity of water sufficient to make 100 mL. Label “shake well” and “protect from light”. Stable at room temperature for 25 days (Gupta 2001).</p><p><b>0.1 mg/mL Oral Solution</b></p><p>A 0.1 mg/mL oral solution may be made using glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg/mL injection without preservatives.

Constipation is a common dose-limiting adverse event. Intestinal pseudo-obstruction can result in abdominal distention, pain, nausea, or vomiting; discontinue if these symptoms develop or worsen during treatment.</p><p>• Heat prostration: May occur in the presence of fever, increased environmental temperature, and/or during physical exercise, particularly in children and the elderly; use caution in hot weather and/or exercise. Avoid exertion and high environmental temperature after administration.</p><p>• Mechanical obstruction (incomplete): Diarrhea may be an early sign of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with an ileostomy or colostomy; avoid use in these patients. Discontinue treatment if incomplete mechanical intestinal obstruction is suspected or if diarrhea occurs.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, hypertension, or tachycardia; evaluate tachycardia prior to administration.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; consider dosage reduction.</p><p>• Hiatal hernia: Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia with reflux esophagitis; consider dosage reduction.</p><p>• Hyperthyroidism: Use with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism.</p><p>• Neuropathy: Use with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy; consider dosage reduction.</p><p>• Prostatic hyperplasia/bladder neck obstruction: May worsen the symptoms (eg, urinary retention) of prostatic hyperplasia and/or bladder neck obstruction; use with caution; consider dosage reduction in patients with prostatic hypertrophy.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; elimination is severely impaired in renal failure; dosage adjustment may be necessary.</p><p>• Ulcerative colitis: Use with caution in patients with ulcerative colitis; large doses may suppress intestinal motility; consider dosage reduction; may precipitate/exacerbate an ileus or toxic megacolon. Use is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Elderly: Use with caution in the elderly; increased risk for anticholinergic effects, confusion, and hallucinations; consider dosage reduction.</p><p>• Pediatric: Infants, patients with Down syndrome, and pediatric patients with spastic paralysis or brain damage may experience an increased response to anticholinergics, increasing the potential for adverse events. A paradoxical reaction characterized by hyperexcitability may occur in pediatric patients taking large doses. Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effects of anticholinergics.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension and cardiovascular collapse (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p>• Glyrx-PR: Sensitivity of the eyes to light may occur. Protect eyes from light after administration.</p><p>• Propylene glycol: Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; large amounts are potentially toxic and have been associated hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP 1997; Zar 2007).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Heart rate; anticholinergic effects; bowel sounds; bowel movements; effects on drooling</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
