Insulin isophane is an intermediate-acting insulin that starts to work within 2 to 4 hours after injection, peaks in 4 to 12 hours, and keeps working for 12 to 18 hours.</p><p>Insulin isophane is used to improve blood sugar control in adults and children with diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Insulin isophane may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use  insulin isophane if you are having an episode of low blood sugar.</p><p>Never share an injection pen or syringe with another person, even if the needle has been changed.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use insulin isophane if you are allergic to it, or if you are having an episode of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).</p><p>Do not give insulin isophane to a child without a doctor's advice.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
