</ul><h2>Rejuvesol Description</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Rejuvesol <span class="Sup">®</span></span> Red Blood Cell Processing Solution ( <span class="Italics">Rejuvesol <span class="Sup">®</span></span> Solution) is a sterile, non-pyrogenic solution of sodium pyruvate, inosine, adenine, dibasic sodium phosphate, and monobasic sodium phosphate in water for injection intended only for use in the extracorporeal rejuvenation of a unit of red blood cell concentrate (RBC). Each 50 mL of <span class="Italics">Rejuvesol <span class="Sup">®</span></span> Solution contains sodium pyruvate 0.550 g, inosine 1.34 g, adenine 0.034 g, dibasic sodium phosphate (heptahydrate) 0.730 g, and monobasic sodium phosphate (monohydrate) 0.311 g, in water for injection, pH 6.7-7.4.</p><h2>Rejuvesol - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">A gradual depletion of red blood cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) occurs with storage of RBC at 1-6 °C. <span class="Sup">1</span> The level of 2,3-DPG in RBC stored for greater than 14 days is less than 10% of normal <span class="Sup">1,2,12,17,18</span>. Rejuvenation of RBC with <span class="Italics">Rejuvesol <span class="Sup">®</span></span> Solution increases the levels of ATP and 2,3-DPG. <span class="Sup">1-5,8,13,17-22,24, 25</span></p><p>An in vitro loss of red blood cells occurs with the preservation and processing of RBC. Thus, the effectiveness of a transfusion is influenced by both the total number of red blood cells transfused and the number of those cells which remain in circulation. Therefore, the "dose" of a transfusion is defined as the percentage of pre-transfusion recovered red blood cells multiplied by the 24 hour post-transfusion survival value.</p><p>Rejuvenation is accomplished by incubating the contents of one 50 mL vial of <span class="Italics">Rejuvesol <span class="Sup">®</span></span> Solution with one unit of RBC (prepared from up to 550 mL of whole blood) for sixty (60) minutes at 37 °C. Citra recommends that the entire 50 mL of <span class="Italics">Rejuvesol <span class="Sup">®</span></span> Solution be added to a "smaller than normal" RBC as long as the prerejuvenation net packed cell weight is greater than 110 grams. <span class="Sup">1,9</span></p><h2>INDICATION AND USAGE</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Rejuvesol <span class="Sup">®</span></span> Solution is intended only to be used as an in vitro processing solution for the rejuvenation of a unit of RBC. RBC may be rejuvenated after storage in CPD (non-leukocyte reduced), CPDA-1, (non-leukocyte reduced), CPD/ADSOL <span class="Sup">®</span> (CPD/AS-1 leukocyte reduced), or CP2D/Nutricel <span class="Sup">®</span> (CP2D/AS-3, leukocyte reduced). The final concentration of ATP and 2,3-DPG achieved after rejuvenation will vary depending on the number of days of liquid storage at 1-6 °C prior to rejuvenation. <span class="Bold">NOTE:</span> For simplicity, RBC stored in CPD (non-leukocyte reduced), CPDA-1 (non-leukocyte reduced), CPD/ADSOL <span class="Sup">®</span> (CPD/AS-1 leukocyte reduced), CP2D/Nutricel <span class="Sup">®</span> (CP2D/AS-3, leukocyte reduced) are referred to hereafter as CPD, CPDA-1, CPD/AS-1, and CP2D/AS-3, respectively. Citra Labs, LLC, recommends that rejuvenation of RBC be performed after 14 days or longer of liquid storage. RBC (CPD, CPDA-1, CPD/AS-1, and CP2D/AS-3) rejuvenated before 6 days of storage may achieve 2,3-DPG levels in excess of 2 times normal and ATP levels in excess of 1.5 times normal <span class="Sup">5,6</span> (See Warning and Contraindications).</p><h3>Rejuvenation of CPD or CPDA-1 RBC for Immediate use or for Cryopreservation</h3><p class="First">RBC which have been collected and stored in CPD or CPDA-1 anticoagulant may be rejuvenated up to three days after the expiration date of the RBC, as long as storage at 1-6 °C is not interrupted. <span class="Sup">3,4</span> After rejuvenation, RBC (CPD and CPDA-1) must be either washed and stored at 1-6 °C for up to 24 hours prior to transfusion or glycerolized and frozen at –80 °C (below –65 °C). Red Blood Cells Frozen Rejuvenated which were collected and stored in CPD or CPDA-1 may be stored frozen up to 10 years. <span class="Sup">10</span></p><p>When RBC are rejuvenated after maximum liquid storage, i.e., CPD RBC at 24 days or CPDA-1 RBC at 38 days, the concentrations of 2,3-DPG and ATP increase typically to above normal. <span class="Sup">1,3-5,6</span></p><p><span class="Bold">CAUTION:</span> RBC collected in CPD or CPDA-1 cannot be leukocyte reduced prior to rejuvenation.</p><h3>Rejuvenation of CPD/AS-1 RBC or CP2D/AS-3</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Rejuvesol <span class="Sup">®</span></span> Solution has not been approved for the rejuvenation of RBC stored in any additive systems other than AS-1 or AS-3. RBC stored in CPD/AS-1 or CP2D/AS-3 at 1-6 °C may be rejuvenated up to, but not exceeding, 42 days of storage as long as storage at 1-6 °C is not interrupted. Rejuvenated CPD/AS-1 RBC must be either washed and stored at 1-6 °C for up to 24 hours prior to transfusion or glycerolized and frozen at –80 °C (below –65 °C). Red Blood Cells Frozen Rejuvenated which were collected and stored in CPD/AS-1 may be stored for up to 3 years. Rejuvenated CP2D/AS-3 RBC must be washed and stored at 1-6 °C for up to 24 hours prior to transfusion. Unlike rejuvenated CPD, CPDA-1, CPD/AS-1 RBC, and CP2D/AS-3, rejuvenated RBC collected and stored in any other anticoagulant/additive solution combination have not been approved to be immediately washed and transfused or for cryopreservation.</p><p class="First">When CPD/AS-1 RBC are rejuvenated at 42 days of liquid storage, frozen, deglycerolized, and stored for 24 hours, the concentration of 2,3-DPG and ATP increases to above normal. In a limited study, the average 24 hour post-transfusion survival value of these cells was statistically higher than the reported <span class="Sup">12</span> survival value of CPD/AS-1 red blood cell concentrates which are stored for 42 days prior to transfusion. The "dose" may be equivalent for a CPD/AS-1 RBC whether the unit is stored for 42 days prior to transfusion or stored for 42 days, rejuvenated, frozen, deglycerolized, and stored for 24 hours prior to transfusion. Unlike rejuvenated CPD/AS-1 RBC, rejuvenated RBC (CP2D/AS-3) has not been approved for cryopreservation.</p><p class="First">When CPD/AS-1 RBC are rejuvenated at 42 days of liquid storage, washed, and stored for 24 hours, the concentration of ATP increases to day 0 values. For 2,3-DPG rejuvenation of RBCs stored in CPD/AS-1 for 42 days, the range of 2,3 DPG relative to day 0 value was 46%-172% with a mean of 98% ± 29%. For 66% of the RBC units (44/67, 33/33 in Site A and 11/34 in Site B) the concentration of 2,3-DPG reached at least 80% of the day 0 value.</p><p>When CP2D/AS-3 RBC are rejuvenated at 42 days of liquid storage, washed, and stored for 24 hours, the concentration of ATP increases to day 0 values. For 2,3-DPG rejuvenation of RBCs stored in CPD/AS-1 for 42 days, the range of 2,3 DPG relative to day 0 value was 48%-150% with a mean of 96% ± 23%. For 76% of the RBC units (52/68, 30/35 in Site A and 22/33 in Site B) the concentration of 2,3-DPG reached at least 80% of the day 0 value.</p><h2>WARNING AND CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Rejuvesol <span class="Sup">®</span></span> Solution is intended only for the extracorporeal rejuvenation of a RBC. It should never be directly administered to Humans.</p><p><span class="Italics">Rejuvesol <span class="Sup">®</span></span> Solution must not be added to whole blood because the additional plasma may reduce the effectiveness of the rejuvenation process. Immediately after rejuvenation, RBC must either be washed via an approved protocol prior to transfusion or glycerolized and frozen. RBC which have been rejuvenated, glycerolized, and frozen must be deglycerolized via an approved protocol prior to transfusion.</p><p>RBC rejuvenated before 6 days of storage may achieve 2,3-DPG levels in excess of 2 times normal and ATP levels in excess of 1.5 times normal. <span class="Sup">5,6</span> In patients with reduced arterial blood p0 <span class="Sub">2</span> of less than 40 torr, the use of RBC rejuvenated before 6 days of storage are contraindicated because their high 2,3-DPG levels and low oxygen affinity may impair proper oxygenation of the red blood cells in the lung. <span class="Sup">7</span></p><p>Rejuvenated RBC are further processed prior to transfusion to remove the un-used portion of <span class="Italics">Rejuvesol <span class="Sup">®</span></span> Solution, by-products of the rejuvenation process, and any other potential storage-related impurities in <span class="Italics">Rejuvesol <span class="Sup">®</span></span> Solution. Based on the concentration of the residual inosine in rejuvenated RBC that are either washed or deglycerolized, the average washout of inosine was calculated to be &gt; 97.4%. A literature search for potential toxicity associated with the ingredients that comprise <span class="Italics">Rejuvesol <span class="Sup">®</span></span> Solution, including potential metabolites, was conducted. <span class="Sup">23</span> This report concludes that no theoretical contraindications would be associated with the transfusion of a single unit of <span class="Bold">unwashed</span>, rejuvenated RBC that would contain amounts of pyruvate, inosine, adenine, phosphate, hypoxanthine, uric acid, and lactate that exceed reference values (excluding lactate) as these substances are naturally metabolized and/or are excreted. <span class="Sup">23</span></p><p>The maximum number of properly processed rejuvenated RBC that can be transfused to a single recipient over their entire lifetime has not been determined.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><ul>
<li>Aseptic technique must be maintained at all times.</li>
<li>Do not use unless solution is clear/colorless and seal is intact. Product that exhibits a slight yellow color should not be used. Product instability has been observed after continuous exposure at high temperature (after 6 months at 40 °C and after 9 months at &gt;30 °C).</li>
<li>This product contains no bacteriostatic or antimicrobial agents and is intended for single use only.</li>
<li>Rx Only - Federal (USA) law prohibits dispensing without prescription.</li>
</ul><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First">It is recommended that the product be stored at 15 - 25 °C (59 - 77 °F). Protect from freezing. Exposure to temperatures near or below freezing may produce a white precipitate in the solution; this precipitate will dissolve upon brief incubation at room temperature. Alternatively, the product may be warmed at 37 °C for up to one hour in a dry air incubator to dissolve the precipitate.</p><h2>How is Rejuvesol Supplied</h2><p class="First">PN 7012: 50 mL vial; 12 vials per case</p><h2>DIRECTIONS FOR REJUVENATION OF CPD, CPDA-1, CPD/AS-1, OR CP2D/AS-3 RBC PRIOR TO IMMEDIATE USE 3,11,25</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NOTE:</span> REJUVENATED RBC STORED IN ANY OTHER ANTICOAGULANT/ADDITIVE SOLUTION COMBINATION HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED TO BE IMMEDIATELY WASHED AND TRANSFUSED.</p><h3>MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT</h3><p class="First">(As Suggested or Equivalent)</p><h3>PROCEDURE</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NOTE:</span> The timing of incubation is measured from the time the red blood cell/ <span class="Italics">Rejuvesol <span class="Sup">®</span></span> Solution mixture is introduced into the water bath.
