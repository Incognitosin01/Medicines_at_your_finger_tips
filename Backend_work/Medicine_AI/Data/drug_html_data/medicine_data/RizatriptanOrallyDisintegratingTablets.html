</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Rizatriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets</h2><p class="First">Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating Tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years old.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response for the first migraine attack treated with rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets, USP, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets, USP are administered to treat any subsequent attacks.</li>
<li>Rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets are not indicated for use in the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine <span class="Italics">[see  Contraindications (4)]</span> .</li>
<li>Rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks.</li>
<li>Safety and effectiveness of Rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets have not been established for cluster headache.</li>
</ul><h2>Rizatriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosing Information in Adults</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dose of rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets is either 5 mg or 10 mg for the acute treatment of migraines in adults. The 10-mg dose may provide a greater effect than the 5-mg dose, but may have a greater risk of adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Redosing in Adults</span></p><p>Although the effectiveness of a second dose or subsequent doses has not been established in placebo-controlled trials, if the migraine headache returns, a second dose may be administered 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg in any 24-hour period. The safety of treating, on average, more than four headaches in a 30-day period has not been established.</p><h3>Dosing Information in Pediatric Patients (Age 6 to 17 Years)</h3><p class="First">Dosing in pediatric patients is based on the patient's body weight. The recommended dose of rizatriptan benzoate is 5 mg in patients weighing less than 40 kg (88 lb), and 10 mg in patients weighing 40 kg (88 lb) or more.</p><p>The efficacy and safety of treatment with more than one dose of rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets, USP within 24 hours in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age have not been established.</p><h3>Administration of Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating Tablets USP</h3><p class="First">For rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets, USP, administration with liquid is not necessary. Orally disintegrating tablets are packaged in a blister within an outer carton and patients should not remove the blister from the outer carton until just prior to dosing. The blister pack should then be peeled open with dry hands and the orally disintegrating tablet placed on the tongue, where it will dissolve and be swallowed with the saliva.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustment for Patients on Propranolol</h3><p class="First">Adult Patients</p><p>In adult patients taking propranolol, only the 5 mg dose of Rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets, USP are recommended, up to a maximum of 3 doses in any 24-hour period (15 mg) <span class="Italics">[see  Drug Interactions (7.1)and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>Pediatric Patients</p><p>For pediatric patients weighing ≥40 kg (88 lb), taking propranolol, only a single 5 mg dose of rizatriptan benzoate tablets, USP is recommended (maximum dose of 5 mg in a 24-hour period). Rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets, should not be prescribed to propranolol-treated pediatric patients who weigh less than 40 kg (88 lb) <span class="Italics">[see  Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating Tablets</span></p><p>5 mg orally disintegrating tablets are white to off white, round tablets debossed with '5' on one side.</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Rizatriptan Benzoate is contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Ischemic coronary artery disease (angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, or documented silent ischemia), or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease <span class="Italics">[see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> .</li>
<li>Coronary artery vasospasm including Prinzmetal's angina <span class="Italics">[see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> .</li>

<li>Hypersensitivity to rizatriptan benzoate or any of the excipients (angioedema and anaphylaxis seen) <span class="Italics">[see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span> .</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina</h3><p class="First">Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating Tablets should not be given to patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of Rizatriptan Benzoate. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). 5-HT <span class="Sub">1</span> agonists including Rizatriptan Benzoate may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.</p><p>Triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving Rizatriptan Benzoate. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, Rizatriptan Benzoate should not be administered <span class="Italics">[see  Contraindications (4)]</span> . For patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consideration should be given to administration of the first Rizatriptan benzoate dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following Rizatriptan benzoate administration. Periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered in intermittent long-term users of Rizatriptan benzoate who have cardiovascular risk factors.</p><h3>Arrhythmias</h3><p class="First">Life threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT <span class="Sub">1</span> agonists. Discontinue Rizatriptan benzoate if these disturbances occur.</p><h3>Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain / Tightness / Pressure</h3><p class="First">As with other 5-HT <span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck and jaw commonly occur after treatment with Rizatriptan benzoate and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT <span class="Sub">1</span> agonists.</p><h3>Cerebrovascular Events</h3><p class="First">Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT <span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT <span class="Sub">1</span> agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack). Discontinue Rizatriptan benzoate if a cerebrovascular event occurs.</p><p>As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack <span class="Italics">[see  Contraindications (4)]</span> .</p><h3>Other Vasospasm Reactions</h3><p class="First">5-HT <span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, including Rizatriptan benzoate, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT <span class="Sub">1</span> agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating Tablets doses.</p><p>Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT <span class="Sub">1</span> agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT <span class="Sub">1</span> agonists have not been clearly established.</p><h3>Medication Overuse Headache</h3><p class="First">Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including Rizatriptan benzoate particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see  Drug Interactions (7.5)]</span> . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Rizatriptan benzoate treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected <span class="Italics">[see  Drug Interactions (7.4)and  Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></p><h3>Increase in Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension receiving 5-HT <span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, including Rizatriptan benzoate. In healthy young adult male and female patients who received maximal doses of Rizatriptan benzoate (10 mg every 2 hours for 3 doses), slight increases in blood pressure (approximately 2-3 mmHg) were observed. Rizatriptan benzoate is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension <span class="Italics">[see  Contraindications (4)]</span> .</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina <span class="Italics">[see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> .</li>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials</span></p><p>Adverse reactions to Rizatriptan benzoate were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included over 3,700 adult patients who received single or multiple doses ofRizatriptan benzoate. The most common adverse reactions during treatment with Rizatriptan benzoate (≥ 5% in either treatment group and greater than placebo) were asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose relatedTable 1 lists the adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 2% and greater than placebo) after a single dose of Rizatriptan benzoate in adults.</p><p>      Table 1 lists the adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 2% and greater than placebo) after a single dose of Rizatriptan benzoate in adults</p><p>The frequencies of adverse reactions in clinical trials did not increase when up to three doses were taken within 24 hours. Adverse reaction frequencies were also unchanged by concomitant use of drugs commonly taken for migraine prophylaxis (including propranolol), oral contraceptives, or analgesics. The incidences of adverse reactions were not affected by age or gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Other Events Observed in Association with the Administration of Rizatriptan Benzoate in Adults</span></span></p><p>In the following section, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse events are presented that were not reported in other sections of the labeling. Because the reports include events observed in open studies, the role of Rizatriptan benzoate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used Rizatriptan benzoate and reported an event divided by the total number of patients exposed to Rizatriptan benzoate (N = 3,716). All reported events occurred at an incidence ≥1%, or are believed to be reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those defined as those occurring in at least (&gt;) 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse experiences are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; and rare adverse experiences are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients</p><p><span class="Italics">General:</span> Infrequent was facial edema.

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and Rizatriptan benzoate within 24 hours is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see  Contraindications (4)]</span> .</p><h3>Agonists</h3><p class="First">Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of rizatriptan benzoate and other 5-HT <span class="Sub">1</span> agonists within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span> .</p><h3>SSRIs SNRIs and Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) <span class="Italics">[see  Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span> .</p><h3>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Rizatriptan benzoate is contraindicated in patients taking MAO-A inhibitors and non-selective MAO inhibitors. A specific MAO-A inhibitor increased the systemic exposure of rizatriptan and its metabolite <span class="Italics">[see  Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk summary</span></p><p>Available human data on the use of Rizatriptan Benzoate in pregnant women are not sufficient to draw conclusions about drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage.</p><p>In animal studies, developmental toxicity was observed following oral administration of rizatriptan during pregnancy (decreased fetal body  weightin rats) or throughout pregnancy and lactation (increased mortality, decreased body weight, and neurobehavioral impairment in rat offspring) at maternal plasma exposures greater than that expected at therapeutic doses in humans <span class="Italics">[see Animal Data].</span></p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine range from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which are similar to rates reported in women without migraine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</span></p><p>In women with migraine, there is an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes in the mother, including pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>The Pregnancy Registry for Rizatriptan Benzoate did not identify any pattern of congenital anomalies or other adverse birth outcomes over the period of 1998 to 2018. However, the lack of identification of any pattern should be viewed with caution, as the number of prospective reports with outcome information was low and did not provide sufficient power to detect an increased risk of individual birth defects associated with the use of Rizatriptan Benzoate. Additionally, there was significant loss to follow-up in the prospective pregnancy reports, further complicating this assessment of an association between Rizatriptan Benzoate and any pattern of congenital anomalies or other adverse birth outcomes.</p><p>In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 157 births with first-trimester exposure to rizatriptan, 7 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 1.01 [95% CI: 0.40 to 2.08]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for triptans before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 310 women who redeemed prescriptions for rizatriptan during the first trimester, 10 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.03 [95% CI: 0.55 to 1.93]), while for the 271 women who redeemed prescriptions for rizatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 12 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.48 [95% CI: 0.83 to 2.64]), each compared with the population comparison group.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>When rizatriptan (0, 2, 10, or 100 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis, a decrease in fetal body weight was observed at the highest doses tested. At the mid dose (10 mg/kg/day), which was a no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development, plasma exposure (AUC) was approximately 15 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 30 mg/day. When rizatriptan (0, 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis, no adverse fetal effects were observed. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the highest dose tested was 115 times that in humans at the MRHD. Placental transfer of drug to the fetus was demonstrated in both species.</p><p>Oral administration of rizatriptan (0, 2, 10, or 100 mg/kg/day) to female rats prior to and during mating and continuing throughout gestation and lactation resulted in reduced body weight in offspring from birth and throughout lactation at all but the lowest dose tested (2 mg/kg/day). Plasma exposure (AUC) at the no-effect dose (2 mg/kg/day) for adverse effects on postnatal development was similar to that in humans at the MRHD.</p><p>Oral administration of rizatriptan (0, 5, 100, or 250 mg/kg/day) throughout organogenesis and lactation resulted in neonatal mortality, reduced body weight (which persisted into adulthood), and impaired neurobehavioral function in offspring at all but the lowest dose tested. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development (5 mg/kg/day) was approximately 8 times that in humans at the MRHD.</p><h3>Lactaction</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of rizatriptan or any active metabolites in human milk, or on the effects of rizatriptan on the breastfed infant, or on milk production.</p><p>Rizatriptan was excreted in rat milk, with levels in milk approximately 6 times those in maternal plasma.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Rizatriptan Benzoate or Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Rizatriptan Benzoate or Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating tablets or from the underlying maternal condition</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>Following oral administration of rizatriptan to lactating rats at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day, drug concentrations of rizatriptan in milk samples exceeded maternal plasma drug concentrations by approximately 6-fold.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 6 years of age have not been established.</p><p>The efficacy and safety of rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets, USP in the acute treatment of migraine in patients aged 6 to 17 years was established in an adequate and well-controlled study <span class="Italics">[see  Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span> .</p><p>The incidence of adverse reactions reported for pediatric patients in the acute clinical trial was similar in patients who received rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets, USP to those who received placebo. The adverse reaction pattern in pediatric patients is expected to be similar to that in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of rizatriptan benzoate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><p>Although the pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan were similar in elderly (aged ≥ 65 years) and in younger adults (n=17), in general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, starting at the low end of the dosing range. This reflects the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>Geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of coronary artery disease) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving rizatriptan benzoate <span class="Italics">[see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> .</p><h3>Patients with Phenylketonuria</h3><p class="First">Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating Tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame).

Adverse reactions for 3 of these patients included abdominal discomfort, fatigue, and dyspnea.</p><p>In addition, based on the pharmacology of rizatriptan benzoate hypertension or myocardial ischemia could occur after overdosage. Gastrointestinal decontamination, (i.e., gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal) should be considered in patients suspected of an overdose with Rizatriptan benzoate. Clinical and electrocardiographic monitoring should be continued for at least 12 hours, even if clinical symptoms are not observed.</p><p>The effects of hemo- or peritoneal dialysis on serum concentrations of rizatriptan are unknown.</p><h2>Rizatriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating Tablet contains rizatriptan benzoate, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5- 1B/1D HT ) receptor agonist. Rizatriptan benzoate is described 1B/1D chemically as: N,N-dimethyl-5-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1H-indole-3-ethanamine monobenzoate and its structural formula is:</p><p> </p><p>Its empirical formula is C <span class="Sub">15</span>H <span class="Sub">19</span>N <span class="Sub">5</span>C <span class="Sub">7</span>H <span class="Sub">6</span>O <span class="Sub">2</span>, representing a molecular weight of the free base of 269.4. Rizatriptan Benzoate is a white to off-white crystalline solid that is soluble in water at about 42 mg per mL (expressed as free base) at 25°C.</p><p>Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating Tablets are available for oral administration in strengths of 5 and 10 mg (corresponding to 7.265 mg or 14.53 mg of the benzoate salt, respectively). Each compressed tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, xylitol, anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate, crospovidone, mannitol, sodium stearyl fumarate, aspartame, isopropyl alcohol and menthol.</p><h2>Rizatriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Rizatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT <span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptors. Rizatriptan benzoate presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache by binding to 5- HT <span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptors located on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Rizatriptan is completely absorbed following oral administration. The mean oral absolute bioavailability of the rizatriptan benzoate tablet is about 45%, and mean peak plasma concentrations (C <span class="Sub">max</span>) are reached in approximately 1 - 1.5 hours (T <span class="Sub">max</span>). The presence of a migraine headache did not appear to affect the absorption or pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of rizatriptan but delays the time to reach peak concentration by an hour. In clinical trials, rizatriptan benzoate was administered without regard to food.</p><p>The bioavailability and Cmax of rizatriptan were similar following administration of rizatriptan benzoate tablets and rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets but the rate of absorption is somewhat slower with Rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets with Tmax delayed by up to 0.7 hour. AUC of rizatriptan is approximately 30% higher in females than in males. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The mean volume of distribution is approximately 140 liters in male subjects and 110 liters in female subjects. Rizatriptan is minimally bound (14%) to plasma proteins.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>The primary route of rizatriptan metabolism is via oxidative deamination by monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) to the indole acetic acid metabolite, which is not active at the 5-HT <span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptor. N-monodesmethyl-rizatriptan, a metabolite with activity similar to that of parent compound at the 5-HT <span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptor, is formed to a minor degree. Plasma concentrations of N-monodesmethyl-rizatriptan are approximately 14% of those of parent compound, and it is eliminated at a similar rate. Other minor metabolites, the N-oxide, the 6-hydroxy compound, and the sulfate conjugate of the 6-hydroxy metabolite are not active at the 5-HT <span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptor.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>The total radioactivity of the administered dose recovered over 120 hours in urine and feces was 82% and 12%, respectively, following a single 10-mg oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-rizatriptan. Following oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-rizatriptan, rizatriptan accounted for about 17% of circulating plasma radioactivity. Approximately 14% of an oral dose is excreted in urine as unchanged rizatriptan while 51% is excreted as indole acetic acid metabolite, indicating substantial first-pass metabolism.</p><p>The plasma half-life of rizatriptan in males and females averages 2 to 3 hours.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Cytochrome P450 Isoforms</span></span></p><p>Rizatriptan is not an inhibitor of the activities of human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms 3A4/5, 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, or 2E1; rizatriptan is a competitive inhibitor (Ki=1400 nM) of cytochrome P450 2D6, but only at high, clinically irrelevant concentrations.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Geriatric</span>: Rizatriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65 - 77 years) were similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18 - 45 years).</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric</span>: The pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan was determined in pediatric migraineurs 6 to 17 years of age. Exposures following single dose administration of 5 mg Rizatriptan benzoate to pediatric patients weighing 20-39 kg (44-87 lb) or 10 mg Rizatriptan benzoate to pediatric patients weighing ≥40 kg (88 lb) were similar to those observed following single dose administration of 10 mg rizatriptan benzoate to adults.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gender</span>: The mean AUC <span class="Sub">0-∞</span> and C <span class="Sub">max</span> of rizatriptan (10 mg orally) were about 30% and 11% higher in females as compared to males, respectively, while Tmax occurred at approximately the same time.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment:</span> Following oral administration in patients with hepatic impairment caused by mild to moderate alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, plasma concentrations of rizatriptan were similar in patients with mild hepatic insufficiency compared to a control group of subjects with normal hepatic function; plasma concentrations of rizatriptan were approximately 30% greater in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span>: In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 - 60 mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span>), the AUC <span class="Sub">0-∞</span> of rizatriptan was not significantly different from that in subjects with normal renal function. In hemodialysis patients, (creatinine clearance &lt; 2 mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span>), however, the AUC for rizatriptan was approximately 44% greater than that in patients with normal renal function.</p><p><span class="Italics">Race</span>: Pharmacokinetic data revealed no significant differences between African American and Caucasian subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">[See also Drug Interactions (7).]</span></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors:</span></span> Rizatriptan is principally metabolized via monoamine oxidase, 'A' subtype (MAO-A). Plasma concentrations of rizatriptan may be increased by drugs that are selective MAO-A inhibitors (e.g., moclobemide) or nonselective MAO inhibitors [type A and B] (e.g., isocarboxazid, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, and pargyline). In a drug interaction study, when rizatriptan 10 mg was administered to subjects (n=12) receiving concomitant therapy with the selective, reversible MAO-A inhibitor, moclobemide 150 mg t.i.d., there were mean increases in rizatriptan AUC and Cmax of 119% and 41% respectively; and the AUC of the active N-monodesmethyl metabolite of rizatriptan was increased more than 400%.

Patients enrolled in these studies were primarily female (84%) and Caucasian (88%), with a mean age of 40 years (range of 18 to 71). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction of moderate or severe headache pain to no or mild headache pain, was assessed for up to 2 hours (Study 1) or up to 4 hours after dosing (Studies 2, 3 and 4). Associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia and maintenance of response up to 24 hours post-dose were evaluated. A second dose of Rizatriptan benzoate tablets was allowed 2 to 24 hours after dosing for treatment of recurrent headache in Studies 1 and 2. Additional analgesics and/or antiemetics were allowed 2 hours after initial treatment for rescue in all four studies.</p><p>In all studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater in patients who received either Rizatriptan benzoate 5 or 10 mg compared to those who received placebo. In a separate study, doses of 2.5 mg were not different from placebo. Doses greater than 10 mg were associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects. The results from the four controlled studies are summarized in Table 2.</p><p>Comparisons of drug performance based upon results obtained in different clinical trials may not be reliable. Because studies are conducted at different times, with different samples of patients, by different investigators, employing different criteria and/or different interpretations of the same criteria, under different conditions (dose, dosing regimen, etc.), quantitative estimates of treatment response and the timing of response may be expected to vary considerably from study to study.</p><p>The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response within 2 hours following treatment in pooled Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4 is depicted in Figure 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Estimated Probability of Achieving an Initial Headache Response by 2 Hours in Pooled Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4</span>*</p><p>*Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier plot of the probability over time of obtaining headache response (no or mild pain) following treatment with rizatriptan benzoate tablet or placebo.

The patient population was historically non-responsive to NSAIDs and acetaminophen therapy.</p><p>Patients were instructed to treat a single migraine attack with headache pain of moderate to severe intensity. The treatment phase of the study had two stages. Stage 1 was used to identify placebo non-responders, who then entered into Stage 2, in which patients were randomized to rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets or placebo. Using a weight-based dosing strategy, patients 20 kg to &lt;40 kg (44 lb to &lt;88 lb) received Rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets 5 mg or placebo, and patients ≥40 kg (88 lb) received Rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets 10 mg or placebo.</p><p>The mean age for the studied patient population was 13 years.
