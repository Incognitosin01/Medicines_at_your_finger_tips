-Inspect the regulator valve for traces of dirt, dust, oil or grease. Dirt and dust can be removed safely with a lint free cloth.</p><p>WARNING: If oil or grease is visible or suspected do not use the system.<br/>
- With the regulator valve's barbed outlet facing away from you, activate the control knob clockwise to purge any undetectable debris from the regulator valve, then turn off the regulator valve                                                                                                                    <br/>
- Attach the oxygen supply tubing to the regulator valve's barbed outlet connection located below the control knob.<br/>
- Turn the graduated knob clockwise to the flow rate prescribed by the physician<br/>
- When the pressure gauge shows less than1/4 full, the cylinder should be exchanged for a full cylinder to ensure an adequate supply of oxygen<br/>
- When finished using oxygen, turn the flow of oxygen to "OFF" by turning the knob counter-clockwise to the off position.<br/>
<br/>
If any hissing sound can be heard indicating a leak, do not force the knob counter-clockwise past the positive stop at the off position. Should a leak occur, remove the system from service and place it outdoors. Tag for defect and return it for repair.
