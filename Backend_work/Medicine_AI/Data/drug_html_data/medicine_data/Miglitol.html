This decreases the amount of sugar that passes into your blood after a meal and prevents periods of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar).</p><p>Miglitol is used together with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Miglitol may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use miglitol if you have inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's), a blockage in your intestines, a chronic intestinal disorder that affects digestion, or a stomach disorder that causes excess gas. Do not take miglitol if you are in a state of diabetic ketoacidosis.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use miglitol if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>an inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a chronic intestinal disorder that affects your digestion;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>blockage in your intestines;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a stomach disorder that causes excess gas; or</p>

Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while using  miglitol.</p><p>Miglitol can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. You should not breast-feed while using this medicine.</p><p>Do not give this medication to anyone under 18 years old without medical advice.</p><h2>How should I take miglitol?</h2><p>Miglitol is usually taken 3 times per day at the start of a meal. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Take each dose with the first bite of a main meal.</p><p>Low blood sugar <b>(hypoglycemia)</b> can happen to everyone who has diabetes. Symptoms include headache, hunger, sweating, irritability, dizziness, nausea, fast heart rate, and feeling anxious or shaky.</p><p>To quickly treat low blood sugar while you are taking miglitol, use a dextrose-based source of sugar (such as honey, dates, raisins, plums, or apricots). A sucrose-based source of sugar may not work because miglitol can inhibit the action of sucrose in the body. Sucrose-based sugar sources include cane sugar, candy, table sugar, chocolate, syrup, and non-diet soda or other sweetened foods.</p><p>Your doctor can prescribe a glucagon emergency injection kit to use in case you have severe hypoglycemia and cannot eat or drink. Be sure your family and close friends know how to give you this injection in an emergency.</p><p>Blood sugar levels can be affected by stress, illness, surgery, exercise, alcohol use, or skipping meals. <b>Ask your doctor before changing your dose or medication schedule.</b></p><p>Miglitol is only part of a complete treatment program that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, regular blood sugar testing, and special medical care. Follow your doctor's instructions very closely.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take your dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking miglitol?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Miglitol side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction</b>: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
