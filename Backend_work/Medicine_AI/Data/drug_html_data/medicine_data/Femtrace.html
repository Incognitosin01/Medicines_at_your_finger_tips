Estrogen is necessary for many processes in the body.</p><p>Femtrace is used to treat symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, and vaginal dryness, burning, and irritation. Other uses include prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, and replacement of estrogen in women with ovarian failure or other conditions that cause a lack of natural estrogen in the body. Femtrace is sometimes used as part of cancer treatment in women and men.</p><p>Femtrace may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Femtrace can harm an unborn baby or cause birth defects. Do not use Femtrace if you are pregnant. You should not take Femtrace if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding, liver disease, breast or uterine cancer, hormone-dependent cancer, a recent history of heart attack or stroke, if you are pregnant, if you have ever had a blood clot (especially in your lung or your lower body), or if you are allergic to any medicines or food dyes. Taking hormones can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack, especially if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or triglycerides, if you smoke, or if you are overweight.</p><p>Long-term Femtrace treatment may increase your risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or uterine cancer. Talk with your doctor about your individual risks before using Femtrace long-term. Your doctor should check your progress every 3 to 6 months to determine whether you should continue this treatment.</p><p>Taking progestin while using Femtrace may lower your risk of uterine cancer. If your uterus has not been removed, your doctor may prescribe a progestin for you to take while you are using Femtrace.</p><p>Femtrace should not be used to prevent heart disease, stroke, or dementia, because this medication may actually increase your risk of developing these conditions.</p><p>Have regular physical exams and mammograms, and self-examine your breasts for lumps on a monthly basis while using Femtrace.</p><h2>Before using Femtrace</h2><p>You should not take Femtrace if you are allergic to estradiol, or if you have:</p><ul>
