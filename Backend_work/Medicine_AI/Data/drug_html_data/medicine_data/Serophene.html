Follow your doctor's instructions carefully. Ovulation is controlled by luteinizing hormone (LH). LH is present in the blood and urine in very small amounts during most of the menstrual cycle but rises suddenly for a short time in the middle of the menstrual cycle. This sharp rise, the LH surge, usually causes ovulation within about 30 hours. A woman is most likely to become pregnant if she has intercourse within the 24 hours after detecting the LH surge. Ovulation prediction test kits are used to test for this large amount of LH in the urine. This method is better for predicting ovulation than measuring daily basal body temperature. It is important that intercourse take place at the correct time to give you the best chance of becoming pregnant.</p><p>There is a chance that clomiphene may cause birth defects if it is taken after you become pregnant. Stop taking this medicine and tell your doctor immediately if you think you have become pregnant while still taking clomiphene.</p><p>This medicine may cause blurred vision, difficulty in reading, or other changes in vision. It may also cause some people to become dizzy or lightheaded. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not clear-headed or able to see well. If these reactions are especially bothersome, check with your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Serophene side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
