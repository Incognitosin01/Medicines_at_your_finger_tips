It is also used before a surgical procedure to make a person sleep (be unconscious).</p><p>Butabarbital belongs to the group of medicines called barbiturates. They act in the central nervous system (CNS) to slow down the nervous system. When used to treat insomnia, butabarbital will help you get to sleep faster and sleep throughout the night. In most cases, sleep medicines should only be used for short periods of time, such as 1 or 2 days, and for no longer than 1 or 2 weeks.</p><p>Butabarbital is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using butabarbital</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For butabarbital, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to butabarbital or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of butabarbital in children when used before a surgical procedure. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children to treat insomnia.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of butabarbital in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of butabarbital and are more likely to have age-related liver or kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving butabarbital.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking butabarbital, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using butabarbital with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Using butabarbital while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Birth control pills may not work as well to prevent pregnancy when used with butabarbital. Use another form of birth control (eg, condoms, spermicide) along with your pills. If you think you have become pregnant while using butabarbital, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>If you think you need to take butabarbital for more than 7 to 10 days, be sure to discuss it with your doctor. Insomnia that lasts longer than this may be a sign of another medical problem.</p><p>Butabarbital may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hives, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or throat while you are using butabarbital.</p><p>Butabarbital contains a yellow dye called tartrazine, which may cause severe allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any allergies, including an allergy to aspirin, or asthma.</p><p>Butabarbital will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. <i>Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are using butabarbital</i>.</p><p>Butabarbital may cause some people, especially older persons, to become drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, clumsy or unsteady, or less alert than they are normally, which may lead to falls. Even though butabarbital is taken at bedtime, it may cause some people to feel drowsy or less alert on arising. <i>Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how butabarbital affects you</i>.</p><p>If you develop any unusual and strange thoughts or behavior while you are using butabarbital, be sure to discuss it with your doctor. Some changes that have occurred in people using butabarbital are like those seen in people who drink alcohol and then act in a manner that is not normal. Other changes may be more unusual and extreme, such as confusion, worsening of depression, hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there), suicidal thoughts, and unusual excitement, nervousness, or irritability.</p><p>Butabarbital may cause you to do things while you are still asleep that you may not remember the next morning. It is possible you could drive a car, sleepwalk, have sex, make phone calls, or prepare and eat food while you are asleep or not fully awake. Tell your doctor right away if you learn that any of these has happened.</p><p><i>Do not change your dose or stop using it without first checking with your doctor</i>. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping completely. Stopping butabarbital suddenly may cause withdrawal side effects.</p><p><i>If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of butabarbital, get emergency help at once</i>. Taking an overdose of butabarbital or taking alcohol or other CNS depressants with butabarbital may lead to serious breathing problems and unconsciousness. <i>Some signs of an overdose include</i>: severe drowsiness, severe nausea or vomiting, staggering, and troubled breathing.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Butabarbital side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
