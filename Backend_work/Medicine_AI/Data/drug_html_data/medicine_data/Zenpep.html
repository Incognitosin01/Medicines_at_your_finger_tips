These enzymes are normally produced by the pancreas and are important in the digestion of fats, proteins, and sugars.</p><p>Zenpep is used to replace these enzymes when the body does not have enough of its own. Certain medical conditions can cause this lack of enzymes, including cystic fibrosis, chronic inflammation of the pancreas, or blockage of the pancreatic ducts.</p><p>Zenpep may also be used following surgical removal of the pancreas.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not take Zenpep if you are allergic to pork proteins.</p><p><b>Call your doctor at once if you have symptoms of a rare but serious bowel disorder:</b> severe or unusual stomach pain, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea, or constipation.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not take Zenpep if you are allergic to pork proteins.</p><p>To make sure Zenpep is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
