</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Curosurf</h2><p class="First">Curosurf<span class="Sup">®</span> (poractant alfa) Intratracheal Suspension is indicated for the rescue treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in premature infants.  Curosurf reduces mortality and pneumothoraces associated with RDS.</p><h2>Curosurf Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>2.1 Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">For intratracheal administration only.</p><p>Curosurf should be administered by, or under the supervision of clinicians experienced in intubation, ventilator management, and general care of premature infants. Before administering Curosurf, assure proper placement and patency of the endotracheal tube. At the discretion of the clinician, the endotracheal tube may be suctioned before administering Curosurf. Allow the infant to stabilize before proceeding with dosing.</p><p>Administer Curosurf either:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Intratracheally by instillation in two divided aliquots through a 5 French end-hole catheter or</span></li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Intratracheally in a single bolus through the secondary lumen of a dual lumen endotracheal tube without interrupting mechanical ventilation.</span></li>
</ul><h3>2.2 Recommended Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The initial recommended dose is 2.5 mL/kg birth weight, administered as one or two aliquots depending upon the instillation procedure <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Up to two repeat doses of 1.25 mL/kg birth weight each may be administered at approximately 12-hour intervals in infants in whom RDS is considered responsible for their persisting or deteriorating respiratory status. The maximum recommended total dosage (sum of the initial and up to two repeat doses) is 5 mL/kg.</span></p><h3>2.3 Preparation of the Curosurf Suspension</h3><h3>2.4 Administration</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="following_xmChange">For endotracheal tube instillation using a 5 French end-hole catheter</span></span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="following_xmChange">For the first dose: 1.25 mL/kg (birth weight) per aliquot</span></li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">For each repeated dose: 0.625 mL/kg (birth weight) per aliquot</span></li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">For endotracheal instillation using the secondary lumen of a dual lumen endotracheal tube</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Curosurf (poractant alfa) is an intratracheal suspension available in vials:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>1.5 mL [120 mg poractant alfa (surfactant extract)], or</li>
<li>3 mL [240 mg poractant alfa (surfactant extract)].</li>
</ul><p>Curosurf is a white to creamy white suspension.  Each mL of suspension contains 80 mg poractant alfa (surfactant extract) that includes 76 mg of phospholipids and 1 mg of protein of which 0.45 mg is SP-B and 0.59 mg is SP-C.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"> None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>5.1 Acute Changes in Oxygenation and Lung Compliance</h3><p class="First">The administration of exogenous surfactants, including Curosurf, can rapidly affect oxygenation and lung compliance. Therefore, infants receiving Curosurf should receive frequent clinical and laboratory assessments so that oxygen and ventilatory support can be modified to respond to respiratory changes. Curosurf should only be administered by those trained and experienced in the care, resuscitation, and stabilization of pre-term infants.</p><h3>5.2 Administration-Related Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Transient adverse reactions associated with administration of Curosurf include bradycardia, hypotension, endotracheal tube blockage, and oxygen desaturation. These events require stopping Curosurf administration and taking appropriate measures to alleviate the condition. After the patient is stable, dosing may proceed with appropriate monitoring.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>6.1 Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Studies in Premature Infants with Respiratory Distress Syndrome</span></p><p>The safety data described below reflect exposure to Curosurf at a single dose of 2.5 mL/kg (200 mg/kg), in 78 infants of 700-2000 grams birth weight with RDS requiring mechanical ventilation and a FiO<span class="Sub">2 </span> ≥ 0.60 (Study 1) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)].</span> A total of 144 infants were studied after RDS developed and before 15 hours of age; 78 infants received Curosurf 2.5 mL/kg single dose (200 mg/kg), and 66 infants received control treatment (disconnection from the ventilator and manual ventilation for 2 minutes).</p><p>Transient adverse effects seen with the administration of Curosurf included bradycardia, hypotension, endotracheal tube blockage, and oxygen desaturation. The rates of the most common serious complications associated with prematurity and RDS observed in Study 1 are shown in Table 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1:  Most Common Serious Complications Associated with Prematurity and RDS in Study 1</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Curosurf 2.5 mL/kg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n=78</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTROL*</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n=66</span></p><p class="First">Acquired Pneumonia</p><p class="First">17%</p><p class="First">21%</p><p class="First">Acquired Septicemia</p><p class="First">14%</p><p class="First">18%</p><p class="First">Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia</p><p class="First">18%</p><p class="First">22%</p><p class="First">Intracranial Hemorrhage</p><p class="First">51%</p><p class="First">64%</p><p class="First">Patent Ductus Arteriosus</p><p class="First">60%</p><p class="First">48%</p><p class="First">Pneumothorax</p><p class="First">21%</p><p class="First">36%</p><p class="First">Pulmonary Interstitial Emphysema</p><p class="First">21%</p><p class="First">38%</p><p>*Control patients were disconnected from the ventilator and manually ventilated for 2 minutes.  No surfactant was instilled.</p><p>Seventy-six infants (45 treated with Curosurf) from study 1 were evaluated at 1 year of age and 73 infants (44 treated with Curosurf) were evaluated at 2 years of age to assess for potential long-term adverse reactions. Data from follow-up evaluations for weight and length, persistent respiratory symptoms, incidence of cerebral palsy, visual impairment, or auditory impairment was similar between treatment groups. In 16 patients (10 treated with Curosurf and 6 controls) evaluated at 5.5 years of age, the developmental quotient, derived using the Griffiths Mental Developmental Scales, was similar between groups.</p><h3>6.2 Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">Immunological studies have not demonstrated differences in levels of surfactant-anti-surfactant immune complexes and anti-Curosurf antibodies between patients treated with Curosurf and patients who received control treatment.</p><h3>6.3 Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">Pulmonary hemorrhage, a known complication of premature birth and very low birth-weight, has been reported both in clinical trials with Curosurf and in postmarketing adverse event reports in infants who had received Curosurf.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>8.4 Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Curosurf is indicated for the rescue treatment, including the reduction of mortality and pneumothoraces, of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in premature infants <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1) and Dosage Administration (2)].</span></p><p>The safety and efficacy of Curosurf in the treatment of full term infants or older pediatric patients with respiratory failure has not been established.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There have been no reports of overdosage following the administration of Curosurf.</p><p>In the event of accidental overdosage, and  if there are clear clinical effects on the infant's respiration, ventilation, or oxygenation, aspirate as much of the suspension as possible and provide the infant with supportive treatment, with particular attention to fluid and electrolyte balance.</p><h2>Curosurf Description</h2><p class="First">Curosurf (poractant alfa) is a sterile, non-pyrogenic pulmonary surfactant intended for intratracheal use only. Curosurf is an extract of natural porcine lung surfactant consisting of 99% polar lipids (mainly phospholipids) and 1% hydrophobic low molecular weight proteins (surfactant associated proteins SP-B and SP-C).</p><p>Curosurf is a white to creamy white suspension of poractant alfa.  Each milliliter of suspension contains 80 mg of poractant alfa (surfactant extract) that includes 76 mg of phospholipids and 1 mg of protein of which 0.45 mg is SP-B and 0.59 mg is SP-C.  The amount of phospholipids is calculated from the content of phosphorus and contains 55 mg of phosphatidylcholine of which 30 mg is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine.  It is suspended in 0.9% sodium chloride solution.  The pH is adjusted with sodium bicarbonate to a pH of 6.2 (5.5 to 6.5).</p><p>Curosurf contains no preservatives.</p><h2>Curosurf - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Endogenous pulmonary surfactant reduces surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveoli during ventilation and stabilizes the alveoli against collapse at resting transpulmonary pressures. A deficiency of pulmonary surfactant in preterm infants results in Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) characterized by poor lung expansion, inadequate gas exchange, and a gradual collapse of the lungs (atelectasis).</p><p>Curosurf compensates for the deficiency of surfactant and restores surface activity to the lungs of these infants.</p><h3>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> - Curosurf lowers minimum surface tension to ≤ 4mN/m as measured by the Wilhelmy Balance System.</p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Curosurf is administered directly to the lung, where biophysical effects occur at the alveolar surface. No human pharmacokinetic studies have been performed to characterize the absorption, biotransformation, or elimination of Curosurf.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Studies to assess potential carcinogenic effects of Curosurf have not been conducted.</p><p>Poractant alfa was negative for genotoxicity in the following assays: bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), gene mutation assay in Chinese hamster V79 cells, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, unscheduled DNA synthesis in HELA S3 cells, and in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.</p><p>No studies to assess reproductive effects of Curosurf have been performed.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>14.1 Rescue Treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome</h3><p class="First">The clinical efficacy of Curosurf in the treatment of established Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in premature infants  was demonstrated in one single-dose study (Study 1) and one multiple-dose study (Study 2) involving approximately 500 infants. Each study was randomized, multicenter, and controlled.</p><p>In study 1, premature infants 700 to 2000 grams birth weight with RDS requiring mechanical ventilation and a FiO<span class="Sub">2</span> ≥ 0.60 were enrolled. Curosurf 2.5 mL/kg single dose (200 mg/kg) or control (disconnection from the ventilator and manual ventilation for 2 minutes) was administered after RDS developed and before 15 hours of age. The results from Study 1 are shown below in Table 2.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2:  Study 1 Results in Premature Infants with Respiratory Distress Syndrome</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Efficacy Parameter</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Single Dose</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Curosurf</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n=78</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Control</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n=67</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">p-Value</span></p><p class="First">Mortality at 28 Days (All Causes)</p><p class="First">31%</p><p class="First">48%</p><p class="First">≤0.05</p><p class="First">Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia*</p><p class="First">18%</p><p class="First">22%</p><p class="First">N.S.</p><p class="First">Pneumothorax</p><p class="First">21%</p><p class="First">36%</p><p class="First">≤0.05</p><p class="First">Pulmonary Interstitial Emphysema</p><p class="First">21%</p><p class="First">38%</p><p class="First">≤0.05</p><p>*Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) diagnosed by positive x-ray and supplemental oxygen dependence at 28 days of life.</p><p>N.S.:  not statistically significant</p><p>In Study 2, premature infants 700 to 2000 g birth weight with RDS requiring mechanical ventilation and a FiO<span class="Sub">2</span> ≥ 0.60 were enrolled.
