</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Entyvio Injection</h2><p class="First">ENTYVIO is indicated in adults for the treatment of:</p><ul>
<li>moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.</li>
<li>moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.</li>
</ul><h2>Entyvio Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Preparation and Administration Instructions</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Administer ENTYVIO as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus.</li>
<li>Reconstitute ENTYVIO lyophilized powder with Sterile Water for Injection and dilute in 250 mL of sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or sterile Lactated Ringer's Injection prior to administration <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</li>
<li>After the infusion is complete, flush with 30 mL of sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or sterile Lactated Ringer's Injection.</li>
<li>ENTYVIO should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, if they occur <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. Appropriate monitoring and medical support measures should be available for immediate use. Observe patients during infusion and until the infusion is complete.</li>
</ul><h3>Prior to Administration of ENTYVIO</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Prior to initiating treatment with ENTYVIO, all patients should be brought up to date with all immunizations according to current immunization guidelines.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosage in Adults with Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's Disease</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of ENTYVIO in adults with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease is 300 mg administered by intravenous infusion at zero, two and six weeks and then every eight weeks thereafter.</p><p>Discontinue therapy in patients who show no evidence of therapeutic benefit by Week 14.</p><h3>Reconstitution and Dilution Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Reconstitution Instructions</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Dilution Instructions</span></p><p>Add the 5 mL (300 mg) of reconstituted ENTYVIO solution to 250 mL of sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringer's Injection and gently mix the infusion bag. Do not add other medicinal products to the prepared infusion solution or intravenous infusion set. Once reconstituted and diluted, use the infusion solution as soon as possible.</p><p><span class="Bold">Discard any unused portion of the infusion solution.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Storage</span></p><p>Specific storage conditions and timing for the reconstituted solution in vial and diluted solution in the infusion bag are outlined in <span class="Italics">Table 1</span>.</p><p>Do not freeze the reconstituted solution in the vial or the diluted solution in the infusion bag.</p><p>The combined storage time of reconstituted ENTYVIO solution in the vial and the diluted solution in the infusion bag with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is a total of 12 hours at room temperature (20° to 25°C [68° to 77°F]) or 24 hours refrigerated (2° to 8°C [36° to 46°F]). This combined storage time may include up to eight hours of the reconstituted solution in the vial at 2° to 8°C.</p><p>The combined storage time of reconstituted ENTYVIO solution in the vial and the diluted solution in the infusion bag with Lactated Ringer's Injection is a total of six hours refrigerated (2° to 8°C [36° to 46°F]).</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">For injection: 300 mg of vedolizumab as a white to off-white lyophilized cake in a single-dose vial for reconstitution.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">ENTYVIO is contraindicated in patients who have had a known serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction to ENTYVIO or any of its excipients (such as dyspnea, bronchospasm, urticaria, flushing, rash and increased heart rate) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Infusion-Related Reactions and Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, including anaphylaxis, dyspnea, bronchospasm, urticaria, flushing, rash, and increased blood pressure and heart rate <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.3)]</span>. These reactions may occur with the first or subsequent infusions of ENTYVIO and may vary in their time of onset from during infusion or up to several hours post-infusion.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">If anaphylaxis or other serious infusion-related or hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue administration of ENTYVIO immediately and initiate appropriate treatment.</span></p><h3>Infections</h3><p class="First">Patients treated with ENTYVIO are at increased risk for developing infections <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> The most commonly reported infections in clinical trials occurring at a rate greater on ENTYVIO than placebo involved the upper respiratory and nasal mucosa (e.g., nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection). Serious infections have also been reported in patients treated with ENTYVIO, including anal abscess, sepsis (some fatal), tuberculosis, salmonella sepsis, Listeria meningitis, giardiasis and cytomegaloviral colitis.</p><p>ENTYVIO is not recommended in patients with active, severe infections until the infections are controlled. Consider withholding treatment in patients who develop a severe infection while on treatment with ENTYVIO. Exercise caution when considering the use of ENTYVIO in patients with a history of recurring severe infections. Consider screening for tuberculosis (TB) according to the local practice. For progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>.</p><h3>Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">PML, a rare and often fatal opportunistic infection of the central nervous system (CNS), has been reported with systemic immunosuppressants, including another integrin receptor antagonist. PML is caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus and typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised. One case of PML in an ENTYVIO-treated patient with multiple contributory factors has been reported in the postmarketing setting (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection with a CD4 count of 300 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> and prior and concomitant immunosuppression). Although unlikely, a risk of PML cannot be ruled out.</span></p><p>Monitor patients on ENTYVIO for any new onset, or worsening, of neurological signs and symptoms. Typical signs and symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months. If PML is suspected, withhold dosing with ENTYVIO and refer to a neurologist; if confirmed, discontinue dosing permanently.</p><h3>Liver Injury</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of elevations of transaminase and/or bilirubin in patients receiving ENTYVIO. In general, the combination of transaminase elevations and elevated bilirubin without evidence of obstruction is generally recognized as an important predictor of severe liver injury that may lead to death or the need for a liver transplant in some patients. ENTYVIO should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or other evidence of significant liver injury <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Live and Oral Vaccines</h3><p class="First">Prior to initiating treatment with ENTYVIO, all patients should be brought up to date with all immunizations according to current immunization guidelines <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>. Patients receiving ENTYVIO may receive non-live vaccines (e.g., influenza vaccine injection) and may receive live vaccines if the benefits outweigh the risks. There are no data on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving ENTYVIO <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following topics are also discussed in detail in the Warnings and Precautions section:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Infusion-Related Reactions and Hypersensitivity Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Infections <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
<li>Liver Injury <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to ENTYVIO in 3,326 patients and healthy volunteers in clinical trials, including 1,396 exposed for greater than one year, and 835 exposed for greater than two years.</p><p>The safety data described in <span class="Italics">Table 2</span> are derived from four controlled Phase 3 trials (UC Trials I and II, and CD Trials I and III); data from patients receiving open-label ENTYVIO treatment at Weeks 0 and 2 (prior to entry into UC Trial II and CD Trial III) and from Weeks 6 to 52 (non-responders at Week 6 of UC Trial I and CD Trial I) are included <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)]</span>.</p><p>In these trials, 1,434 patients received ENTYVIO 300 mg for up to 52 weeks, and 297 patients received placebo for up to 52 weeks. Of these, 769 patients had ulcerative colitis and 962 patients had Crohn's disease. Patients were exposed for a mean duration of 259 days (UC Trials I and II) and 247 days (CD Trials I and III).</p><p>Adverse reactions were reported in 52% of patients treated with ENTYVIO and 45% of patients treated with placebo (UC Trials I and II: 49% with ENTYVIO and 37% with placebo; CD Trials I and III: 55% with ENTYVIO and 47% with placebo). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 7% of patients treated with ENTYVIO compared to 4% of patients treated with placebo (UC Trials I and II: 8% with ENTYVIO and 7% with placebo; CD Trials I and III: 12% with ENTYVIO and 9%, with placebo).</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (reported by ≥3% of patients treated with ENTYVIO in the UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III combined group and ≥1% higher than in combined placebo group) were nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, nausea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, cough, bronchitis, influenza, back pain, rash, pruritus, sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain and pain in extremities <span class="Italics">(Table 2)</span>.</p><p>Safety data for patients (n=279) in UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III who received ENTYVIO at Weeks 0 and 2 and were then randomized to placebo at Week 6 for up to 52 weeks, and for patients (n=416) in CD Trial II, a 10 week Crohn's disease trial, are similar to those listed in <span class="Italics">Table 2</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Infusion-Related Reactions and Hypersensitivity Reactions</span></p><p>Serious infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported following ENTYVIO administration in clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. In UC Trials I and II and Crohn's Trials I and III, one case of anaphylaxis [one out of 1,434 patients treated with ENTYVIO (0.07%)] was reported by a Crohn's disease patient during the second infusion (symptoms reported were dyspnea, bronchospasm, urticaria, flushing, rash and increased blood pressure and heart rate) and was managed with discontinuation of infusion and treatment with antihistamine and intravenous hydrocortisone.</p><p>In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, 4% of patients treated with ENTYVIO and 3% of patients treated with placebo experienced an infusion-related reaction (IRR). The most frequently observed IRR in the patients treated with ENTYVIO (reported more than twice) were nausea, headache, pruritus, dizziness, fatigue, infusion-related reaction, pyrexia, urticaria and vomiting (each of these adverse reactions occurred in &lt;1% in all patients treated with ENTYVIO) and no individual adverse reaction reported occurred at a rate above 1%. These reactions generally occurred within the first two hours after the infusion and resolved with no treatment or following antihistamine and/or IV hydrocortisone treatment. Less than 1% of patients treated with ENTYVIO had IRRs assessed by the investigator as severe, and IRRs requiring discontinuation of study treatment occurred in &lt;1%.</p><p>In clinical trials, for patients with mild IRRs or hypersensitivity reactions, physicians were allowed to pretreat with standard medical treatment (e.g., antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or acetaminophen) prior to next infusion.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Infections</span></p><p>In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, the rate of infections was 0.85 per patient-year in the patients treated with ENTYVIO and 0.7 per patient-year in the patients treated with placebo <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, and urinary tract infection. Two percent of patients discontinued ENTYVIO due to infections.</p><p>In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, the rate of serious infections was 0.07 per patient-year in patients treated with ENTYVIO and 0.06 per patient-year in patients treated with placebo. Serious infections were more common in Crohn's disease patients than ulcerative colitis patients, and anal abscesses were the most frequently reported serious adverse reaction in Crohn's disease patients. Over 48 months, there was no increase in the rate of serious infections.</p><p>In controlled- and open-label long-term extension trials in adults treated with ENTYVIO, serious infections have been reported, including anal abscess, sepsis (some fatal), tuberculosis, salmonella sepsis, Listeria meningitis, giardiasis and cytomegaloviral colitis.</p><p>In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, sepsis, including bacterial sepsis and septic shock, was reported in four of 1,434 (0.3%) patients treated with ENTYVIO and in two of 297 patients treated with placebo (0.7%). During these trials, two Crohn's disease patients treated with ENTYVIO died due to reported sepsis or septic shock; both patients had significant comorbidities and a complicated hospital course that contributed to the deaths. In an open-label, long-term extension trial, additional cases of sepsis (some fatal), including bacterial sepsis and septic shock, were reported. The rate of sepsis in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease receiving ENTYVIO was two per 1,000 patient-years.</p><p>In clinical trials, all patients were screened for tuberculosis. One case of latent, pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed during the controlled trials with ENTYVIO. Additional cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were diagnosed during the open-label trial. All of these observed cases occurred outside the United States, and none of the patients had extrapulmonary manifestations.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Liver Injury</span></p><p>There have been reports of elevations of transaminase and/or bilirubin in patients receiving ENTYVIO <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>. In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, three patients reported serious adverse reactions of hepatitis, manifested as elevated transaminases with or without elevated bilirubin and symptoms consistent with hepatitis (e.g., malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia). These adverse reactions occurred following two to five ENTYVIO doses; however, based on case report information it is unclear if the reactions indicated drug-induced or autoimmune etiology. All patients recovered following discontinuation of therapy with some requiring corticosteroid treatment. In controlled trials, the incidence of ALT and AST elevations ≥3× ULN was &lt;2% in patients treated with ENTYVIO and in patients treated with placebo. In the open-label trial, one additional case of serious hepatitis was observed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Malignancies</span></p><p>In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, malignancies (excluding dysplasia and basal cell carcinoma) were reported in six of 1,434 (0.4%) patients treated with ENTYVIO, including colon cancer (n=2), transitional cell carcinoma (n=1), breast cancer (n=1), carcinoid tumor of the appendix (n=1) and squamous cell carcinoma (n=1). Malignancy was reported in one of 297 (0.3%) patients treated with placebo (squamous cell carcinoma).</p><p>Malignancies (excluding dysplasia and basal cell carcinoma) observed during the ongoing open-label long-term extension trial included B-cell lymphoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, malignant hepatic neoplasm, malignant lung neoplasm, malignant melanoma, lung cancer of primary neuroendocrine carcinoma, renal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma. Overall, the number of malignancies in the clinical trials was small; however, long-term exposure was limited.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Live and Oral Vaccines</span></p><p>There are no data on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving ENTYVIO.</p><p>In a placebo-controlled study of healthy volunteers, 61 subjects were given a single ENTYVIO 750 mg dose (2.5 times the recommended dose), and 62 subjects received placebo followed by intramuscular vaccination with Hepatitis B surface antigen and oral cholera vaccine. After intramuscular vaccination with three doses of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen, those treated with ENTYVIO did not have lower rates of protective immunity to Hepatitis B virus. However, those exposed to ENTYVIO did have lower seroconversion rates and anti-cholera titers relative to placebo after receiving the two doses of a killed, oral cholera vaccine. The impact on other oral vaccines and on nasal vaccines in patients is unknown.</p><h3>Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to vedolizumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.</p><p>In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, in patients who received ENTYVIO, the frequency of antibodies detected in patients was 13% at 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug (greater than five half-lives after last dose). During treatment, 56 of 1,434 (4%) of patients treated with ENTYVIO had detectable anti-vedolizumab antibody at any time during the 52 weeks of continuous treatment. Nine of 56 patients were persistently positive (at two or more study visits) for anti-vedolizumab antibody and 33 of 56 patients developed neutralizing antibodies to vedolizumab. Among eight of these nine subjects with persistently positive anti-vedolizumab antibody and available vedolizumab concentration data, six had undetectable and two had reduced vedolizumab concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. None of the nine subjects with persistently positive anti-vedolizumab antibody achieved clinical remission at Weeks 6 or 52 in the controlled trials.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ENTYVIO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune system disorders:</span> Anaphylaxis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Natalizumab</h3><p class="First">Because of the potential for increased risk of PML and other infections, avoid the concomitant use of ENTYVIO with natalizumab.</p><h3>TNF Blockers</h3><p class="First">Because of the potential for increased risk of infections, avoid the concomitant use of ENTYVIO with TNF blockers.</p><h3>Live Vaccines</h3><p class="First">Live vaccines may be administered concurrently with ENTYVIO only if the benefits outweigh the risks <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Exposure Registry</span></p><p>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ENTYVIO during pregnancy. Information about the registry can be obtained by calling 1-877-TAKEDA7 (1-877-825-3327).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available pharmacovigilance data, data from the ongoing pregnancy registry, and data from published case reports and cohort studies in pregnant women have not identified an ENTYVIO associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with inflammatory bowel disease in pregnancy <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</span>. No fetal harm was observed in animal reproduction studies with intravenous administration of vedolizumab to rabbits and monkeys at dose levels 20 times the recommended human dosage <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and miscarriage is 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk</span></p><p>Published data suggest that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased disease activity. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions</span></p><p>ENTYVIO administered during pregnancy could affect immune responses in the <span class="Italics">in utero</span> exposed newborn and infant. The clinical significance of low levels of ENTYVIO <span class="Italics">in utero</span>-exposed infants is unknown. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in exposed infants is unknown.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>A reproduction study has been performed in pregnant rabbits at single intravenous doses up to 100 mg/kg administered on gestation Day 7 (about 20 times the recommended human dosage) and has revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to vedolizumab. A pre- and post-natal development study in monkeys showed no evidence of any adverse effect on pre- and post-natal development at intravenous doses up to 100 mg/kg (about 20 times the recommended human dosage).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available published literature suggests the presence of vedolizumab in human milk. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and expected low systemic exposure to vedolizumab on the breastfed infant are unknown. There are no data on the effects of vedolizumab on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ENTYVIO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ENTYVIO or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of ENTYVIO in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of ENTYVIO did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over (46 Crohn's and ulcerative colitis patients aged 65 and over were treated with ENTYVIO during controlled Phase 3 trials) to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>Entyvio Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Vedolizumab, an integrin receptor antagonist, is a humanized IgG<span class="Sub">1</span> monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells that binds to the human α4β7 integrin. ENTYVIO has an approximate molecular weight of 147 kilodaltons.</p><p>ENTYVIO (vedolizumab) for injection is supplied as a sterile, white to off-white, preservative-free, lyophilized cake for intravenous infusion. After reconstitution with 4.8 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the final concentration is 60 mg/mL with a deliverable volume of 5 mL (300 mg) and the resulting pH is approximately 6.3.</p><p>Each single-dose vial contains 300 mg vedolizumab, L-arginine hydrochloride (131.7 mg), L-histidine (23 mg), L-histidine monohydrochloride (21.4 mg), polysorbate 80 (3 mg), and sucrose (500 mg).</p><h2>Entyvio Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the α4β7 integrin and blocks the interaction of α4β7 integrin with mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) and inhibits the migration of memory T-lymphocytes across the endothelium into inflamed gastrointestinal parenchymal tissue. Vedolizumab does not bind to or inhibit function of the α4β1 and αEβ7 integrins and does not antagonize the interaction of α4 integrins with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).</p><p>The α4β7 integrin is expressed on the surface of a discrete subset of memory T-lymphocytes that preferentially migrate into the gastrointestinal tract. MAdCAM-1 is mainly expressed on gut endothelial cells and plays a critical role in the homing of T-lymphocytes to gut lymph tissue. The interaction of the α4β7 integrin with MAdCAM-1 has been implicated as an important contributor to the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials with ENTYVIO at doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg (which includes doses outside of the recommended dose), saturation of α4β7 receptors on subsets of circulating lymphocytes involved in gut-immune surveillance was observed.</p><p>In clinical trials with ENTYVIO at doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg and 180 to 750 mg (which include doses outside of the recommended dose) in healthy subjects and in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, vedolizumab did not elevate neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, B-helper and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, total memory helper T-lymphocytes, monocytes or natural killer cells.</p><p>A reduction in gastrointestinal inflammation was observed in rectal biopsy specimens from Phase 2 ulcerative colitis patients exposed to ENTYVIO for four or six weeks compared to placebo control as assessed by histopathology.</p><p>In a study of 14 healthy subjects, ENTYVIO did not affect the CD4+ lymphocyte cell counts, CD8+ lymphocyte cell counts, or the CD4+:CD8+ ratios in the CSF <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Similar pharmacokinetics were observed in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients administered 300 mg ENTYVIO as a 30 minute intravenous infusion on Weeks 0 and 2, followed by 300 mg ENTYVIO every eight weeks starting from Week 6 <span class="Italics">(Table 3)</span>.</p><p>The presence of persistent anti-vedolizumab antibody was observed to substantially reduce serum concentrations of vedolizumab, either to undetectable or negligible levels at Weeks 6 and 52 (n=8).</p><p>Vedolizumab clearance depends on both linear and nonlinear pathways; the nonlinear clearance decreases with increasing concentrations. Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the linear clearance was approximately 0.157 L/day, the serum half-life was approximately 25 days at 300 mg dosage, and the distribution volume was approximately 5 L.</p><p>Vedolizumab was not detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 14 healthy subjects at five weeks after a single intravenous administration of 450 mg ENTYVIO (1.5 times the recommended dosage).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Special Populations</span></p><p>Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the severity of disease state, body weight, prior treatment with TNF blocker therapy, age (18 to 78 years), serum albumin, coadministered immunomodulators (including azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate), and coadministered aminosalicylates did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of ENTYVIO.</p><p>Pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency have not been studied.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of vedolizumab. Studies to evaluate the possible impairment of fertility or mutagenic potential of vedolizumab have not been performed.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Clinical Studies in Ulcerative Colitis</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of ENTYVIO were evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (UC Trials I and II) in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) defined as Mayo score of six to 12 with endoscopy subscore of two or three. The Mayo score ranges from zero to 12 and has four subscales that are each scored from zero (normal) to three (most severe): stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on endoscopy, and physician global assessment.
