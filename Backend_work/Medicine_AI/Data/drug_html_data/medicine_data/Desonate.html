It prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation.</p><p>Desonate gel is used to treat mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in patients 3 months of age and older. Treatment should continue for the minimum amount of time as necessary to achieve the desired results.</p><p>Treatment with Desonate gel should not exceed 4 consecutive weeks.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Use Desonate gel exactly as directed on the label, or as it has been prescribed by your doctor. Do not use this medicine in larger amounts or for longer than recommended. Topical steroid medicine can be absorbed through the skin, which may cause steroid side effects throughout the body.</p><p>Do not cover treated skin areas with a bandage or other covering unless your doctor has told you to. If you are treating the diaper area of a baby, do not use plastic pants or tight-fitting diapers. Covering the skin that is treated with Desonate can increase the amount of medicine your skin absorbs, which may lead to unwanted side effects. Follow your doctor's instructions. Do not use Desonate on a child without a doctor's advice. Children are more likely to absorb large amounts of a topical steroid through the skin. Steroid absorption in children may cause unwanted side effects, or a delay in growth with long-term use. Talk with your doctor if you think your child is not growing at a normal rate while using Desonate over a long treatment period.</p><p>Contact your doctor if your condition does not improve after 2 weeks of using this medicine, or if you develop signs of a bacterial, fungal, or viral skin infection.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Desonate gel if you are allergic to desonide.</p><p>To make sure Desonate is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>any type of skin infection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>diabetes; or</p>
</li>

If you apply Desonate gel to your chest, avoid areas that may come into contact with the baby's mouth.</p><p>Only apply this medicine to a child under medical supervision.</p><p>Children can absorb larger amounts of this medicine through the skin and may be more likely to have side effects.</p><h2>How should I use Desonate?</h2><p>Desonate gel is usually applied 2 times a day.

Do not apply Desonate gel over a large area of skin unless your doctor has told you to.</p><p>Do not cover the treated skin area with a bandage or other covering unless your doctor tells you to. Covering treated areas can increase the amount of medicine absorbed through your skin and may cause harmful effects.</p><p>Desonate gel should NOT be used for the treatment of diaper dermatitis and the gel should not be applied in the diaper area, as diapers or plastic pants may also increase the amount of desonide absorbed and cause adverse effects.</p><p>This medicine is for short-term use only (such as 2 to 4 weeks).
