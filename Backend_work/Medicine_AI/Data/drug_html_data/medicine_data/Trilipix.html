High levels of these types of fat in the blood are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis (clogged arteries).</p><p>Trilipix is used to treat high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels.</p><p>Trilipix is sometimes given together with other cholesterol-lowering medications.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not take Trilipix if you have liver disease, gallbladder disease, severe kidney disease, or if you are breastfeeding a baby.</p><p>In rare cases, Trilipix can cause a condition that results in the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, leading to kidney failure. Call your doctor right away if you have unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness especially if you also have fever, unusual tiredness, or dark colored urine.</p><p>Before you take this medicine, tell your doctor if you have kidney disease, diabetes, or underactive thyroid.</p><p>Trilipix is only part of a complete program of treatment that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, and other medications.
