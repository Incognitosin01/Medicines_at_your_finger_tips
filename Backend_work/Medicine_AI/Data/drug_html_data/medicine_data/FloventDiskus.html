Talk with your doctor about your risk.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant. It is not known whether fluticasone will harm an unborn baby. However, having untreated or uncontrolled asthma during pregnancy may cause complications such as low birth weight, premature birth, or eclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure that can lead to medical problems in both mother and baby). The benefit of treating asthma may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><p>Do not give this medicine to a child without medical advice.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use  Flovent Diskus?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed. Do not use the medicine more often than prescribed.</p><p><b>Flovent Diskus is not a rescue medicine for asthma attacks.</b> Use only fast-acting inhalation medicine for an attack. Seek medical attention if your breathing problems get worse quickly, or if you think your asthma medications are not working as well.</p><p>Flovent is a liquid form of fluticasone used with an inhaler device. This device creates a spray that you inhale through your mouth and into your lungs.</p><p>Flovent Diskus, ArmonAir, and Arnuity Ellipta are powder forms of fluticasone that come with a special inhaler device preloaded with blister packs containing measured doses of fluticasone. The device opens and loads a blister of fluticasone each time you use the inhaler.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Do not allow a young child to use this medicine without help from an adult.</p><p>Your dose needs may change if you have surgery, are ill, are under stress, or have recently had an asthma attack. Do not change your medication dose or stop using fluticasone without your doctor's advice.</p><p>To reduce the chance of developing a yeast infection in your mouth, rinse with water (but do not swallow) after using this medicine. Pay special attention to your dental hygiene. Fluticasone can cause cavities or tooth discoloration.</p><p>If you also use an oral steroid medication, you should not stop using it suddenly. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.</p><p>In case of emergency, wear or carry medical identification to let others know you may need an oral steroid in an emergency.</p><p>Your doctor will need to check your progress on a regular basis. Your vision may also need to be checked at regular intervals.</p><p>Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve after 2 weeks of treatment, or if symptoms get worse. If you use a peak flow meter at home, call your doctor if your numbers are lower than normal.</p><p>You should not stop using Flovent Diskus suddenly. Stopping suddenly may make your condition worse.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, light, and extreme heat or cold.</p><p>Store the powder forms in the unopened foil pouch or tray until ready to use. Throw away any unused medicine when the inhalations counter on your inhaler device shows "0." Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely.</p><p>Store the <b>Flovent HFA</b> canister with the mouthpiece down. Keep the canister away from open flame or high heat, such as in a car on a hot day. The canister may explode if it gets too hot. Do not puncture or burn an empty inhaler canister.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Skip the missed dose and use your next dose at the regular time. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><p>If you use Arnuity Ellipta, do not use more than 1 inhalation per day.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>An overdose of fluticasone is not expected to produce life threatening symptoms. Long term use of an inhaled steroid can lead to glaucoma, cataracts, thinning skin, changes in body fat (especially in your face, neck, back, and waist), increased acne or facial hair, menstrual problems, impotence, or loss of interest in sex.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using  Flovent Diskus?</h2><p>Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections.
