BLOOD COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR SYSTEMS CONTAINING A Y SAMPLING SITE (YSS) ONLY</h2><p class="First">1. Load blood agitation device or suspend blood bag on donor scale and adjust donor scale to desired collection gross weight as per manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>2. Clamp donor tubing between the Donor <span class="Italics">Care</span>® Needle Guard (DCNG) and Y Sampling Site.</p><p>3. Secure donor tubing above the Y connector and disinfect site of phlebotomy.</p><p>4. If using blood pressure cuff, inflate to not more than 60 mm Hg.</p><p>5. Remove donor needle cover and accomplish phlebotomy.</p><p>6. Release clamp and ensure there is blood flow. Reduce pressure as required.</p><p>7. Slide the DCNG midway over the needle hub and securely tape DCNG to the donor's arm as close to the top of the DCNG as possible. <span class="Bold">Note:</span> If blood flow is slow, slide DCNG away from the needle hub, adjust and re-engage DCNG. If repeated needle adjustment is necessary, slide DCNG away from the needle hub and re-engage at the end of blood collection.</p><p>8. Collect appropriate volume of blood into collection bag, as indicated on packaging.</p><p><span class="Bold">Note:</span> Mix blood and anticoagulant frequently during collection, for example, once every 45 seconds, and immediately after collection. If blood agitation device is used, follow manufacturer's operating instructions.</p><p>9. After required amount of blood has been collected, seal donor tubing between Y Sampling Site and the collection bag.*</p><p>10. For blood sampling, remove the Y Sampling Site needle cover. Ensure the protective sheath is in place over the sampling needle.</p><p>11. Fasten the vacuum tube holder on to the base of the sampling needle.</p><p>12. Collect blood samples into vacuum tubes.</p><p>13. Ensure the vacuum tubes are centered within the vacuum tube holder during sample collection.</p><p>14. Maintain forward pressure on the vacuum tubes during sample collection.</p><p><span class="Bold">Note:</span> After the last tube is collected, it is recommended that the vacuum tube holder be left in place.</p><p>15. After blood samples are collected, clamp donor tubing between the Y Sampling Site and DCNG, as close as possible to the DCNG.</p><p>16. Release any remaining pressure from the donor's arm.</p><p>17. DCNG must be held stationary while the needle is withdrawn into it. While holding sides of DCNG near the front, grasp the tubing below the clamp and pull the needle into the DCNG until it locks into place, and the needle hub engages the bottom of the DCNG.</p><p>18. Insert the DCNG into the vacuum tube holder. <span class="Bold">Note:</span> It is recommended that the DCNG be inserted securely into the vacuum tube holder prior to discarding.</p><p>19. Seal donor tubing adjacent to DCNG.* Detach and discard needle, DCNG, Y Sampling Site and tubing.*</p><p>20. Strip tubing between seal and collection bag.</p><p>21.
