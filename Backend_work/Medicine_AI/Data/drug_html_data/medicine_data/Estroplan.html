<span class="Bold">Estroplan</span> (cloprostenol sodium) injection is a synthetic prostaglandin analogue structurally related to prostaglandin F<span class="Sub">2</span><span class="Sub">α</span> (PGF<span class="Sub">2</span><span class="Sub">α</span>). Each mL of the colorless aqueous solution contains 263 mcg of cloprostenol sodium (equivalent to 250 mcg of cloprostenol), chlorocresol 1.0 mg as a bactericide, citric acid anhydrous 0.66 mg, sodium citrate 5.03 mg, sodium chloride 6.76 mg. The pH is adjusted, as necessary, with sodium hydroxide or citric acid.</p><p><span class="Bold">ACTION:</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Estroplan</span> injection causes functional and morphological regression of the corpus luteum (luteolysis) in cattle. In normal, nonpregnant cycling animals this effect on the life span of the corpus luteum usually results in estrus 2 to 5 days after treatment. In animals with prolonged luteal function (pyometra, mummified fetus, and luteal cysts) the induced luteolysis usually results in resolution of the condition and return to cyclicity. Pregnant animals may abort depending on the stage of gestation.</p><p><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS:</span><br/>
For intramuscular use to induce luteolysis in beef and dairy cattle. The luteolytic action of <span class="Bold">Estroplan</span> injection can be utilized to manipulate the estrous cycle to better fit certain management practices, to terminate pregnancies resulting from mismatings and to treat certain conditions associated with prolonged luteal function.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">RECOMMENDED USES:</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Unobserved or Non-detected Estrus<br/></span> Cows which are not detected in estrus, although ovarian cyclicity continues, can be treated with <span class="Bold">Estroplan</span> if a mature corpus luteum is present. Estrus is expected to occur 2 to 5 days following injection, at which time animals may be inseminated. Treated cattle should be inseminated at the usual time following detection of estrus. If estrus detection is not desirable or possible, treated animals may be inseminated twice at about 72 and 96 hours post injection.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Pyometra Or Chronic Endometritis<br/></span> Damage to the reproductive tract at calving or post partum retention of the placenta often leads to infection and inflammation of the uterus (endometritis). Under certain circumstances, this may progress into chronic endometritis with the uterus becoming distended with purulent matter. This condition, commonly referred to as pyometra, is characterized by a lack of cyclical estrus behavior and the presence of a persistent corpus luteum. Induction of luteolysis with <span class="Bold">Estroplan</span> usually results in evacuation of the uterus and a return to normal cyclical activity within 14 days after treatment. After 14 days post treatment, recovery rate of treated animals will not be different than that of untreated cattle.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Mummified Fetus<br/></span> Death of the conceptus during gestation may be followed by its degeneration and dehydration. Induction of luteolysis with <span class="Bold">Estroplan</span> usually results in expulsion of the mummified fetus from the uterus. (Manual assistance may be necessary to remove the fetus from the vagina.) Normal cyclical activity usually follows.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Luteal Cysts<br/></span> A cow may be noncyclic due to the presence of a luteal cyst (a single, anovulatory follicle with a thickened wall which is accompanied by no external signs and by no changes in palpable consistency of the uterus). Treatment with <span class="Bold">Estroplan</span> can restore normal ovarian activity by causing regression of the luteal cyst.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancies From Mismating<br/></span> Unwanted pregnancies can be safely and efficiently terminated from 1 week after mating until about five months of gestation. The induced abortion is normally uncomplicated and the fetus and placenta are usually expelled about four to five days after the injection with the reproductive tract returning to normal soon after the abortion. The ability of <span class="Bold">Estroplan</span> to induce abortion decreases beyond the fifth month of gestation while the risk of dystocia and its consequences increases. <span class="Bold">Estroplan</span> has not been sufficiently tested under feedlot conditions; therefore recommendations cannot be made for its use in heifers placed in feedlots.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">1. Single Estroplan Injection</span></p><p>Only animals with a mature corpus luteum should be treated to obtain maximum response to the single injection. However, not all cycling cattle should be treated since a mature corpus luteum is present for only 11 to 12 days of the 21-day cycle.<br/></p><p>Prior to treatment, cattle should be examined rectally and found to be anatomically normal, be non-pregnant and have a mature corpus luteum. If these criteria are met, estrus is expected to occur two to five days following injection, at which time animals may be inseminated. Treated cattle should be inseminated at the usual time following detection of estrus. If estrus detection is not desirable or possible, treated animals may be inseminated either once at about 72 hours or twice at about 72 and 96 hours post injection.<br/></p><p>With a single injection program, it may be desirable to assess the cyclicity status of the herd before <span class="Bold">Estroplan</span> treatment. This can be accomplished by heat detecting and breeding at the usual time following detection of estrus for a 6-day period, all prior to injection. If by the sixth day the cyclicity status appears normal (approximately 25 - 30% detected in estrus), all cattle not already inseminated should be palpated for normality, non-pregnancy, and cyclicity, then injected with <span class="Bold">Estroplan</span>. Breeding should then be continued at the usual time following signs of estrus on the seventh and eighth day. On the ninth and tenth day breeding may continue at the usual time following detection of estrus or all cattle not already inseminated may be bred either once on the ninth day (at about 72 hours post injection) or on both the ninth and tenth day (at about 72 and 96 hours post injection).</p><p><span class="Bold">2. Double Estroplan Injections</span></p><p>Prior to treatment, cattle should be examined rectally and found to be anatomically normal, non-pregnant, and cycling (the presence of a mature corpus luteum is not necessary when the first injection of a double injection regimen is given). A second injection should be given 11 days after the first injection. In normal, cycling cattle, estrus is expected 2 to 5 days following the second injection. Treated cattle should be inseminated at the usual time following detection of estrus. If estrus detection is not desirable or possible, treated animals may be inseminated either once at about 72 hours or twice at about 72 and 96 hours following the second <span class="Bold">Estroplan</span> injection.<br/></p><p>Many animals will come into estrus following the first injection; these animals can be inseminated at the usual time following detected estrus. Animals not inseminated should receive a second injection 11 days after the first injection. Animals receiving both injections may be inseminated at the usual time following detection of estrus or may be inseminated either once at about 72 hours or twice at about 72 and 96 hours post second injection.<br/></p><p>Any controlled breeding program recommended should be completed by either:<br/></p><p>REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTROLLED BREEDING PROGRAMS:</p><p>A variety of programs can be designed to best meet the needs of individual management systems. A controlled breeding program should be selected which is appropriate for the existing circumstances and management practices.<br/></p><p>Before a controlled breeding program is planned the producer’s objectives must be examined and he must be made aware of the projected results and limitations. The producer and his consulting veterinarian should review the operation’s breeding history, herd health and nutritional status and agree that a controlled breeding program is practical in the producer’s specific situation. For any successful controlled breeding program:</p><p>- cows and heifers must be normal, nonpregnant, and cycling (rectal palpation should be performed).<br/>
- cattle must be in a fit and thrifty breeding condition and on an adequate or increasing plane of nutrition.<br/>
- proper program planning and record keeping are essential.<br/>
- if artificial insemination is being used it must be performed by competent inseminators using high quality semen.<br/></p><p>It is important to understand that Estroplan is effective only in animals with a mature corpus luteum (ovulation must have occurred at least 5 days prior to treatment). This must be considered when breeding is intended following a single <span class="Bold">Estroplan</span> injection.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">SAFETY AND TOXICITY:</span><br/>
At 50 and 100 times the recommended dose, mild side effects may be detected in some cattle. These include increased uneasiness, slight frothing, and milk let-down.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS:</span><br/>
Estroplan should not be administered to a pregnant animal whose calf is not to be aborted.</p><p><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span><br/>
For animal use only.<br/>
Women of child-bearing age, asthmatics, and persons with bronchial and other respiratory problems should exercise extreme caution when handling this product. In the early stages women may be unaware of their pregnancies.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Estroplan</span> injection is readily absorbed through the skin and may cause abortion and/or bronchospasms: direct contact with the skin should therefore be avoided. Accidental spillage on the skin should be washed off immediately with soap and water.</p><p><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span><br/>
There is no effect on fertility following the single or double dosage regimen when breeding occurs at induced estrus or at 72 and 96 hours post treatment. Conception rates may be lower than expected in those fixed time breeding programs which omit the second insemination (i.e. the insemination at or near 96 hours). This is especially true if a fixed time insemination is used following a single <span class="Bold">Estroplan</span> injection.<br/>
As with all parenteral products, careful aseptic techniques should be employed to decrease the possibility of post injection bacterial infection. Antibiotic therapy should be employed at the first sign of infection.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</span><br/>
2mL of <span class="Bold">Estroplan</span> injection (500 mcg of cloprostenol) should be administered by INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION for all indications in both beef and dairy cattle.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">STORAGE CONDITIONS:</span><br/>
