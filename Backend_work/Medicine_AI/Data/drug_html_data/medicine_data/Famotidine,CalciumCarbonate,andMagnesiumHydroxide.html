Management: Coadministration of selpercatinib and antacids should be avoided. If coadministration cannot be avoided, selpercatinib should be administered 2 hours before or 2 hours after antacids.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate: Laxatives (Magnesium Containing) may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate. More specifically, concomitant use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate with magnesium-containing laxatives may result in metabolic alkalosis or with sorbitol may result in intestinal necrosis.  Management: Avoid concomitant use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate (rectal or oral) and magnesium-containing laxatives.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Sotalol: Antacids may decrease the serum concentration of Sotalol.  Management: Avoid simultaneous administration of sotalol and antacids. Administer antacids 2 hours after sotalol.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Strontium Ranelate: Magnesium Hydroxide may decrease the serum concentration of Strontium Ranelate.  Management: Separate administration of strontium ranelate and magnesium hydroxide by at least 2 hours whenever possible in order to minimize this interaction.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Sulpiride: Antacids may decrease the serum concentration of Sulpiride.  Management: Separate administration of antacids and sulpiride by at least 2 hours in order to minimize the impact of antacids on sulpiride absorption.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Tacrolimus (Systemic): Magnesium Hydroxide may increase the serum concentration of Tacrolimus (Systemic). Magnesium Hydroxide may decrease the serum concentration of Tacrolimus (Systemic). Specifically, maximum concentration may decrease. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Tafenoquine: May increase the serum concentration of OCT2 Substrates. Management: Avoid use of OCT2 substrates with tafenoquine, and if the combination cannot be avoided, monitor closely for evidence of toxicity of the OCT2 substrate and consider a reduced dose of the OCT2 substrate according to that substrate's labeling.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Tetracyclines: Antacids may decrease the absorption of Tetracyclines.  Management: Separate administration of antacids and oral tetracycline derivatives by several hours when possible to minimize the extent of this potential interaction. Monitor for decreased therapeuctic effects of tetracyclines.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Tetracyclines: Magnesium Salts may decrease the absorption of Tetracyclines. Only applicable to oral preparations of each agent.  Management: Avoid coadministration of oral magnesium salts and oral tetracyclines. If coadministration cannot be avoided, administer oral magnesium at least 2 hours before, or 4 hours after, oral tetracyclines. Monitor for decreased tetracycline therapeutic effects.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Tetracyclines: Calcium Salts may decrease the serum concentration of Tetracyclines.  Management: If coadministration of oral calcium with oral tetracyclines cannot be avoided, consider separating administration of each agent by several hours.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Thiazide and Thiazide-Like Diuretics: May decrease the excretion of Calcium Salts. Continued concomitant use can also result in metabolic alkalosis.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Thyroid Products: Calcium Salts may diminish the therapeutic effect of Thyroid Products.  Management: Separate the doses of the thyroid product and the oral calcium supplement by at least 4 hours. Monitor for decreased therapeutic effects of thyroid products if an oral calcium supplement is initiated/dose increased.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Trientine: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of Trientine.  Management: Avoid concomitant administration of trientine and oral products that contain polyvalent cations. If oral iron supplements are required, separate the administration by 2 hours. If other oral polyvalent cations are needed, separate administration by 1 hour.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Varenicline: Histamine H2 Receptor Antagonists may increase the serum concentration of Varenicline.  Management: Monitor for increased varenicline adverse effects with concomitant use of cimetidine or other H2-antagonists, particularly in patients with severe renal impairment. International product labeling recommendations vary. Consult appropriate labeling.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Velpatasvir: Antacids may decrease the serum concentration of Velpatasvir.  Management: Separate administration of velpatasvir and antacids by at least 4 hours.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Vitamin D Analogs: Calcium Salts may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Vitamin D Analogs. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>See individual agents.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Phenylalanine: Some products may contain phenylalanine.</p><p>• Tartrazine: Some products may contain tartrazine.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Self-medication (OTC use): When used for self-medication, patients should be instructed to consult their healthcare prescriber prior to using if they have had heartburn &gt;3 months; heartburn with dizziness; heartburn or chest pain with lightheadedness or sweating; chest pain or shoulder pain with shortness of breath; frequent chest pain; chest or shoulder pain spreading to arms, neck, or shoulders; frequent wheezing associated with heartburn; unexplained weight loss; nausea or vomiting; or stomach pain.
