Vaccination provides protective antibodies in &gt;95% of infants who are vaccinated with a 2- or 3-dose series (CDC 2012). An anti-PRP concentration of ≥1.0 mcg/mL predicts long-term protection.</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>Immunity develops progressively with each dose.  Immunity can be inferred ~ 2 weeks after the initial series is complete.</p><p>Efficacy: The initial unconjugated polysaccharide Hib vaccines produced 45% to 88% reduction in disease incidence among children at least 18 to 24 months of age. The initial protein-conjugated Hib vaccines produced &gt;90% protection in infants after a multidose series. After the initial Hib conjugate vaccines were licensed, subsequent formulations were licensed based on noninferior antibody responses.</p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>Antibody concentrations exceeding 0.15 mcg/mL correlate with clinical protection from disease. Antibody concentrations exceeding 1 mcg/mL correlate with prolonged protection from disease, generally implying several years of protection.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease caused by <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type b (Hib):</b></p><p>ActHIB: Immunization of infants and children 2 months to 5 years of age.</p><p>Hiberix: Immunization of infants and children 6 weeks to 4 years of age (prior to fifth birthday).</p><p>PedvaxHIB: Routine vaccination of infants and children 2 to 71 months of age. </p><p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends vaccination for the following (CDC/ACIP [Briere 2014]):</p><p>- Routine immunization of all infants and children through age 59 months</p><p>- Unimmunized (defined as those who have not received a primary series and booster dose or at least 1 dose of a Hib vaccine after 14 months of age) children 12 to 59 months including chemotherapy recipients, anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease), HIV infection, immunoglobulin deficiency or early component complement deficiency</p><p>Efficacy data are not available for use in older children and adults with chronic conditions associated with an increased risk of Hib disease.

Withdraw entire contents of vial (~0.5 mL) for administration. Shake well prior to use.</p><p>PedvaxHIB: Used as supplied; no reconstitution is necessary. Shake well; thorough agitation is necessary to maintain suspension of the vaccine.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IM: For IM administration; do not inject IV, intradermally, or subcutaneously. Shake well prior to use. Administer into the anterolateral thigh or deltoid. Do not administer into buttocks due to potential risk of injury to sciatic nerve. Do not mix with other vaccines or injections; separate needles and syringes should be used for each injection. To prevent syncope related injuries, patients should be vaccinated while seated or lying down (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). US law requires that the date of administration, the vaccine manufacturer, lot number of vaccine, Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) edition date and date it was provided, and the administering person's name, title, and address be recorded.</p><p>ActHIB, PedvaxHIB: If the primary series is delayed or interrupted, there is no need to start the series over, regardless of the interval between doses.</p><p>Hiberix: If Hiberix is inadvertently administered during the primary vaccination series, the dose can be counted as a valid PRP-T dose that does not need to be repeated if administered according to schedule. In this case, a total of 3 doses completes the primary series (CDC 58[36] 2009).</p><p>For patients at risk of hemorrhage following intramuscular injection, the vaccine should be administered intramuscularly if, in the opinion of the physician familiar with the patient's bleeding risk, the vaccine can be administered by this route with reasonable safety. If the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, intramuscular vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered. A fine needle (23 gauge or smaller) can be used for the vaccination and firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. The patient should be instructed concerning the risk of hematoma from the injection. Patients on anticoagulant therapy should be considered to have the same bleeding risks and treated as those with clotting factor disorders (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>ActHIB: Store lyophilized powder and diluent under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F); do not freeze.

Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever); vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with a history of bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia); bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; if the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM injection can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS): ActHIB, Hiberix: Use with caution in patients with history of GBS; carefully consider risks and benefits to vaccination in patients known to have experienced GBS within 6 weeks following previous tetanus-containing vaccination.</p><p>• Tetanus immunization: Immunization with ActHIB or Hiberix does not substitute for routine tetanus immunization.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Anticoagulant therapy: Use with caution in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy; bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist. The use of combination vaccines is generally preferred over separate injections, taking into consideration provider assessment, patient preference, and adverse events. When using combination vaccines, the minimum age for administration is the oldest minimum age for any individual component; the minimum interval between dosing is the greatest minimum interval between any individual components. The ACIP prefers each dose of Hib containing combination vaccines in a series come from the same manufacturer when possible; however, vaccination should not be deferred because a specific brand name is unavailable. According to the ACIP, monovalent Hib vaccines are interchangeable; however, if different brands are used in the primary series and the number of doses required for series completion varies, then the higher number of doses is recommended for series completion (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Consider deferring immunization during periods of severe immunosuppression (eg, patients receiving chemo/radiation therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy [including high-dose corticosteroids]); may have a reduced response to vaccination (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). In general, household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive all age appropriate vaccines). Inactivated vaccines should be administered ≥2 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression when feasible; inactivated vaccines administered during chemotherapy should be readministered after immune competence is regained (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p>• Pediatric: Apnea has occurred following intramuscular vaccine administration in premature infants; consider clinical status implications. In general, preterm infants should be vaccinated at the same chronological age as full-term infants (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Lactose: Some products may contain lactose.</p><p>• Latex: Packaging may contain natural latex rubber.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Antipyretics: Antipyretics have not been shown to prevent febrile seizures; antipyretics may be used to treat fever or discomfort following vaccination (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). One study reported that routine prophylactic administration of acetaminophen to prevent fever prior to vaccination decreased the immune response of some vaccines; the clinical significance of this reduction in immune response has not been established (Prymula 2009).</p><p>• Appropriate use: Use of this vaccine for specific medical and/or other indications (eg, immunocompromising conditions, hepatic or kidney disease, diabetes) is also addressed in the annual ACIP Recommended Immunization Schedules (refer to CDC schedule for detailed information). Specific recommendations for vaccination in immunocompromised patients with asplenia, cancer, HIV infection, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, cochlear implants, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (prior to or after), sickle cell disease, solid organ transplant (prior to or after), or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for chronic conditions are available from the IDSA (Rubin 2014).</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). Infection may occur within the week of vaccination, prior to the onset of the vaccine.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor for anaphylaxis and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted. Inactivated vaccines have not been shown to cause increased risks to the fetus (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to prevent <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type b disease.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
