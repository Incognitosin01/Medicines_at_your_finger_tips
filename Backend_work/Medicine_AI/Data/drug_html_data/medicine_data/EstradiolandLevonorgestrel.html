Estradiol is the principle intracellular human estrogen and is more potent than estrone and estriol at the receptor level; it is the primary estrogen secreted prior to menopause. Following menopause, estrone and estrone sulfate are more highly produced. Estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone through a negative feedback system; estrogen replacement reduces elevated levels of these hormones in postmenopausal women. </p><p>Levonorgestrel inhibits gonadotropin production; when used in this combination, it counteracts the proliferative effects of estradiol on the endometrium.</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Serum: Topical: Estradiol (mean): 2-2.5 days; Levonorgestrel: 2.5 days</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Estradiol: 3 ± 0.67 hours; Levonorgestrel: 28 ± 6.4 hours</p><h2>Special Populations: Renal Function Impairment</h2><p>Total estradiol serum concentrations may be excessive in women with end stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis.</p><h2>Special Populations: Hepatic Function Impairment</h2><p>Estrogens are poorly metabolized in women with hepatic dysfunction.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms:</b> Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in women with an intact uterus</p><p><b>Osteoporosis prevention:</b> Prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women with an intact uterus</p><p>Limitations of use: Osteoporosis: For use only in women at significant risk of osteoporosis and for whom other nonestrogen medications are not considered appropriate</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, or hypersensitivity to estradiol, levonorgestrel, or any component of the formulation; undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding; DVT or PE (current or history of); active or history of arterial thromboembolic disease (eg, stroke, MI); breast cancer (known, suspected or history of); estrogen-dependent tumor (known or suspected); hepatic impairment or disease; known protein C, protein S, antithrombin deficiency or other known thrombophilic disorders; pregnancy</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Progestin-dependent neoplasia (known or suspected); endometrial hyperplasia; breastfeeding; classical migraine; partial or complete loss of vision due to ophthalmic vascular disease</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><i><b>General dosing guidelines:</b></i> When treating symptoms of menopause, hormone therapy should be evaluated routinely for appropriate dose, duration, and route of administration for each individual patient based on treatment goals, risk factors, and overall health (NAMS 2017). Combined estrogen/progestin therapy is indicated for postmenopausal persons with a uterus to decrease the risk of endometrial cancer. Individuals who have had a hysterectomy generally do not need a progestin; however, one may be needed if there is a history of endometriosis. Adjust dose based on patient response.</p><p><b>Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause or prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis:</b> Adult females with an intact uterus: Transdermal: Estradiol 0.045 mg/levonorgestrel 0.015 mg: Apply one patch weekly. When used for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, evaluate to see if therapy is still needed/attempt to discontinue every 3 to 6 months.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Women &gt;65 years of age should be assessed for benefits and risks of treatment; possible adjustments to safer lower-dose and/or route of administration should be considered (ACOG 565 2013; NAMS 2017). The Beers Criteria recommends avoiding systemic estrogen therapy in patients ≥65 years of age (independent of diagnosis or condition) (Beers Criteria [AGS 2019]).</p><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Transdermal patch: When initiating therapy, women not using a continuous estrogen or estrogen plus progestin may apply the patch at any time. Women already on hormonal therapy should complete their current cycle prior to initiating the patch. If bleeding occurs when the cycle is completed with the previous therapy, the first day of bleeding is an appropriate time to initiate the patch.</p><p>The patch should be applied immediately after taking out of pouch and removing the protective lining. Apply the adhesive side of the patch once weekly to a clean, dry, fold-free area of the lower abdomen or upper quadrant of buttock; avoid application to waistline or areas where sitting would dislodge the patch. Do not apply to irritated, oily, damaged or broken skin. Do not apply to breasts. Rotate site with each application; allow an interval of ≥1 week between applications to the same site. Avoid touching adhesive with fingers. Press patch in place for ≥10 seconds to ensure proper application, especially around the edges. If patch falls off, may reapply same patch or apply a new patch to another area of the lower abdomen and follow the original treatment schedule. If patch lifts, apply pressure to maintain adhesion. When taking off the patch, remove slowly to avoid irritating the skin. Allow skin to dry for 15 minutes, then gently rub area with an oil-based cream or lotion if needed to remove any remaining adhesive. Prior to discarding, fold patch so that it sticks to itself. Do not discard by flushing in the toilet. Following application, avoid exposure of the transdermal patch to prolonged periods of sunlight.</p><h2>Dietary Considerations</h2><p>Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake when used for the prevention of osteoporosis.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions are permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F). Keep pouch sealed until ready to use.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Acitretin: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Progestins (Contraceptive).

Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.</p><p>Estrogens and progestins should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study reported increased risks of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in postmenopausal women 50 to 79 years of age during 5.6 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg relative to placebo.</p><p>Estrogen-alone therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The WHI estrogen-alone substudy reported increased risks of stroke and DVT in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 7.1 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg alone, relative to placebo.</p><p>The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) substudy reported increased risks of invasive breast cancer.</p><p>Estrogens and progestins should not be used for the prevention of dementia. The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a substudy of WHI, reported increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years and older during 4 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone 2.5 mg relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women.</p><p>Estrogen-alone therapy should not be used for the prevention of dementia. The WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of the WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years and older during 5.2 years of treatment with daily conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg alone, relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women.</p><p>In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of conjugated estrogens and other dosage forms of estrogens. Prescribe estrogens with or without progestins at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects: </i></b></p><p>• Breast cancer:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Based on data from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies, an increased risk of invasive breast cancer was observed in postmenopausal women using conjugated estrogens (CE) in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA).</b> Observational studies noted this risk declines once therapy is discontinued. The WHI study did not observe an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women with a hysterectomy using CE alone. The risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal patients on hormone therapy may depend upon type of estrogen and/or progestin, dose, timing of therapy initiation, duration of therapy, route of administration, and individual patient characteristics (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]; NAMS 2017). Hormone therapy may be associated with increased breast density (NAMS 2017); an increase in abnormal mammogram findings requiring further evaluation has been reported with estrogen alone or in combination with progestin therapy. Estrogen use may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases; discontinue estrogen if hypercalcemia occurs.</p><p>• Dementia:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Estrogens with or without progestin should not be used to prevent dementia. In the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), an increased incidence of probable dementia was observed in women ≥65 years of age taking CE alone or in combination with MPA.</b> Because the WHI memory studies were conducted in women ≥ 65 years of age, it is unknown if these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. However, hormone therapy is not recommended at any age to prevent or treat cognitive decline or dementia (AACE [Goodman 2011]; NAMS 2017)</p><p>• Endometrial cancer: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: The use of unopposed estrogen in women with an intact uterus is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. The addition of a progestin to estrogen therapy may decrease the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, a precursor to endometrial cancer. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling if indicated, should be performed to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding.</b> The risk of endometrial cancer appears to be dose and duration dependent, greatest with use ≥5 years, and may persist following discontinuation of therapy. The use of a progestin is not generally required when low doses of estrogen are used locally for vaginal atrophy, although long-term data (&gt;1 year) supporting this recommendation are lacking (NAMS 2013; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Lipid effects: Estrogens are generally associated with lipid effects such as increased HDL-cholesterol and decreased LDL-cholesterol. Triglycerides may also be increased; consider discontinuation of therapy if pancreatitis occurs.</p><p>• Ovarian cancer: Available information related to the use of menopausal estrogen or estrogen/progestin therapy and risk of ovarian cancer is inconsistent. If an association is present, the absolute risk is likely rare and may be influenced by duration of therapy (AACE [Goodman 2011]; ES [Stuenkel 2015]; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Retinal vascular thrombosis: Estrogens may cause retinal vascular thrombosis; discontinue pending examination if migraine, loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, or other visual disturbances occur; discontinue permanently if papilledema or retinal vascular lesions are observed on examination.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Asthma: Use caution in patients with asthma; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Carbohydrate intolerance: May impair glucose tolerance; use caution in patients with diabetes. Prior to therapy, consider age, cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in patients previously diagnosed with diabetes (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]).</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Estrogens with or without progestin should not be used to prevent cardiovascular disease. Using data from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies, an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stroke has been reported with CE and an increased risk of DVT, stroke, pulmonary emboli (PE) and myocardial infarction (MI) has been reported with CE with MPA in postmenopausal women 50 to 79 years of age.</b> Additional risk factors include diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, SLE, obesity, tobacco use, and/or history of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Risk factors should be managed appropriately; discontinue use immediately if adverse cardiovascular events occur or are suspected. Due to possible lower risk of thrombotic events, transdermal administration may be preferred for treating vasomotor symptoms of menopause in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]; ACOG 556 2013; ES [Stuenkel 2015]). Use is contraindicated in women with active DVT, PE, arterial thromboembolic disease (stroke and MI), or a history of these conditions.</p><p>• Diseases exacerbated by fluid retention: Estrogens plus progestins may cause fluid retention; use with caution in patients with diseases which may be exacerbated by fluid retention, including cardiac or renal dysfunction.</p><p>• Epilepsy: Use caution with epilepsy; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Gallbladder disease: Use of postmenopausal estrogen may be associated with an increased risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery.</p><p>• Hepatic dysfunction: Estrogens are poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Use caution with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with prior estrogen use or pregnancy. Discontinue if jaundice develops or if acute or chronic hepatic disturbances occur. Use is contraindicated in women with hepatic impairment or disease.</p><p>• Hepatic hemangiomas: Use with caution in patients with hepatic hemangiomas; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Hereditary angioedema: Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate angioedema symptoms in women with hereditary angioedema.</p><p>• Hypertension: Estrogens may cause substantial increases in blood pressure.</p><p>• Hypoparathyroidism: Use caution in patients with hypoparathyroidism; estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.</p><p>• Migraine: Use caution with migraine; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Porphyria: Use with caution in patients with porphyria; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• SLE: Use with caution in patients with SLE; may exacerbate disease.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues: </i></b></p><p>• Thyroid replacement therapy: Estrogens may increase thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone while receiving estrogens.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Surgical patients: Whenever possible, should be discontinued at least 4-6 weeks prior to elective surgery associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism or during periods of prolonged immobilization.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Transdermal patch: Following application, avoid exposure of the transdermal patch to prolonged periods of sunlight. Only one patch should be worn at any one time during the 7-day dosing interval. Swimming, bathing, or using a sauna while wearing the patch may decrease the adhesion of the patch and the delivery of the estrogen and progestin.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Duration of use: Extended use of menopausal hormone therapy may be considered for persistent vasomotor symptoms, issues related to quality of life, or for osteoporosis prevention in women at increased risk of fracture. Menopausal hormonal therapy does not need to be routinely discontinued in women &gt;60 years of age and may continue in women &gt;65 years of age after clinical evaluation and discussion of benefits and risks of treatment. Annual exams should be performed with a review of comorbidities; possible adjustments to safer lower-dose and/or route of administration should be discussed (ACOG 565 2013; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Laboratory changes: The use of estrogens and/or progestins may change the results of some laboratory tests (eg, coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, binding proteins). The dose, route, and the specific estrogen/progestin influences these changes.</p><p>• Osteoporosis: In women with premature menopause, hormone therapy to prevent bone loss may be used unless otherwise contraindicated; therapy should be reassessed when the average age of menopause is reached. It is also an appropriate bone-active therapy for women with vasomotor symptoms who are &lt;60 years of age or within 10 years of menopause onset. Use may be considered for women at high risk of fractures who are not candidates for other osteoporosis therapies (NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Risks vs benefits: When used for the relief of menopausal symptoms or increased risk of bone fracture/loss, the benefit-risk of hormone therapy is most favorable if started in patients who have no contraindications to therapy, are &lt;60 years of age, within 10 years of menopause onset, have a favorable lipid profile, and do not have the factor V Leiden genotype or metabolic syndrome. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease should also be considered when evaluating therapy and route of administration (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]; NAMS 2017). <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Estrogens with or without progestin should be used for the shortest duration possible at the lowest effective dose consistent with treatment goals.</b> Patients should be reevaluated as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary. Available data related to treatment risks are from Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies, which evaluated oral CE 0.625 mg with or without MPA 2.5 mg relative to placebo in postmenopausal women. Other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins were not studied. <b>Outcomes reported from clinical trials using CE with or without MPA should be assumed to be similar for other doses and other dosage forms of estrogens and progestins until comparable data becomes available.</b></p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Prior to therapy, baseline risk for breast cancer and CVD. During therapy, age appropriate breast and pelvic exams; blood pressure; unscheduled bleeding lasting &gt;6 months for endometrial pathology (sooner in patients who are obese, diabetic, or have a history of endometrial cancer); serum triglycerides (2 weeks after starting therapy in patients with baseline level &gt;200 mg/dL); TSH (6 to 12 weeks after starting oral therapy in patients taking thyroid replacement) (ES [Stuenkel 2015]).</p><p>Menopausal symptoms: Efficacy beginning 1 to 3 months after starting therapy, then every 6 to 12 months as appropriate. Duration of treatment should be evaluated at least annually (ES [Stuenkel 2015]). Monitoring of FSH and serum estradiol is not useful when managing vasomotor symptoms of menopause.</p><p>Prevention of osteoporosis: Bone density measurement</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Use during pregnancy is contraindicated.</p><p>Refer to individual monographs.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to put off soft, brittle bones (osteoporosis) in women after change of life.</p><p>• It is used to prevent or lower the signs of the change of life (menopause).</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
