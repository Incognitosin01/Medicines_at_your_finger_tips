It is a homeopathic complex medicine, whose active ingredients have been selected in order to promote 2 main activities:<br/>
•    Detoxification of the connective tissue matrix<br/>
•    Pain modulation through stimulation of the physiological mechanism of pain control.<br/>
Attenuation of the biological substrates acts to target the area of activity of the product.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/></p><h2>12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">12.1.    Mechanism of Action<br/>
Due to the homeopathic nature of the active ingredients, receptors may be activated by feedback regulation. Beta-endorphins  at the 4C dose activate the membrane receptors for endogenous endorphins that play a key role in pain relief.<br/>
12.2.    Pharmacodynamics<br/>
The physiological effects of GUNA®-NEURAL are due to the action of the ingredients, as described in the Homeopathic Materia Medica.<br/>
In Homeopathy there is no direct relationship between dose and effect, but rather there is a relationship between attenuation and balancing effect on biochemical pathways.<br/>
In GUNA®-NEURAL the attenuation of each ingredient has been selected according to  the Arndt-Schulz Principle (inverted effect law). membrane receptor feedback in order to normalize altered biological pathways. In Addition the attenuation technique activates the low dilutions and stabilizes clinical activity of the compound.<br/>
12.3.    Pharmacokinetics<br/>
The homeopathic attenuation provides complete bioavailability of the active ingredients.<br/></p><h2>13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><p class="First">13.1.    GUNA®-NEURAL  has no level of toxicity due to the attenuation of the ingredients.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>14. CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First">GUNA®-NEURAL formulation is based on classical Homeopathy and each ingredient has been selected according to its description in the Homeopathic Materia Medica. The product is intended for application to target points such as acupuncture points, Weihe points, and key neurological points.<br/>

Beta-Endorphin 4C:<br/>
•    Biological classification: Neuropeptide  and neurotransmitter. It is produced by the  anterior lobe of the hypophysis  and by the hypothalamus.<br/>
•    Etiopathogenesis: It acts on the mechanism that enhances pain. It suppresses the memory of painful events and negative experiences.<br/>
•    Space-time localization: Next to Arnica.<br/>
Reference group: Mercurius.<br/>
•    Clinical: Pain management by enhancing the immune response. It acts on modulating pain, cardiac, gastric and vascular function as well as panic syndrome and satiation. Organic and functional pain. Remedy for somatization disorders. It enhances acupuncture sessions. Antidepressive activity. It may improve individual positive attitudes.<br/>
•    Modalities: Worsens due to fatigue and intensive exercise.<br/>
•    Association with other cell mediators: Sepia / Arnica / Aconitum / Bromum / Aurum / Iodium / IL6 4C / Melatonin 15C, 30C, 12LM, 18LM, 30LM / NT4 4C / BDNF 4C.<br/>
