</ul><h3>Dosage for Erectile Dysfunction</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Starting Dosage for Erectile Dysfunction of Vasculogenic, Psychogenic, or Mixed Etiology.</span></p><p>Initiate dosing with 2.5 mcg of alprostadil. If there is a partial response at 2.5 mcg, the dose may be increased to 5 mcg within 1 hour. During titration, no more than 2 doses should be given within a 24-hour period. The optimal dose should produce an erection suitable for intercourse that does not exceed a duration of 1 hour. The patient must stay in the physician's office until complete detumescence occurs.</p><p>If additional titration is required, doses in increments of 5 to 10 mcg may be given at least 24 hours apart. Repeat the titration as necessary until the optimal dose is achieved.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Starting Dosage for Erectile Dysfunction of Pure Neurogenic Etiology (Spinal Cord Injury):</span></p><p>Initiate dosing with 1.25 mcg of alprostadil using CAVERJECT Sterile Powder. If there is a partial response, the dose may be increased to 2.5 mcg within 1 hour. No more than 2 doses during initial titration should be given within a 24-hour period. The optimal dose should produce an erection suitable for intercourse that does not exceed a duration of 1 hour. The patient must stay in the physician's office until complete detumescence occurs.</p><p>If additional titration is required, a dose of 5 mcg may be given during the next 24 hours. Thereafter, doses in increments of 5 mcg may be given at least 24 hours apart until the optimal dose is reached.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Maintenance Dosage for Erectile Dysfunction for Patient Home Use:</span></p><p>Once the dose of CAVERJECT IMPULSE has been determined in the physician's office, additional dose adjustment may be required after consultation with the physician. Adjust the dose in accordance with the titration guidelines described above. The recommended frequency of injection is no more than 3 times weekly, with at least 24 hours between each dose.</p><p>While on self-injection treatment, it is recommended that the patient visit the prescribing physician's office every 3 months to assess the efficacy and safety of the therapy and to adjust the dose of CAVERJECT IMPULSE, if needed.</p><h3>Patient Instruction for Self-Injection Technique for Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction</h3><p class="First">Instruct the patient on proper use and assess that they are well trained in the self-injection technique prior to initiation of at-home use. Advise the patient to read the Patient Information and Instructions for Use for detailed instructions on use of the product (<span class="Italics">see FDA-approved patient labeling [Patient Information and Instructions for Use]</span>).</p><h3>Adjunct to the Diagnosis of Erectile Dysfunction</h3><p class="First">To diagnose erectile dysfunction (pharmacologic testing), inject CAVERJECT IMPULSE intracavernosally and monitor patients for the occurrence of an erection. Extensions of this testing are the use of CAVERJECT as an adjunct to laboratory investigations, such as duplex or Doppler imaging. For any of these tests, use a single dose of CAVERJECT IMPULSE that induces a rigid erection.</p><h3>CAVERJECT IMPULSE Syringe Preparation</h3><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Caverject Impulse (alprostadil) for injection contains sterile, freeze-dried alprostadil for reconstitution and sterile bacteriostatic water in a prefilled dual chamber glass cartridge. It is available in 10 mcg and 20 mcg strengths.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">CAVERJECT IMPULSE should not be used:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>in men who have a known hypersensitivity to the drug <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span></li>
<li>in men who have conditions that predispose them to priapism, such as sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait, multiple myeloma, or leukemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men with fibrotic conditions of the penis, such as anatomical deformation, angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>in men with penile implants.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Prolonged Erection and Priapism</h3><p class="First">Prolonged erection defined as erection lasting between 4 to 6 hours in duration occurred in 4% of 1,861 patients treated up to 18 months in studies of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder. The incidence of priapism (erections lasting more than 6 hours in duration) was 0.4%. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may result.</p><p>To minimize the chances of prolonged erection or priapism, CAVERJECT IMPULSE should be titrated slowly to the lowest effective dose <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.1].</span> In addition, do not use CAVERJECT IMPULSE in patients who have conditions that predispose them to priapism, such as sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait, multiple myeloma, or leukemia <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Penile Fibrosis</h3><p class="First">The overall incidence of penile fibrosis, reported in clinical studies with CAVERJECT Sterile Powder was 3%. In one self-injection clinical study where duration of use was up to 18 months, the incidence of penile fibrosis was 7.8%.</p><p>Physical examination of the penis, should be performed periodically to detect signs of penile fibrosis. Treatment with CAVERJECT IMPULSE should be discontinued in patients who develop penile angulation or cavernosal fibrosis.</p><h3>Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Intracavernous injections of CAVERJECT IMPULSE can increase peripheral blood levels of alprostadil which can result in hypotension. Avoid use of CAVERJECT IMPULSE in patients with known cavernosal venous leakage.</p><h3>Injection Site Bleeding When Used With Anticoagulants</h3><p class="First">Patients on anticoagulants, such as warfarin or heparin, may have increased propensity for injection site bleeding after intracavernosal injection with CAVERJECT IMPULSE. Compress the site of injection with an alcohol swab or sterile gauze for 5 minutes.</p><h3>Cardiovascular Risk Related to Underlying Medical Conditions</h3><p class="First">There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CAVERJECT IMPULSE, generally should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. In addition, the evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.</p><h3>Risks Of Use in Combination With Other Vasoactive Medications Injected Intracavernosally</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of combinations of CAVERJECT IMPULSE and other vasoactive agents injected intracavernosally have not been established in clinical studies. The risks of prolonged erection, priapism, and hypotension may be increased.</p><h3>Needle Breakage</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">CAVERJECT IMPULSE uses a superfine (29 gauge) needle for administration. As with all superfine needles, the possibility of needle breakage exists and cases of needle breakage have been reported. Needle breakage, with a portion of the needle remaining in the penis, has been reported and, in some cases, required hospitalization and surgical removal. Careful instruction in proper patient handling and injection techniques may minimize the potential for needle breakage.</span></p><h3>Benzyl Alcohol</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The preservative benzyl alcohol contained in CAVERJECT IMPULSE has been associated with serious adverse events, including the "gasping syndrome", and death in pediatric patients. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. The risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity depends on the quantity administered and the liver and kidneys' capacity to detoxify the chemical. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. CAVERJECT IMPULSE is not indicated for pediatric patients.</span></p><h3>Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases</h3><p class="First">The use of CAVERJECT IMPULSE offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling of patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is advised.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Prolonged Erection and Priapism <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Penile Fibrosis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>CAVERJECT IMPULSE was evaluated in 87 patients in an open-label crossover study of 6 weeks treatment duration that compared the formulation of alprostadil for injection contained in CAVERJECT IMPULSE with the formulation contained in CAVERJECT Sterile Powder. Doses used in this study ranged from 2.5 mcg to 20 mcg. Adverse reactions reported for the CAVERJECT IMPULSE formulation included: penis disorder (4.6%), prolonged erection (1.1%), injection site erythema (1.1%), rash (1.1%), dizziness (1.1%), and hematospermia (1.1%). Penis disorder included penile pain, post-injection pain, and pain with erection.</p><p>CAVERJECT IMPULSE was also evaluated in 63 patients in a single-dose, double-blind, crossover study that compared CAVERJECT IMPULSE with CAVERJECT Sterile Powder. Doses used in this study ranged from 2.5 mcg to 20 mcg. Adverse reactions reported for the CAVERJECT IMPULSE formulation included: penile pain (1.6%) and pruritus (1.6%).</p><p>In addition to the adverse reactions observed for CAVERJECT IMPULSE in these two studies, the following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical studies of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Local Adverse Reactions:</span> Local adverse reactions derived from 1861 patients in clinical studies of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder, including an 18-month, open-label study, are shown in Table 1.</p><p>The following local adverse reactions were reported in &lt; 1% of patients: injection site hemorrhage, injection site inflammation, injection site itching, injection site swelling, injection site edema, urethral bleeding, penile warmth, numbness, irritation, sensitivity, pruritus, erythema, painful erection, and abnormal ejaculation.</p><p>In these studies, no local adverse reactions were reported in the 294 patients who received placebo, except for penile pain (2%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Penile Pain:</span> In the majority of the cases, penile pain was rated mild or moderate in intensity. Three percent of patients discontinued treatment because of penile pain</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Prolonged Erection/Priapism:</span> Prolonged erection was defined as an erection that lasted for 4 to 6 hours; priapism was defined as an erection that lasted 6 hours or longer. In clinical studies, the frequency of prolonged erection after intracavernosal administration of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder was 4%, while the frequency of priapism was 0.4% <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Penile Hematoma/Ecchymosis:</span> In clinical studies the frequency of penile hematoma and ecchymosis was 3% and 2%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Systemic Adverse Reactions</span><span class="Bold">:</span> Systemic adverse reactions reported by ≥ 1% of subjects in clinical studies of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder included: dizziness (1%).</p><p>The following systemic adverse reactions, were reported in &lt; 1% of patients: testicular pain, scrotal edema, hematuria, pelvic pain, hypotension, vasodilation, vasovagal reaction, diaphoresis, rash, and non-application site pruritus. Three patients (0.2%) discontinued due to symptomatic hypotension.</p><p>No systemic adverse reactions were reported in the 294 patients who received placebo.</p><h3>Post-marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following additional adverse reactions have been reported: device malfunction/failure, drug ineffective and drug effect decreased.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">The potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between alprostadil and other agents administered orally or intracavernosally has not been formally studied <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">CAVERJECT IMPULSE is not indicated for use in females.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">CAVERJECT IMPULSE is not indicated for use in females.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">CAVERJECT IMPULSE is not indicated for use in pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">A total of 341 subjects included in clinical studies were 65 and older. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and the other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdosage was not observed in clinical trials with CAVERJECT IMPULSE. If intracavernous overdose of CAVERJECT IMPULSE occurs, the patient should be under medical supervision until any systemic effects have resolved and/or until penile detumescence has occurred. Treatment of any systemic symptoms (e.g., hypotension) would be appropriate.</p><h2>CaverJect Impulse Description</h2><p class="First">CAVERJECT IMPULSE contains alprostadil a synthetic form of prostaglandin E<span class="Sub">1</span> (PGE<span class="Sub">1</span>) and is designated chemically as (11α,13E,15S)-11,15-dihydroxy-9-oxoprost-13-en-1-oic acid. The molecular weight is 354.49.</p><p>Alprostadil is a white to off-white crystalline powder with a melting point between 115° and 116°C. Its solubility at 35°C is 8000 micrograms (mcg) per 100 milliliter double distilled water.</p><p>The structural formula of alprostadil is represented below:</p><p></p><p>CAVERJECT IMPULSE is available as a disposable, single-dose, dual chamber syringe system. The system includes a glass cartridge which contains sterile, freeze-dried alprostadil in the front chamber and sterile bacteriostatic water for injection in the rear chamber. The alprostadil is reconstituted with the sterile bacteriostatic water just before injection. CAVERJECT IMPULSE is available in two strengths for intracavernosal administration:</p><p><span class="Bold">10 microgram</span> – The reconstituted solution has a volume of 0.64 mL. The delivered volume, 0.5 mL, contains 10 micrograms (mcg) of alprostadil, 324.7 mcg of alpha cyclodextrin, 45.4 mg of lactose, 23.5 mcg of sodium citrate, and 4.45 mg of benzyl alcohol.</p><p><span class="Bold">20 microgram</span> – The reconstituted solution has a volume of 0.64 mL. The delivered volume, 0.5 mL, contains 20 micrograms (mcg) of alprostadil, 649.3 mcg of alpha cyclodextrin, 45.4 mg of lactose, 23.5 mcg of sodium citrate, and 4.45 mg of benzyl alcohol.</p><p>During manufacture, the pH of the alprostadil for injection was adjusted with hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide before lyophilization.</p><h2>CaverJect Impulse - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Alprostadil induces erection by relaxation of trabecular smooth muscle and by dilation of cavernosal arteries. This leads to expansion of lacunar spaces and entrapment of blood by compressing the venules against the tunica albuginea, a process referred to as the corporal veno-occlusive mechanism.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">There are no results from pharmacodynamic studies in humans.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption:</span> For the treatment of erectile dysfunction, alprostadil is administered by injection into the corpora cavernosa. The absolute bioavailability of alprostadil has not been determined.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution:</span> Following intracavernosal injection of 20 mcg alprostadil, mean peripheral plasma concentrations of alprostadil at 30 and 60 minutes after injection (89 and 102 picograms/mL, respectively) were not significantly greater than baseline levels of endogenous alprostadil (96 picograms/mL). Plasma levels of alprostadil were measured using a radioimmunoassay method. Alprostadil is bound in plasma primarily to albumin (81% bound) and to a lesser extent α-globulin IV-4 fraction (55% bound). No significant binding to erythrocytes or white blood cells was observed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism:</span> Alprostadil is converted to compounds, which are further metabolized prior to excretion. Following intravenous administration, approximately 80% of circulating alprostadil is metabolized in one pass through the lungs, primarily by beta- and omega-oxidation. Following intracavernosal injection of 20 mcg alprostadil, peripheral levels of the major circulating metabolite, 13, 14-dihydro-15-oxo-PGE<span class="Sub">1</span>, increased to reach a peak 30 minutes after injection and returned to pre-dose levels by 60 minutes after injection.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Excretion:</span> The metabolites of alprostadil are excreted primarily by the kidney, with almost 90% of an administered intravenous dose excreted in urine within 24 hours post-dose. The remainder of the dose is excreted in the feces. There is no evidence of tissue retention of alprostadil or its metabolites following intravenous administration.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Geriatric:</span> The potential effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of alprostadil has not been formally evaluated.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Race:</span> The potential effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of alprostadil has not been formally evaluated.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal and Hepatic Insufficiency:</span> The pharmacokinetics of alprostadil have not been formally studied in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. The following battery of mutagenicity assays revealed no potential for mutagenesis: bacterial mutation (Ames), alkaline elution, rat micronucleus, sister chromatid exchange, CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation, and unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS). Rat reproductive studies indicate that alprostadil at doses of up to 0.2 mg/kg/day does not adversely affect or alter rat spermatogenesis, providing a 200-fold margin of safety compared with the usual human doses.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder was investigated in men with a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction due to psychogenic, vasculogenic, neurogenic, and/or mixed etiology in two double-blind placebo controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2) and in one 6-month open-label study (Study 3). In clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 3), over 80% of patients experienced an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse after intracavernosal injection of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder.</p><p class="First">Study 1: A total of 153 men with ED with a mean age of 53 years (range 23–69 years) were enrolled. The study had three phases: a 2.5 week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover phase in which each man received in-office injections of placebo or 2.5 mcg, 5 mcg, 7.5 mcg, or 10 mcg of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder; a 2 week, open-label, in-office dose-titration phase to identify the optimum home-use dose (the latter dose was defined as a dose inducing an erection sufficient for intercourse and lasting ≤ 60 minutes); and a 4-week open-label, at-home phase. In the double-blind placebo-controlled, crossover phase, each dose of CAVERJECT was significantly more effective than placebo by clinical evaluation ("full penile rigidity") and by RigiScan criteria (≥ 70% rigidity for at least 10 minutes); there was no response to placebo. The percentage of responders increased with increasing doses of CAVERJECT. The overall response rates in the crossover and dose-titration phases were 76% (117/153) by clinical evaluation and 51% (78/152) by RigiScan criteria. Seventy-three percent of the injections in 102 men who used CAVERJECT in the at-home phase resulted in satisfactory intercourse. Seventy-five percent of the men who used CAVERJECT in the at-home phase remained on the dose identified as optimum for them during the dose-titration phase; 17% and 8% of the men decreased or increased their dose, respectively. The mean duration of erection per injection was 70.8 minutes.</p><p class="First">Study 2: A total of 296 men with ED with a mean age of 54 years (range 21–74 years) were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-arm design study. The men were randomly assigned to one of five groups and received either a single dose of placebo, 2.5 mcg, 5 mcg, 10 mcg, or 20 mcg of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder. No patient responded to placebo. The differences in the response rates in both the clinical and the RigiScan evaluations between each of the doses of CAVERJECT and placebo were statistically significant. There was also a statistically significant dose-response relationship with higher clinical response rates and higher RigiScan response rates with increasing doses of CAVERJECT (with exception of the 10-mcg dose). The mean duration of erection after injection ranged from 12 minutes after the 2.5-mcg dose to 44 minutes after the 20-mcg dose and the relationship was linear (<span class="Italics">p</span> = .025, linear regression analysis).</p><p class="First">Study 3: The efficacy of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder was further evaluated in a 6-month, open-label, at-home study in 683 men with ED with a mean age of 58 years (range 20–79 years). The optimum dose of CAVERJECT was established by titration in 89% of men (606/683). A total of 471/683 men (69%) completed the 6-month study. Eighty-seven percent of the 13,762 injections of CAVERJECT administered resulted in satisfactory sexual activity. The mean duration of erection was 67.5 minutes.</p><p>The formulation of alprostadil contained in CAVERJECT IMPULSE was compared to CAVERJECT Sterile Powder in 87 men with ED in a single-blind, crossover study. The doses used by the patients in the study ranged from 2.5 mcg to 20 mcg and were the same for both formulations. The efficacy of the two formulations was shown to be comparable, as assessed by the 30-point erectile function (EF) domain score from the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and by a physician-assessment score for erectile response. The mean EF domain scores for CAVERJECT Sterile Powder and the formulation contained in CAVERJECT IMPULSE were 26.6 (SD=5.3) and 27.6 (SD=3.8), respectively. The mean physician's assessment scores for CAVERJECT Sterile Powder and the formulation contained in CAVERJECT IMPULSE were 2.6 (SD=0.6) and 2.7 (SD=0.5), respectively, based on a scale of 0 (no tumescence) to 3 (full rigidity).</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">CAVERJECT IMPULSE is supplied as a disposable, single-dose, dual chamber syringe system. The system includes a glass cartridge, which contains sterile, freeze-dried alprostadil in the front chamber and sterile bacteriostatic water for reconstitution in the rear chamber.
