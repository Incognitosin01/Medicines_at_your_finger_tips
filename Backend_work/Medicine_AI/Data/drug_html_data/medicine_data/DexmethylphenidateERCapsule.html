</ul><p class="First">CNS stimulants, including dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, other methylphenidate-containing products, and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>,</span> <span class="Italics">Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)].</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Dexmethylphenidate ER Capsule</h2><p class="First">Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules are indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><h2>Dexmethylphenidate ER Capsule Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>2.1 Pretreatment Screening</h3><p class="First">Prior to treating pediatric patients and adults with central nervous system (CNS) stimulants including dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, assess for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history including family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical examination) <span class="Italics">[ see Warnings and Precautions 5.2].</span><br/>
<br/>
Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy. Maintain careful prescription records, educate patients about abuse, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and periodically reevaluate the need for dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules use <span class="Italics">[ see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].</span></p><h3>2.2 Treatment of ADHD</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients New to Methylphenidate</span><br/>
<br/>
The recommended starting dosage of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules for patients who are not currently taking dexmethylphenidate or racemic methylphenidate, or for patients who are on stimulants other than methylphenidate are:<br/>
<br/>
• Pediatric patients: Start with 5 mg orally once daily in the morning with or without food.<br/>
<br/>
• Adult patients: Start with 10 mg orally once daily in the morning with or without food.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Patients Currently on Methylphenidate</span><br/>
<br/>
The recommended starting dose of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules for patients currently using methylphenidate is half the total daily dose of racemic methylphenidate.</p><p><br/>
Patients currently using dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride immediate-release tablets may be given the same daily dose of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Titration Schedule</span><br/>
<br/>
The dose may be titrated weekly in increments of 5 mg in pediatric patients and 10 mg in adult patients. The dose should be individualized according to the needs and response of the patient. Daily doses above 30 mg in pediatrics and 40 mg in adults have not been studied and are not recommended.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Maintenance/Extended Treatment</span><br/>
<br/>
Pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for extended periods. Periodically reevaluate the long-term use of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules and adjust dosage as needed.</p><h3>2.3 Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules is administered orally and may be taken whole or the capsule may be opened and the entire contents sprinkled onto applesauce. If the patient is using the sprinkled administration method, the sprinkled applesauce should be consumed immediately; it should not be stored. Patients should take the applesauce with sprinkled beads in its entirety without chewing. The dose of a single capsule should not be divided. The contents of the entire capsule should be taken, and patients should not take anything less than one capsule per day.</p><h3>2.4 Dose Reduction and Discontinuation</h3><p class="First">If paradoxical aggravation of symptoms or other adverse reactions occur, reduce the dosage, or if necessary, discontinue dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules. If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over a one-month period, the drug should be discontinued.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">• The 5 mg capsules are hard gelatin capsules, blue opaque cap printed with "G 5mg" and blue opaque body printed with "004" contains white to off-white pellets.<br/>

Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients treated with methylphenidate <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span><br/>
<br/>
• Concomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or within 14 days following discontinuation of treatment with an MAOI, because of the risk of hypertensive crises [ <span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>5.1 Potential for Abuse and Dependence</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants, including dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, other methylphenidate-containing products, and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)].</span></p><h3>5.2 Serious Cardiovascular Reactions</h3><p class="First">Sudden death, stroke and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults with CNS stimulant treatment at recommended doses. Sudden death has been reported in pediatric patients with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, and other serious heart problems. Further evaluate patients who develop exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or arrhythmias during dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules treatment.</p><h3>5.3 Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase approximately 2 to 4 mmHg) and heart rate (mean increase approximately 3 to 6 bpm). Individuals may have larger increases. Monitor all patients for hypertension and tachycardia.</p><h3>5.4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Exacerbation of Preexisting Psychosis</span></p><p><br/>
CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a preexisting psychotic disorder.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder</span><br/>
<br/>
CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed mood episode in patients. Prior to initiating treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, or depression).<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms</span><br/>
<br/>
CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients, compared to 0 in placebo-treated patients.</p><h3>5.5 Priapism</h3><p class="First">Prolonged and painful erections, sometimes requiring surgical intervention, have been reported with methylphenidate products in both pediatric and adult patients. Priapism was not reported with drug initiation but developed after some time on the drug, often subsequent to an increase in dose. Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal (drug holidays or during discontinuation). Patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections should seek immediate medical attention.</p><h3>5.6 Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud’s Phenomenon</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants, including dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon, were observed in postmarketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants.Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.</p><h3>5.7 Long-Term Suppression of Growth</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In a 7-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, the mean weight gain was greater for pediatric patients (ages 6 to 17 years) receiving placebo (+0.4 kg) than for patients receiving dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (-0.5 kg).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Careful follow-up of weight and height in pediatric patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated patients over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated pediatric patients (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development.</p><p>Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants, including dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, and patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Table 5: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Dexmethylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules</span></p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>8.1 Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Exposure Registry</span></p><p>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ADHD medications, including dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy registry for ADHD medications at 1-866-961-2388 or visit https://womensmentalhealth.org/adhd­medications/.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Dexmethylphenidate is the d-threo enantiomer of racemic methylphenidate. Published studies and post-marketing reports on methylphenidate use during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There may be risks to the fetus associated with the use of CNS stimulants use during pregnancy ( <span class="Italics">see Clinical Considerations</span>). Embryo-fetal development studies in rats showed delayed fetal skeletal ossification at doses up to 5 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day given to adults based on plasma levels. A decrease in pup weight in males was observed in a pre- and post-natal development study with oral administration of methylphenidate to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses 5 times the MRHD of 20 mg/day given to adults based on plasma levels ( <span class="Italics">see Data</span>).</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p>Clinical Considerations</p><p>Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</p><p>CNS stimulants such as dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, can cause vasoconstriction and thereby decrease placental perfusion. No fetal and/or neonatal adverse reactions have been reported with the use of therapeutic doses of methylphenidate during pregnancy; however, premature delivery and low birth weight infants have been reported in amphetamine-dependent mothers. Data</p><p>Animal Data</p><p>In embryo-fetal development studies conducted in rats and rabbits, dexmethylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 20 and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis. No evidence of malformations was found in either the rat or rabbit study; however, delayed fetal skeletal ossification was observed at the highest dose level in rats. When dexmethylphenidate was administered to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses of up to 20 mg/kg/day, postweaning body weight gain was decreased in male offspring at the highest dose, but no other effects on postnatal development were observed. At the highest doses tested, plasma levels [area under the curve (AUCs)] of dexmethylphenidate in pregnant rats and rabbits were approximately 5 and 1 times, respectively, those in adults dosed with 20 mg/day. Plasma levels in adults were comparatively similar to plasma levels in adolescents.</p><p>Racemic methylphenidate has been shown to cause malformations (increased incidence of fetal spina bifida) in rabbits when given in doses of 200 mg/kg/day throughout organogenesis.</p><h3>8.2 Lactation</h3><p class="First">Risk Summary</p><p>Dexmethylphenidate is the d-threo enantiomer of racemic methylphenidate. Limited published literature, based on milk sampling from seven mothers reports that methylphenidate is present in human milk, which resulted in infant doses of 0.16% to 0.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between1.1 and 2.7.

<span class="Bold">Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data</span><br/>
<br/>
Rats treated with racemic methylphenidate early in the postnatal period through sexual maturation demonstrated a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity in adulthood. A deficit in acquisition of a specific learning task was observed in females only. The doses at which these findings were observed are at least 6 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis.<br/>
<br/>
In a study conducted in young rats, racemic methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day for 9 weeks, starting early in the postnatal period (postnatal Day 7) and continuing through sexual maturity (postnatal Week 10). When these animals were tested as adults (postnatal Weeks 13 to14), decreased spontaneous locomotor activity was observed in males and females previously treated with 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day of racemic methylphenidate given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis) or greater, and a deficit in the acquisition of a specific learning task was seen in females exposed to the highest dose (8 times the MRHD given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis). The no effect level for juvenile neurobehavioral development in rats was 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the MRHD given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis).

Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride is the <span class="Italics">d-</span> threo enantiomer of racemic methylphenidate hydrochloride. Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules is an extended-release formulation of dexmethylphenidate with a bi-modal release profile. Each bead-filled dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsule contains half the dose as immediate-release beads and half as enteric-coated, delayed-release beads, thus providing an immediate release of dexmethylphenidate and a delayed release of dexmethylphenidate. Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules are intended for oral administration and is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 30 mg, 35 mg, and 40 mg extended-release capsules.</p><p><br/>

<br/>
<span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span><br/>
<br/>
At the recommended maximum total daily dosage of 40 mg, dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.</p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span><br/>
<br/>
Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules produces a bi-modal plasma concentration-time profile (i.e., 2 distinct peaks approximately 4 hours apart) when orally administered to healthy adults. The initial rate of absorption for dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules are similar to that of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets as shown by the similar rate parameters between the 2 formulations, i.e., first peak concentration (C <span class="Sub">max1</span>), and time to the first peak (t <span class="Sub">max1</span>), which is reached in 1.5 hours (typical range 1 to 4 hours). The mean time to the interpeak minimum (t <span class="Sub">minip</span>) is slightly shorter, and time to the second peak (t <span class="Sub">max2</span>) is slightly longer for dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules given once daily (about 6.5 hours, range 4.5 to 7 hours) compared to dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets given in 2 doses 4 hours apart (see Figure 1), although the ranges observed are greater for dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules given once daily exhibits a lower second peak concentration (C <span class="Sub">max2</span>), higher interpeak minimum concentrations (C <span class="Sub">minip</span>), and fewer peak and trough fluctuations than dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets given in 2 doses given 4 hours apart. This is due to an earlier onset and more prolonged absorption from the delayed-release beads (see Figure 1).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The ratio of geometric mean of AUC <span class="Sub">(0-inf)</span> and C <span class="Sub">max</span> after administration of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules given once daily are 1.02 and 0.86 respectively, to the same total dose of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets given in 2 doses 4 hours apart. The variability in C <span class="Sub">max</span>, C <span class="Sub">min</span>, and AUC is similar between dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules and dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride immediate-release tablets with approximately a 3-fold range in each.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Approximately 90% of the dose is absorbed after oral administration of radiolabeled racemic methylphenidate. However, due to first pass metabolism the mean absolute bioavailability of dexmethylphenidate when administered in various formulations was 22% to 25%.<br/>

<br/>
For patients unable to swallow the capsule, the contents may be sprinkled on applesauce and administered [ <span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2)</span>].<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Distribution</span><br/>
<br/>
The plasma protein binding of dexmethylphenidate is not known; racemic methylphenidate is bound to plasma proteins by 12% to 15%, independent of concentration. Dexmethylphenidate shows a volume of distribution of 2.65 ± 1.11 L/kg.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Elimination</span><br/>
<br/>
Plasma dexmethylphenidate concentrations decline monophasically following oral administration of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules. The mean terminal elimination half-life of dexmethylphenidate was about 3 hours in healthy adults. Pediatric patients tend to have slightly shorter half-lives with means of 2 to 3 hours. Dexmethylphenidate was eliminated with a mean clearance of 0.40 ± 0.12 L/hr/kg after intravenous administration.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Metabolism</span><br/>
<br/>
In humans, dexmethylphenidate is metabolized primarily via de-esterification to <span class="Italics">d-α</span>-phenyl-piperidine acetic acid (also known as <span class="Italics">d</span>-ritalinic acid). This metabolite has little or no pharmacological activity. There is no <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> interconversion to the <span class="Italics">l-threo-</span>enantiomer.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Excretion</span><br/>
<br/>
After oral dosing of radiolabeled racemic methylphenidate in humans, about 90% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine. The main urinary metabolite of racemic ( <span class="Italics">d,l</span>-) methylphenidate was <span class="Italics">d,l</span>-ritalinic acid, accountable for approximately 80% of the dose. Urinary excretion of parent compound accounted for 0.5% of an intravenous dose.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Studies in Specific Populations</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Male and Female Patients</span><br/>
<br/>
After administration of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, the first peak, (C <span class="Sub">max1</span>) was on average 45% higher in women. The interpeak minimum and the second peak also tended to be slightly higher in women although the difference was not statistically significant, and these patterns remained even after weight normalization.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Racial or Ethnic Groups</span><br/>
<br/>
There is insufficient experience with the use of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules to detect ethnic variations in pharmacokinetics.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span><br/>
<br/>
The pharmacokinetics of dexmethylphenidate after dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules administration have not been studied in pediatrics less than 18 years of age. When a similar formulation of racemic methylphenidate was examined in 15 patients between 10 and 12 years of age and 3 patients with ADHD between 7 and 9 years of age, the time to the first peak was similar, although the time until the between peak minimum, and the time until the second peak were delayed and more variable in pediatric patients compared to adults. After administration of the same dose to pediatric patients and adults, concentrations in pediatric patients were approximately twice the concentrations observed in adults. This higher exposure is almost completely due to smaller body size as no relevant age-related differences in dexmethylphenidate pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., clearance and volume of distribution) are observed after normalization to dose and weight.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span><br/>
<br/>
There is no experience with the use of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules in patients with renal impairment. Since renal clearance is not an important route of methylphenidate elimination, renal impairment is expected to have little effect on the pharmacokinetics of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Patients with Hepatic Impairment</span><br/>
<br/>
There is no experience with the use of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules in patients with hepatic impairment.<br/>

<span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span><br/>
<br/>
Methylphenidate is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes to a clinically relevant extent. Inducers or inhibitors of CYPs are not expected to have any relevant impact on methylphenidate pharmacokinetics. Conversely, the d- and l-enantiomers of methylphenidate did not relevantly inhibit CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 or 3A. Clinically, methylphenidate coadministration did not increase plasma concentrations of the CYP2D6 substrate desipramine.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>13.1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p><br/>
Lifetime carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out with dexmethylphenidate. In a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in B6C3F1 mice, racemic methylphenidate caused an increase in hepatocellular adenomas, and in males only, an increase in hepatoblastomas was seen at a daily dose of approximately 60 mg/kg/day. This dose is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 60 mg/day of racemic methylphenidate given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Hepatoblastoma is a relatively rare rodent malignant tumor type. There was no increase in total malignant hepatic tumors. The mouse strain used is sensitive to the development of hepatic tumors, and the significance of these results to humans is unknown.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Racemic methylphenidate did not cause any increase in tumors in a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in F344 rats; the highest dose used was approximately 45 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 4 times the MRHD (children) of 60 mg/day of racemic methylphenidate in children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In a 24-week carcinogenicity study with racemic methylphenidate in the transgenic mouse strain p <span class="Sup">53+/-</span>, which is sensitive to genotoxic carcinogens, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity. Male and female mice were fed diets containing the same concentrations as in the lifetime carcinogenicity study; the high-dose group was exposed to 60 to74 mg/kg/day of racemic methylphenidate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span><br/>
<br/>
Dexmethylphenidate was not mutagenic in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ames reverse mutation assay, in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, or in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. In an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assay using cultured Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells treated with racemic methylphenidate, sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations were increased, indicative of a weak clastogenic response.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span><br/>
<br/>
No human data on the effect of methylphenidate on fertility are available.<br/>
<br/>
Fertility studies have not been conducted with dexmethylphenidate. Racemic methylphenidate did not impair fertility in male or female mice that were fed diets containing the drug in an 18-week continuous breeding study. The study was conducted at doses of up to 160 mg/kg/day, approximately 10-times the maximum recommended human dose of 60 mg/day of racemic methylphenidate given to adolescents on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>14.1 Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 1) was conducted in 103 pediatric patients (ages 6 to 12, n = 86; ages 13 to 17, n = 17) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive or combined inattentive/hyperactive-impulsive subtypes (Study 1).</p><p><br/>
<br/>
Patients were randomized to receive either a flexible-dose of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (5 to 30 mg/day) or placebo once daily for 7 weeks. During the first 5 weeks of treatment patients were titrated to their optimal dose and remained on this optimal dose for the last 2 weeks of the study without dose changes or interruption.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated by comparing the mean change from baseline to endpoint for dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules and placebo-treated patients using an intent-to-treat analysis of the primary efficacy outcome measure, the DSM-IV total subscale score of the Conners ADHD/DSM-IV Scales for teachers (CADS-T). The CADS-T includes the ADHD Index (12 items) and the DSM-IV total subscale (18 items, total score range: 0 to 54); the latter is divided into inattentive (9 items) and hyperactive-impulsive (9 items) subscales. Teachers assessed behavior observed during the school day by completing the CADS-T weekly. A decrease in the CADS-T DSM-IV total subscale score from baseline indicates improvement.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The CADS-T total scores showed a statistically significant treatment effect in favor of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules than placebo Table (6). There were insufficient adolescents enrolled in this study to assess the efficacy for dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules in the adolescent population.However, pharmacokinetic considerations and evidence of effectiveness of immediate-release dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets in adolescents support the effectiveness of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules in this population.<br/>
