</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Doripenem</h2><h3>Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections</h3><p class="First">Doripenem for Injection is indicated as a single agent for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections caused by <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus,</span> and <span class="Italics">Peptostreptococcus micros</span>.</p><h3>Complicated Urinary Tract Infections, Including Pyelonephritis</h3><p class="First">Doripenem for Injection is indicated as a single agent for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis caused by <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span> including cases with concurrent bacteremia, <span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span>, <span class="Italics">Proteus mirabilis</span>, <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, and <span class="Italics">Acinetobacter baumannii</span>.</p><h3>Usage</h3><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Doripenem for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Doripenem for Injection should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting and modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Doripenem Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosage</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of Doripenem for Injection is 500 mg administered every 8 hours by intravenous infusion over one hour in patients ≥18 years of age. The recommended dosage and administration by infection is described in Table 1:</p><h3>Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The following formula may be used to estimate CrCl. The serum creatinine used in the formula should represent a steady state of renal function.</p><p>Doripenem for Injection is hemodialyzable; however, there is insufficient information to make dose adjustment recommendations in patients on hemodialysis.</p><h3>Preparation of Solutions</h3><p class="First">Doripenem for Injection does not contain a bacteriostatic preservative. Aseptic technique must be followed in preparation of the infusion solution.</p><p>To prepare Doripenem for Injection infusions in Baxter Minibag Plus™ infusion bags consult the infusion bag manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to use whenever solution and container permit. Doripenem for Injection infusions range from clear, colorless solutions to solutions that are clear and slightly yellow. Variations in color within this range do not affect the potency of the product.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Preparation of 500 mg Doripenem for Injection dose using the 500 mg vial</span></p><ul>

</ul><h3>Compatibility</h3><p class="First">The compatibility of Doripenem for Injection with other drugs has not been established. Doripenem for Injection should not be mixed with or physically added to solutions containing other drugs.</p><h3>Storage of Constituted Solutions</h3><p class="First">Upon constitution with sterile water for injection or 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) injection, Doripenem for Injection suspension in the vial may be held for 1-hour prior to transfer and dilution in the infusion bag.</p><p>Following dilution of the suspension with normal saline or 5% dextrose, Doripenem for Injection infusions stored at room temperature or under refrigeration should be completed according to the times in Table 3.</p><p>Constituted Doripenem for Injection suspension or Doripenem for Injection infusion should not be frozen. This storage information applies also to Doripenem for Injection diluted in Baxter Minibag Plus™.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Single use clear glass vials containing 250 mg or 500 mg (on an anhydrous basis) of sterile Doripenem powder for reconstitution.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Doripenem for Injection is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to Doripenem or to other drugs in the same class or in patients who have demonstrated anaphylactic reactions to beta-lactams.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Increased Mortality in Ventilator-Associated Bacterial Pneumonia</h3><p class="First">In a clinical trial of patients with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia comparing Doripenem to imipenem, more subjects receiving Doripenem died 23% (31/135) compared to those receiving imipenem 16.7% (22/132) based on 28-day all-cause mortality in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Clinical response rates were also lower in the Doripenem arm. Doripenem is not approved for the treatment of ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) and serious skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibiotics. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before therapy with Doripenem for Injection is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had a previous hypersensitivity reaction to other carbapenems, cephalosporins, penicillin or other allergens. If this product is to be given to a penicillin- or other beta-lactam-allergic patient, caution should be exercised because cross-reactivity among beta-lactam antibiotics has been clearly documented.</p><p>If an allergic reaction to Doripenem for Injection occurs, discontinue the drug. Serious acute hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions require emergency treatment, as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">Seizures have been reported during treatment with Doripenem (see section 6.2). In clinical trials, Doripenem-treated patients with pre-existing central nervous system (CNS) disorders (e.g. stroke or history of seizures), patients with compromised renal function and patients given doses greater than 500 mg every 8 hours appear to be at greater risk for developing seizures.</p><h3>Interaction with Valproic Acid</h3><p class="First">Due to a drug interaction, patients with seizure disorders controlled with valproic acid or sodium valproate will be at an increased risk for breakthrough seizures when treated with Doripenem for Injection concomitantly. Reduction in serum valproic acid concentrations to below the therapeutic concentration range (50 to 100 mcg/mL) was observed by 12 hours after the initiation of Doripenem in healthy subjects co-administered both drugs. A similar drug interaction involving other carbapenem antibacterials and valproic acid has been described in published case reports. In some of these reports, increasing the dose of valproic acid or sodium valproate did not result in increased valproic acid serum concentrations. Alternative antibacterial therapies should be considered for patients receiving valproic acid or sodium valproate. If administration of Doripenem for Injection is necessary, supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered. <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.1)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span></p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.</p><p>Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span></p><h3>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing Doripenem for Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>Pneumonitis with Inhalational Use</h3><p class="First">When Doripenem for Injection has been used investigationally via inhalation, pneumonitis has occurred. Doripenem for Injection should not be administered by this route.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of labeling:</p><ul>

<li>Pneumonitis with inhalational use <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be compared directly to rates from clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice.</p><p>During clinical investigations, 1338 adult patients were treated with Doripenem for Injection (1076 patients received Doripenem 500 mg administered over 1 hour every 8 hours and 262 patients received Doripenem 500 mg administered over 4 hours every 8 hours); in some patients parenteral therapy was followed by a switch to an oral antimicrobial. <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14)]</span> . The median age of patients treated with Doripenem for Injection was 54 years (range 18–90) in the comparative complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) study, 46 years (range 18–94) in the pooled comparative complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) studies, and 56 years (range 18-94) in the other Phase 3 trials. There was a female predominance (62%) in the comparative cUTI study and a male predominance (63% and 75%) in the comparative cIAI and other Phase 3 trials, respectively. The patients treated with Doripenem for Injection were predominantly Caucasian (79%) in the five comparator-controlled Phase 3 studies.</p><p>The most common adverse drug reactions (≥ 5%) observed in the five Doripenem for Injection comparator-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials were anemia, headache, nausea, diarrhea, rash, phlebitis, and elevated hepatic enzymes. During clinical trials, adverse events led to discontinuation of Doripenem for Injection in 4.1% (55 of 1338) of patients compared to 4.3% (58 of 1325) of comparator-treated patients.</p><p>Adverse reactions due to Doripenem for Injection 500 mg every 8 hours that occurred at a rate ≥ 1 % are listed in Table 4. Hypersensitivity reactions related to intravenous study drug occurred at a rate of less than 1%.</p><p>In a Phase 1 study of healthy subjects receiving Doripenem doses greater than the approved dose of 500 mg every 8 hours for 10 to 14 days, the incidence of rash was higher than that observed in subjects who received 500 mg every 8 hours. The rash resolved within 10 days after Doripenem administration was discontinued.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Doripenem. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hematologic</span></span><span class="Italics">:</span> Leukopenia, Neutropenia, Thrombocytopenia</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Immune System</span></span>: Anaphylaxis</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nervous System</span></span>: Seizure</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Renal:</span></span> Renal impairment/failure</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Respiratory</span></span>: Interstitial pneumonia</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Skin</span>:</span> Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Valproic Acid</h3><p class="First">Co-administration of Doripenem for Injection with valproic acid causes the serum concentrations of valproic acid to fall below the therapeutic range, increasing the risk for breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood, data from <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and animal studies suggest that Doripenem may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the plasma concentrations of valproic acid. This is consistent with case reports for other carbapenems, where serum concentrations of valproic acid were reduced upon co-administration with a carbapenem. If administration of Doripenem for Injection is necessary, supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered. The pharmacokinetics of Doripenem were unaffected by the co-administration of valproic acid. <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span></p><h3>Probenecid</h3><p class="First">Probenecid interferes with the active tubular secretion of Doripenem, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of Doripenem. <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span><span class="Italics">]</span> Coadministration of probenecid with Doripenem for Injection is not recommended.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Category B</span>: Doripenem was not teratogenic and did not produce effects on ossification, developmental delays, or fetal weight following intravenous administration during organogenesis at doses as high as 1 g/kg/day in rats and 50 mg/kg/day in rabbits (based on AUC, at least 2.4 and 0.8 times the exposure to humans dosed at 500 mg administered every 8 hours, respectively). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Doripenem for Injection is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Doripenem for Injection, 28% were 65 and over, while 12% were 75 and over. Clinical cure rates in complicated intra-abdominal and complicated urinary tract infections were slightly lower in patients ≥ 65 years of age and also in the subgroup of patients ≥ 75 years of age versus patients &lt; 65. These results were similar between Doripenem and comparator treatment groups.</p><p>This drug is known to be excreted substantially by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function or pre-renal azotemia. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function or pre-renal azotemia, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><p>Elderly subjects had greater Doripenem plasma concentrations relative to non-elderly subjects; however, this increase in exposure was mainly attributed to age-related changes in renal function. <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span><span class="Italics">]</span></p><p>No overall differences in safety were observed between older and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><h3>Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dosage adjustment is required in patients with moderately or severely impaired renal function. <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> In such patients, renal function should be monitored.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of overdose, Doripenem for Injection should be discontinued and general supportive treatment given.</p><p>Doripenem can be removed by hemodialysis. In subjects with end-stage renal disease administered Doripenem for Injection 500 mg, the mean total recovery of Doripenem and Doripenem-M1 in the dialysate following a 4-hour hemodialysis session was 259 mg (52% of the dose). However, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage. <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span><span class="Italics">]</span></p><h2>Doripenem Description</h2><p class="First">Doripenem for Injection (Doripenem monohydrate) vials contain 500 mg of Doripenem on an anhydrous basis, a white to slightly-yellowish off-white sterile crystalline powder. All references to Doripenem activity are expressed in terms of the active Doripenem moiety. The powder is constituted for intravenous infusion. The pH of the infusion solution is between 4.5 and 5.5.</p><p>Doripenem for Injection is not formulated with any inactive ingredients.</p><p>Doripenem for Injection (Doripenem monohydrate) is a synthetic broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic structurally related to beta-lactam antibiotics.

However, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship for Doripenem has not been evaluated in patients.</p><p>In a randomized, positive- and placebo-controlled crossover QT study, 60 healthy subjects were administered Doripenem for Injection 500 mg IV every 8 hours × 4 doses and Doripenem for Injection 1 g IV every 8 hours × 4 doses, placebo, and a single oral dose of positive control. At both the 500 mg and 1 g Doripenem for Injection doses, no significant effect on QTc interval was detected at peak plasma concentration or at any other time.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">• <span class="Bold">Plasma Concentrations</span></p><p>Mean plasma concentrations of Doripenem following a single 1-hour intravenous infusion of a 500 mg dose of Doripenem for Injection to 24 healthy subjects are shown below in Figure 1. The mean (SD) plasma C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC <span class="Sub">0–∞</span> values were 23.0 (6.6) mcg/mL and 36.3 (8.8) mcg∙hr/mL, respectively.</p><p>Figure 1. Average Doripenem Plasma Concentrations Versus Time Following a Single 1-Hour Intravenous Infusion of Doripenem for Injection 500 mg in Healthy Subjects (N=24)</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of Doripenem (C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC) are linear over a dose range of 500 mg to 1 g when intravenously infused over 1 hour. There is no accumulation of Doripenem following multiple intravenous infusions of either 500 mg or 1 g administered every 8 hours for 7 to 10 days in subjects with normal renal function.</p><p class="First">• <span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The average binding of Doripenem to plasma proteins is approximately 8.1% and is independent of plasma drug concentrations. The median (range) volume of distribution at steady state in healthy subjects is 16.8 L (8.09–55.5 L), similar to extracellular fluid volume (18.2 L).</p><p>Doripenem penetrates into several body fluids and tissues, including those at the site of infection for the approved indications. Doripenem concentrations in peritoneal and retroperitoneal fluid either match or exceed those required to inhibit most susceptible bacteria; however, the clinical relevance of this finding has not been established. Concentrations achieved in selected tissues and fluids following administration of Doripenem for Injection are shown in Table 5:</p><p class="First">• <span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Metabolism of Doripenem to a microbiologically inactive ring-opened metabolite (Doripenem-M1) occurs primarily via dehydropeptidase-I. The mean (SD) plasma Doripenem-M1-to-Doripenem AUC ratio following single 500 mg and 1 g doses in healthy subjects is 18% (7.2%).</p><p>In pooled human liver microsomes, no <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> metabolism of Doripenem could be detected, indicating that Doripenem is not a substrate for hepatic CYP450 enzymes.</p><p class="First">• <span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>Doripenem is primarily eliminated unchanged by the kidneys. The mean plasma terminal elimination half-life of Doripenem in healthy non-elderly adults is approximately 1 hour and mean (SD) plasma clearance is 15.9 (5.3) L/hour. Mean (SD) renal clearance is 10.3 (3.5) L/hour. The magnitude of this value, coupled with the significant decrease in the elimination of Doripenem with concomitant probenecid administration, suggests that Doripenem undergoes both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. In healthy adults given a single 500 mg dose of Doripenem for Injection, a mean of 71% and 15% of the dose was recovered in urine as unchanged drug and the ring-opened metabolite, respectively, within 48 hours. Following the administration of a single 500 mg dose of radiolabeled Doripenem to healthy adults, less than 1% of the total radioactivity was recovered in feces after one week.</p><p class="First">• <span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Following a single 500 mg dose of Doripenem for Injection, the mean AUC of Doripenem in subjects with mild (CrCl 50–79 mL/min), moderate (CrCl 31–50 mL/min), and severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min) was 1.6-, 2.8-, and 5.1-times that of age-matched healthy subjects with normal renal function (CrCl ≥ 80 mL/min), respectively.

The mean total recovery of Doripenem and Doripenem-M1 in the dialysate following a 4-hour HD session was 231 mg and 28 mg, respectively, or a total of 259 mg (52% of the dose).

Therefore, Doripenem is not expected to inhibit the clearance of drugs that are metabolized by these metabolic pathways in a clinically relevant manner.</p><p>Doripenem for Injection is also not expected to have CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4/5, or UGT1A1 enzyme-inducing properties based on <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies in cultured human hepatocytes.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">• <span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>Doripenem belongs to the carbapenem class of antimicrobials. Doripenem exerts its bactericidal activity by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. Doripenem inactivates multiple essential penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) resulting in inhibition of cell wall synthesis with subsequent cell death. In <span class="Italics">E. coli</span> and <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span>, Doripenem binds to PBP 2, which is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, as well as to PBPs 3 and 4.</p><p class="First">• <span class="Bold">Mechanism(s) of Resistance</span></p><p>Bacterial resistance mechanisms that affect Doripenem include drug inactivation by carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzymes, mutant or acquired PBPs, decreased outer membrane permeability, and active efflux. Doripenem is stable to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases, including penicillinases and cephalosporinases produced by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of carbapenem hydrolyzing beta-lactamases. Although cross-resistance may occur, some isolates resistant to other carbapenems may be susceptible to Doripenem.</p><p class="First">• <span class="Bold">Interaction with Other Antimicrobials</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> synergy tests with Doripenem show Doripenem has little potential to antagonize or be antagonized by other antibiotics (e.g., levofloxacin, amikacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, daptomycin, linezolid, and vancomycin).</p><p>Doripenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections. <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Indications and Usage (1)</span><span class="Italics">]</span></p><p class="First">Facultative Gram-negative microorganisms</p><ul>

</ul><p class="First">• <span class="Bold">Susceptibility Test Methods</span></p><p>When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the results of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dilution Techniques</span></p><p>Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method <span class="Sup">(1,3)</span> (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of Doripenem powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 6.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Diffusion Techniques</span></p><p>Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure <span class="Sup">(2,3)</span> requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 10 mcg of Doripenem to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to Doripenem.

The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the criteria in Table 6.</p><p>A report of <span class="Italics">Susceptible</span> indicates that the antimicrobial is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Quality Control</span></p><p>Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to monitor the performance of the supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test. Standard Doripenem powder should provide the MIC values provided in Table 7. For the diffusion techniques using a 10 mcg Doripenem disk, the criteria noted in Table 7 should be achieved.</p><h2>NON-CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Because of the short duration of treatment and intermittent clinical use, long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with Doripenem.</p><p>Doripenem did not show evidence of mutagenic activity in standard tests that included bacterial reverse mutation assay, chromosomal aberration assay with Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells, and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.</p><p>Intravenous injection of Doripenem had no adverse effects on general fertility of treated male and female rats or on postnatal development and reproductive performance of the offspring at doses as high as 1 g/kg/day (based on AUC, greater than 1.5 times the exposure to humans at the dose of 500 mg administered every 8 hours).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections</h3><p class="First">A total of 946 adults with complicated intra-abdominal infections were randomized and received study medications in two identical multinational, multi-center, double-blind studies comparing Doripenem for Injection (500 mg administered over 1 hour every 8 hours) to meropenem (1 g administered over 3–5 minutes every 8 hours). Both regimens allowed the option to switch to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg administered twice daily) after a minimum of 3 days of intravenous therapy for a total of 5–14 days of intravenous and oral treatment. Patients with complicated appendicitis or other complicated intra-abdominal infections, including bowel perforation, cholecystitis, intra-abdominal or solid organ abscess, and generalized peritonitis were enrolled.</p><p>Doripenem for Injection was non-inferior to meropenem with regard to clinical cure rates in microbiologically evaluable (ME) patients, i.e., in patients with susceptible pathogens isolated at baseline and no major protocol deviations at test of cure (TOC) visit, 25–45 days after completing therapy. Doripenem for Injection was also non-inferior to meropenem in microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) patients, i.e., patients with baseline pathogens isolated regardless of susceptibility. Clinical cure rates at TOC are displayed by patient populations in Table 8. Microbiological cure rates at TOC by pathogen in ME patients are presented in Table 9.</p><h3>Complicated Urinary Tract Infections, Including Pyelonephritis</h3><p class="First">A total of 1171 adults with complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis (49 percent of microbiologically evaluable patients) were randomized and received study medications in two multi-center, multinational studies. Complicated pyelonephritis, i.e., pyelonephritis associated with predisposing anatomical or functional abnormality, comprised 17% of patients with pyelonephritis. One study was double-blind and compared Doripenem for Injection (500 mg administered over 1 hour every 8 hours) to IV levofloxacin (250 mg administered every 24 hours). The second study was a non-comparative study but of otherwise similar design. Both studies permitted the option of switching to oral levofloxacin (250 mg administered every 24 hours) after a minimum of 3 days of IV therapy for a total of 10 days of treatment. Patients with confirmed concurrent bacteremia were allowed to receive 500 mg of IV levofloxacin (either IV or oral as appropriate) for a total of 10 to 14 days of treatment.</p><p>Doripenem for Injection was non-inferior to levofloxacin with regard to the microbiological eradication rates in microbiologically evaluable (ME) patients, i.e., patients with baseline uropathogens isolated, no major protocol deviations and urine cultures at test of cure (TOC) visit 5-11 days after completing therapy. Doripenem for Injection was also non-inferior to levofloxacin in microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) patients, i.e., patients with pretreatment urine cultures. Overall microbiological eradication rates at TOC and the 95% CIs for the comparative study are displayed in Table 10. Microbiological eradication rates at TOC by pathogen in ME patients are presented in Table 11.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Doripenem for Injection is supplied as single use type 1 clear glass vials containing 250 mg or 500 mg (on an anhydrous basis) of sterile Doripenem powder.

<li>Patients should be advised that allergic reactions, including serious allergic reactions, could occur and that serious reactions require immediate treatment. They should report any previous hypersensitivity reactions to Doripenem for Injection, other carbapenems, beta-lactams, or other allergens.</li>
<li>Patients should be counseled that anti-bacterial drugs including Doripenem for Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Doripenem for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Doripenem for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</li>
<li>Patients should be counseled to inform their physician
