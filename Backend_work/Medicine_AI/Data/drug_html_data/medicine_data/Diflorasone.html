Each gram of Diflorasone diacetate ointment contains 0.5 mg Diflorasone diacetate in an ointment base.<br/>
Chemically, Diflorasone diacetate is 6α,9-difluoro-11β,17,21-trihydroxy-16β-methylpregna-1,4-diene-<br/>
3,20-dione 17,21-diacetate. The structural formula is represented below:</p><p><br/>
<br/>
Each gram of Diflorasone diacetate ointment contains 0.5 mg Diflorasone diacetate in an ointment base of<br/>
glyceryl monostearate, propylene glycol and white petrolatum.</p><h2>Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><br/>
Topical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions.<br/>
The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various<br/>
laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or<br/>
clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a<br/>
recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span><br/>
The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors<br/>
including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings.<br/>
Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease<br/>
processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the<br/>
percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable<br/>
therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)<br/>
<br/>
Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways<br/>
similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in<br/>
varying degrees. They are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some<br/>
of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.<br/></p><h2>Indication and Usage</h2><p class="First">Topical corticosteroids are indicated for relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of<br/>
corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Topical steroids are contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the<br/>
components of the preparation.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Use of topical corticosteroids, including Diflorasone diactate dintment may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical Diflorasone diacetate products. Glaucoma, with possible damage to the optic nerve, and increased intraocular pressure have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical dermal corticosteroids.</p><p>Avoid contact of Diflorasone Diacetate Ointment with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><br/>
<span class="Bold">General</span><br/>
Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal<br/>
(HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some<br/>
patients.<br/>
Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use<br/>
over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.<br/>
Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or<br/>
under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by<br/>
using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt<br/>
should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less<br/>
potent steroid.<br/>
Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug.<br/>
Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic<br/>
corticosteroids.<br/>
Pediatric patients may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more<br/>
susceptible to systemic toxicity. (See PRECAUTIONS - Pediatric Use.)</p><p><br/>
If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.<br/>
In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent<br/>
should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be<br/>
discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Information for the Patient</span><br/>
Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:<br/>
1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact<br/>
with the eyes.<br/>
2. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than for which it was<br/>
prescribed.<br/>
3. Contact your healthcare provider if you experience blurred vision or other visual disturbances (see<br/>
WARNINGS).<br/>
4. The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occlusive<br/>
unless directed by the physician.<br/>
5. Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions especially under occlusive dressing.<br/>
6. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on an<br/>
infant or child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span><br/>
The following tests may be helpful in evaluating the HPA axis suppression:</p><p>Urinary free cortisol test<br/>
ACTH stimulation test</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span><br/>
Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect<br/>
on fertility of topical corticosteroids.<br/>
Diflorasone diacetate was not mutagenic in a micronucleus test in rats at intraperitoneal doses up to<br/>
2400 mg/kg.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span><br/>
Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at<br/>
relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after<br/>
dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant<br/>
women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical<br/>
corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk<br/>
to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or<br/>
for prolonged periods of time.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span><br/>
It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic<br/>
absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human<br/>
milk, caution should be exercised when Diflorasone Diacetate Ointment is administered to a nursing<br/>
woman.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span><br/>
Safety and effectiveness of Diflorasone diacetate ointment in pediatric patients have not been<br/>
established. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a<br/>
greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids.<br/>
They are, therefore, also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of<br/>
treatment and of Cushing's syndrome while on treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been<br/>
reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients.<br/>
HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in<br/>
pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric<br/>
patients include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence<br/>
of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging<br/>
fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span><br/>
Clinical studies of Diflorasone diacetate topical formulations did not include sufficient numbers of<br/>
subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following local adverse reactions have been identified from clinical trials or postmarketing<br/>
surveillance. Because they are reported from a population from unknown size, it is not always possible<br/>
to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to topical corticosteroids<br/>
exposure.</p><p><br/>
These adverse reactions may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings or prolonged<br/>
use of topical corticosteroids.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders</span>: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis,<br/>
hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis,<br/>
maceration of the skin, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Vision Disorders:</span> cataract, glaucoma, central serous chorioretinopathy</p><p><br/>
