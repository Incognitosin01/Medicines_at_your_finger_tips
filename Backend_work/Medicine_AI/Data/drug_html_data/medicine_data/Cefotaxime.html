Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Cefotaxime is injected into a muscle or into a vein through an IV. It is sometimes given through a central IV line placed into a large vein in your chest. You may be shown how to use an IV at home. Do not give yourself this medicine if you do not understand how to use the injection and properly dispose of needles, IV tubing, and other items used.</p><p>Cefotaxime must be mixed with a liquid (diluent) before using it. If you are using the injections at home, be sure you understand how to properly mix and store the medication.</p><p>Use a disposable needle and syringe only once.

Keep this container out of the reach of children and pets.</p><p>Use this medicine for the full prescribed length of time. Your symptoms may improve before the infection is completely cleared. Skipping doses may also increase your risk of further infection that is resistant to antibiotics. Cefotaxime will not treat a viral infection such as the flu or a common cold.</p><p>This medication can cause unusual results with certain lab tests for glucose (sugar) in the urine. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using cefotaxime.</p><p>If your medicine is frozen when you receive it, keep it frozen until you are ready to use the medicine.
