It is used to help prevent the symptoms of asthma. When used regularly (every day), inhaled fluticasone decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, it will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.</p><p>This medicine must be used with a short-acting medicine (eg, albuterol) for an asthma attack or asthma symptoms that need attention right away.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Armonair Respiclick</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Corticosteroids taken by mouth or injection have been shown to slow or stop growth in children and cause reduced adrenal gland function. If enough fluticasone is absorbed following inhalation, it is possible it also could cause these effects. Your doctor will want you to use the lowest possible dose of fluticasone that controls asthma. This will lessen the chance of an effect on growth or adrenal gland function. It is also important that children taking fluticasone visit their doctors regularly so that their growth rates may be monitored. Children who are taking this medicine may be more susceptible to infections, such as chickenpox or measles. Care should be taken to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. If the child is exposed or the disease develops, the doctor should be contacted and his or her directions should be followed carefully. Before this medicine is given to a child, you and your child's doctor should talk about the good this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ArmonAir® Digihaler™ as maintenance treatment for asthma in children 12 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 12 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluticasone in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of <i>Arnuity® Ellipta®</i>, <i>Flovent® Diskus®</i>, or <i>Flovent® HFA</i> than younger adults. Elderly patients are also more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving <i>Armonair®</i> or <i>Arnuity® Ellipta®</i>. .</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

It may not be specific to Armonair Respiclick. Please read with care.</b></p><p>Inhaled fluticasone is used to prevent asthma attacks. It is not used to relieve an attack that has already started. For relief of an asthma attack that has already started, you should use another medicine. If you do not have another medicine to use for an attack or if you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.</p><p><i>Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using this medicine without telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance of side effects. The full benefit of this medicine may take 1 to 2 weeks or longer to achieve.</p><p>Inhaled fluticasone comes with a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read these instructions carefully before using this medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your doctor to show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check regularly how you use the inhaler to make sure you are using it properly.</p><p><i>In order for this medicine to help prevent asthma attacks, it must be used every day in regularly spaced doses, as ordered by your doctor</i>.</p><p>Gargling and rinsing your mouth with water after each dose may help prevent hoarseness, throat irritation, and infection in the mouth. However, do <i>not</i> swallow the water after rinsing.</p><p>To use the <i>ArmonAir™ RespiClick®</i> or <i>ArmonAir® Digihaler™</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Take the inhaler out of the pouch before you use it for the first time.</li>
<li>Do not use the inhaler for this medicine with any other medicine.</li>
<li>This medicine does not require priming. Do not use it with a spacer or volume holding chamber.</li>
<li>Hold the inhaler upright and open the green cap all the way until it clicks. Do not open the green cap until you are ready to take a dose of this medicine.</li>
<li>To inhale this medicine, breathe out fully, trying to get as much air out of the lungs as possible. Put the mouthpiece fully into your mouth and close your lips around it. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue. Do not block the vent above the mouthpiece with your lips or fingers.</li>
<li>Breathe in through your mouth quickly and deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath. Hold your breath for about 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Close the green cap after each inhalation. Rinse your mouth with water without swallowing after each inhalation.</li>
<li>Keep the inhaler dry and clean at all times. Gently wipe the mouthpiece with a dry cloth or tissue as needed.</li>
<li>The inhaler has a window that shows the number of doses remaining. This tells you when you are getting low on medicine.

</ul><p>To use the <i>Arnuity® Ellipta®</i>:</p><ul>
<li>This medicine comes in foil tray. Peel back the lid to open.</li>
<li>Before you use this medicine, the counter should show the number 30. The counter counts down by 1 each time you open the cover.</li>
<li>Open the cover of the inhaler until you hear a clicking sound. The inhaler is now ready to use.</li>
<li>Do not close the cover until you have taken your dose. If you open and close the cover without inhaling the dose, you will lose the medicine.</li>
<li>Hold the inhaler away from your mouth and breathe out fully. Do not breathe out into the mouthpiece.</li>
<li>Close your lips around the mouthpiece. Do not cover the air holes on the side of the mouthpiece.</li>
<li>Breathe in through your mouth as steadily and as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath. Do not breathe in through your nose.</li>
<li>Hold your breath and remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Continue holding your breath as long as you can up to 3 to 4 seconds before breathing out. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs.</li>
<li>Hold the inhaler well away from your mouth and breathe out slowly and gently.</li>
<li>You may clean the mouthpiece with a dry tissue before you close the cover.</li>
<li>When the dose counter reaches "10", call your doctor or pharmacist if refill is needed. Throw away the inhaler when the dose counter is at "0".</li>
</ul><p>To use the <i>Flovent® Diskus®</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Take the inhaler out of the pouch before you use it for the first time.</li>
<li>To open it, push the thumb grip away from you as far as it will go. You will hear a click and feel a snap. When open, the mouthpiece will appear.</li>

<li>Turn your head away from the inhaler, and breathe out to the end of a normal breath. Do not breathe into the inhaler.</li>
<li>Breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath. Do not breathe through your nose.</li>
<li>Remove the mouthpiece from your mouth and hold your breath for about 10 seconds or for as long as you can, before breathing out slowly. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs.</li>
<li>If your doctor has told you to take more than one inhalation of medicine at each dose, take the second inhalation using exactly the same steps you used for your first dose.</li>
<li>The inhaler will deliver your medicine as a very fine powder. Do not take another dose even if you cannot taste or feel it.</li>

</ul><p>To use the <i>Flovent® HFA</i>:</p><ul>
<li>When you use the inhaler for the first time, or if you have not used it for 4 weeks or longer, it may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first puff. Test or prime it first by spraying the medicine into the air 4 times, away from your face. Spray the inhaler once into the air if it has not been used in 1 to 3 weeks. The inhaler will now be ready to give the right amount of medicine when you use it.</li>
<li>Shake the inhaler well for 5 seconds immediately before each use.</li>
<li>Take the cap off the mouthpiece (the strap will stay attached to the actuator). Inspect the mouthpiece for the presence of foreign objects and make sure that the canister is fully and firmly inserted into the actuator.</li>
<li>Breathe out fully through your mouth, expelling as much air from your lungs as possible. Place the mouthpiece fully into your mouth, holding the inhaler in the mouthpiece-down position and closing your lips around it.</li>
<li>While breathing in deeply and slowly through your mouth, fully depress the top of the metal canister with your finger. Immediately after the puff is delivered, release your finger from the canister and remove the inhaler from your mouth.</li>
<li>Hold your breath for about 10 seconds or for as long as you can, before breathing out slowly. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airway and lungs.</li>
<li>If your doctor has told you to inhale more than one puff or inhalation , wait about 30 seconds, then gently shake the inhaler for 5 seconds. Take the second inhalation using exactly the same steps you used for your first dose.</li>
<li>Rinse your mouth with water after breathing in the medicine. Do not swallow.</li>
<li>Replace the cap on the mouthpiece after each use.</li>
<li>Clean the actuator or mouthpiece at least once a week. Gently wipe the small circular opening where the medicine is sprayed out with a clean cotton swab dampened with water. Wipe the inside of the mouthpiece with a clean tissue dampened with water. Let it air dry overnight.</li>
<li>The inhaler has a dose counter that keeps track of how many more times you can use it before you need to open a new one. When the dose counter reaches "020", call your doctor or pharmacist if refill is needed.</li>
<li>If the dose counter is not working correctly, do not use the inhaler and return it to your pharmacy or doctor. Do not change the numbers or remove the counter from the canister. .</li>
