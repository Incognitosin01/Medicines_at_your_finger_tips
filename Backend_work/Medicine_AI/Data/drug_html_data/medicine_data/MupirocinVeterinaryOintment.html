Mupirocin is a naturally-occurring, broad-spectrum antibiotic. The chemical name is 9-4-[5S-(2S,3S-epoxy-5S-hydroxy-4Smethylhexyl)-3R,4R-dihydroxytetrahydropyran-2S-yl]-3-methylbut-2(E)-enoyloxy-nonanoic acid. The chemical structure is:</p><h2>Mupirocin Veterinary Ointment - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Mupirocin is a chemical entity produced by fermentation of the organism <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas fluorescens</span>. Mupirocin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specifically binding to bacterial isoleucyl transfer-RNA synthetase. Due to this mode of action, mupirocin shows no cross resistance with chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, lincomycin, neomycin, novobiocin, penicillin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. Mupirocin is an antimicrobial agent that inhibits the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Bacteria susceptible to the action of mupirocin <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> include the aerobic isolates of <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (including methicillin-resistant strains and β-lactamaseproducing strains), <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus intermedius, Staphylococcus epidermidis</span>, other coagulase positive or negative Staphylococci, α-hemolytic Streptococci, β group A Streptococci (including <span class="Italics">S. pyogenes)</span>, other β Streptococci (including <span class="Italics">S. agalactiae)</span>, group D Streptococci (including <span class="Italics">S. faecalis</span> and <span class="Italics">S. faecium)</span>, group Viridans Streptococci, <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium hofmanii, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Hemophilus influenzae</span> (including β-lactamase-producing strains), <span class="Italics">Neisseria gonorrheae</span> (including β-lactamase-producing strains), <span class="Italics">Neisseria meningitidis, Branhamella catarrhalis</span> and <span class="Italics">Pasteurella multocida</span>, and the anaerobic isolates of <span class="Italics">Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Clostridium difficile,</span> and <span class="Italics">Clostridium sporogenes</span>.</p><p>Clinical significance of the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> data is unknown except for susceptible strains of <span class="Italics">Staphylcoccus aureus</span> and <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus intermedius</span>.</p><h2>INDICATIONS FOR USE</h2><p class="First">Mupirocin ointment is indicated for the topical treatment of canine bacterial infections of the skin, including superficial pyoderma, caused by susceptible strains of <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> and <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus intermedius</span>.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This drug is contraindicated in animals with a history of sensitivity reactions to any of its components.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Because of the potential hazard of nephrotoxicity due to the polyethylene glycol content of the base, care should be exercised when using this product in treating extensive deep lesions where absorption of large quantities of polyethylene glycol is possible.</p><p>Safety of use in pregnant or breeding animals has not been determined.</p><p>Mupirocin ointment is not for ophthalmic use.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">No adverse reactions have been reported with this product.
