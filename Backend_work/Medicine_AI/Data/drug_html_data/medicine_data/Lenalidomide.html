This disorder is also called deletion 5q MDS, because part of chromosome 5 is missing. In people with this disorder, the bone marrow does not produce enough healthy blood cells.</p><p>Lenalidomide is also used to treat mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, or marginal zone lymphoma, after other medications have been tried without success.</p><p>Lenalidomide is available only under a special program. You must be registered in the program and understand the risks and benefits of  lenalidomide. You must also agree to use birth control measures as required by the program.</p><p>Lenalidomide may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Never use this medicine if you are pregnant. Even one dose of lenalidomide can cause severe, life-threatening birth defects or death of a baby if the mother or the father is taking this medicine at the time of conception or during pregnancy.</b></p><p>Use birth control to prevent pregnancy, whether you are a man or a woman. For women: Use two forms of birth control beginning 4 weeks before you start taking lenalidomide and ending 4 weeks after you stop taking it. For men: Use a condom to prevent pregnancy during your treatment, and for up to 4 weeks after your treatment ends.</p><p>Lenalidomide may cause blood clots. Stop using this medicine and call your doctor at once if you have symptoms such as sudden numbness, severe headache, problems with vision or speech, chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, or swelling in your arm or leg.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use lenalidomide if you are allergic to it.</p><p><b>Lenalidomide can cause severe, life-threatening birth defects or death of a baby if the mother or the father is taking  lenalidomide at the time of conception or during pregnancy.</b> Even one dose of lenalidomide can cause major birth defects of the baby's arms and legs, bones, ears, eyes, face, and heart. <b>Never use lenalidomide if you are pregnant.</b> Tell your doctor right away if your period is late while taking lenalidomide.</p><p><b>For Women:</b> If you have not had a hysterectomy, you will be required to use two reliable forms of birth control beginning 4 weeks before you start taking lenalidomide and ending 4 weeks after you stop taking it. Even women with fertility problems are required to use birth control while taking this medicine. You must also have a negative pregnancy test at 10 to 14 days before treatment and again at 24 hours before. While you are taking lenalidomide, you will have a pregnancy test every 2 to 4 weeks.</p><p>The birth control method you use must be proven highly effective, such as birth control pills, an intrauterine device (IUD), a tubal ligation, or a sexual partner's vasectomy. The extra form of birth control you use must be a barrier method such as a latex condom, a diaphragm, or a cervical cap.</p><p><b>Stop using lenalidomide and call your doctor at once if you quit using birth control, if your period is late, or if you think you might be pregnant.</b> Not having sexual intercourse (abstinence) is the most effective method of preventing pregnancy.</p><p><b>For Men:</b> If a man fathers a baby while using lenalidomide, the baby may have birth defects. <b>Use a condom to prevent pregnancy during your treatment, and for up to 4 weeks after your treatment ends.</b> You must agree in writing to always use latex condoms when having sex with a woman who is able to get pregnant, even if you have had a vasectomy. Contact your doctor if you have had unprotected sex, even once, or if you think your female sexual partner may be pregnant.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
