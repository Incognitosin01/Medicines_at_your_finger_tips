It has been noted that chloramphenicol is found in measurable amounts in the aqueous humor following local application to the eye. Development of resistance to chloramphenicol can be regarded as minimal for staphylococci and many other species of bacteria.</p><h2>Indications and Usage</h2><p class="First">Chloramphenicol should be used only in those serious infections for which less potentially dangerous drugs are ineffective or contraindicated. Bacteriological studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their sensitivity to chloramphenicol (see Boxed Warning).</p><p>Chloromycetin Ophthalmic Ointment, 1% (Chloramphenicol Ophthalmic Ointment, USP) is indicated for the treatment of surface ocular infections involving the conjunctiva and/or cornea caused by chloramphenicol-susceptible organisms.</p><p>The particular antiinfective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens:</p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus</span>, including <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Klebsiella/Enterobacter</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Moraxella lucunata</span></p><p>    (Morax-Axenfeld bacillus)</p><p><span class="Italics">Neisseria</span> species</p><p>This product does not provide adequate coverage against:</p><p><span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Serratia marcescens</span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in persons sensitive to any of its components.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">SEE BOXED WARNING</p><p>Ophthalmic ointments may retard corneal wound healing.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">The prolonged use of antibiotics may occasionally result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi.
