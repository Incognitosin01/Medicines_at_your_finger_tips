The powder for oral solution is used to treat infantile spasms in babies and children between the ages of 1 month and 2 years.</p><p><b>Sabril can cause serious side effects and should be used only by people who have been unable to control their seizures with several other medications.</b></p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Taking Sabril can cause permanent vision loss,</b> even after you stop using this medicine. Tell your doctor if you have any vision problems, such as retinitis or glaucoma and advise your doctor right away about any changes in your vision. You must have frequent eye exams before, during, and shortly after taking this medicine.</p><p>To be sure Sabril is not causing harmful effects on your vision, you will need a thorough eye exam before you start taking the medication and then every 3 months during treatment, even if your vision seems normal. If you ever stop taking this medicine, you may still need to have eye exams every 3 to 6 months after your treatment ends. Do not miss any follow-up visits to your doctor.</p><p>Some babies treated with vigabatrin have had abnormal brain changes seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Tell any doctor who treats your baby that the child is taking this medicine.</p><p>Some people have thoughts about suicide while taking seizure medication. Stay alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor.</p><p><b>Sabril should be used only by people who have been unable to control their seizures with several other medications.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Some people taking Sabril have developed vision problems within weeks to years after starting treatment. <b>Vision loss caused by vigabatrin may be permanent, and you may notice only mild symptoms at first.</b> Talk to your doctor about this possibility.</p><p>Sabril is available only from a certified pharmacy under a special program. You must be registered in the program and agree to have vision exams before, during, and shortly after taking vigabatrin. Be sure you understand the risks and benefits of taking this medicine.</p><p>You should not use Sabril if you are allergic to vigabatrin.</p><p>To make sure Sabril is safe for you, tell your doctor if you (or the child taking this medicine) have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>vision problems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kidney disease;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>anemia (low red blood cells); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>depression, a mood disorder, mental illness, or suicidal thoughts or actions.</p>

</ul><p>vision problems;</p><p>kidney disease;</p><p>anemia (low red blood cells); or</p><p>depression, a mood disorder, mental illness, or suicidal thoughts or actions.</p><p>Some people have thoughts about suicide while taking Sabril. Your doctor will need to check your progress at regular visits. Your family or other caregivers should also be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms.</p><p><b>Do not start or stop taking seizure medication during pregnancy without your doctor's advice.</b> Having a seizure during pregnancy could harm both mother and baby. <b>Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant.</b></p><p>If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry to track the effects of vigabatrin on the baby.</p><p>You should not breastfeed while you are using Sabril.</p><p>Do not give this medicine to a child without medical advice.</p><h2>How should I take Sabril?</h2><p>Take Sabril exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose.</p><p>You may take Sabril with or without food.</p><p>Sabril powder must be mixed only with water, and can be given to the child with a meal. Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p><b>Anyone taking Sabril can develop vision problems that could get worse</b>, even after you stop using this medicine. The more you take this medicine, the more likely you are to develop severe vision problems.</p><p>You will need a thorough eye exam before you start taking this medicine and then every 3 months during treatment, even if your vision seems normal. Eye exams may not fully prevent vision damage, but they will help your doctor decide whether to change your treatment plan. <b>Stay alert to any changes in your vision and report them to your doctor right away.</b></p><p>If you stop taking Sabril, you should have another eye exam about 3 to 6 months after your last dose.</p><p>It may be more difficult to test vision in a baby or young child. However, your doctor may still prescribe vigabatrin for the child if the benefit of preventing seizures outweighs any risk. <b>Tell the doctor right away if you think your child's vision may be changing.</b></p><p>Call your doctor if your complex partial seizures do not improve after 3 months of treatment, or if your baby's infantile spasms do not improve after 2 to 4 weeks of treatment.</p><p>Do not stop using Sabril suddenly, even if you feel fine. Stopping suddenly may cause increased seizures. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.</p><p>Store in the original container at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Seizure Prophylaxis:</b></p><p>Initial dose: 1 g orally daily (administered as one 500 mg orally 2 times daily) with or without food<br/>
