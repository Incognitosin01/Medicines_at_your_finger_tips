Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of hepatitis b immune globulin</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you hepatitis b immune globulin in a hospital.

If you had sexual contact with a person who has hepatitis B, you should receive hepatitis b immune globulin within 14 days. If you were exposed some other way, you should receive hepatitis b immune globulin within 24 hours of being exposed to hepatitis B.</p><p>You may need to have a second dose of medicine 1 month after the first dose.

Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash; itching; swelling of the face, tongue, and throat; trouble breathing; or chest pain after receiving the medicine.</p><p>If you are also using insulin or other medicine for diabetes, you will need to be aware of the symptoms of hypoglycemia (confusion, irritability, double or blurred vision, and in severe cases seizures or loss of consciousness) because hepatitis b immune globulin may affect the results of blood sugar tests. Let your doctor know if you experience hypoglycemia on a regular basis while receiving hepatitis b immune globulin.</p><p>Hepatitis b immune globulin is made from donated human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses to people who have received them. The risk of getting a virus from medicines made from human blood has been greatly reduced in recent years. This is the result of required testing of human donors for certain viruses, and required testing of the medicine when it is made. Although the risk is low, talk with your doctor if you have concerns.</p><p>Hepatitis b immune globulin may cause blood clots. This is more likely to occur if you have a history of blood clotting problems, heart disease, or atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), or must stay in bed for a long time because of surgery or illness. Check with your doctor right away if you suddenly have chest pain, shortness of breath, a severe headache, leg pain, or problems with vision, speech, or walking.</p><p>Talk to your doctor before getting flu shots or other vaccines while receiving or after receiving hepatitis B immune globulin.
