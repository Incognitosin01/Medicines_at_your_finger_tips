It is used when a patient's asthma has not been controlled sufficiently on other asthma medicines, or when a patient's condition is so severe that more than one medicine is needed every day. This medicine will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.</p><p>This medicine is also used to treat air flow blockage and reduce the worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.</p><p>Inhaled budesonide belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids (cortisone-like medicines). It works by preventing inflammation (swelling) in the lungs that causes an asthma attack.</p><p>Inhaled formoterol belongs to the family of medicines known as bronchodilators. It works by helping the muscles around the airways in your lungs stay relaxed to prevent asthma symptoms, such as wheezing and shortness of breath. This increases the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Symbicort 200 Turbuhaler</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of budesonide and formoterol combination in children 6 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 6 years of age. .</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of budesonide and formoterol combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients with heart problems may require special caution when receiving budesonide and formoterol combination.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Symbicort 200 Turbuhaler</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain budesonide and formoterol.  It may not be specific to Symbicort 200 Turbuhaler. Please read with care.</b></p><p>Inhaled fluticasone and salmeterol is used to prevent asthma attacks and treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is not used to relieve an asthma attack that has already started. For relief of an asthma attack that has already started, you should use another medicine. If you do not have another medicine to use for an attack or if you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.</p><p>This medicine is used with a special inhaler and usually comes with a patient information leaflet or patient instructions. Read the directions carefully before using this medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check regularly how you use the inhaler to make sure you are using it properly.</p><p><i>Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using this medicine without telling your doctor first. To do so may increase the chance of side effects. The full benefit of this medicine may take 1 to 2 weeks or longer to achieve.</p><p><i>In order for this medicine to help prevent asthma attacks, it must be used every day in regularly spaced doses, as ordered by your doctor</i>.</p><p>When you use the inhaler for the first time, or if you have not used it for 7 days or longer, or if the inhaler has been dropped, it may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first inhalation. Therefore, before using the inhaler, prime it by spraying the medicine 2 times into the air away from the face, and shaking it well for 5 seconds before each spray.</p><p>How to use this medicine:</p><ul>
<li>Take the inhaler out of the moisture-protective foil pouch before you use it for the first time.</li>
<li>Do not use the inhaler for this medicine with any other medicine.</li>
<li>Prime the inhaler before use by shaking the inhaler well for 5 seconds and then releasing a test spray. Once again, shake the inhaler and release a second test spray.</li>
<li>Breathe out to the end of a normal breath (exhale). Do not breathe into the inhaler.</li>
<li>Put the mouthpiece fully into your mouth and close your lips around it. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue.</li>
<li>While pressing down firmly and fully on the grey top of the inhaler, breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath.</li>
<li>Hold your breath and remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Continue holding your breath for as long as you can up to 10 seconds before breathing out slowly. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs.</li>
<li>Release your finger from the grey top and then turn your head away from the inhaler. Breathe out slowly to the end of a normal breath. Do not breathe into the inhaler.</li>
<li>Shake the inhaler again for 5 seconds and take the second inhalation following exactly the same steps you used for the first inhalation.</li>
<li>Replace the mouthpiece cover after using the medicine.</li>
<li>Gargle and rinse your mouth with water after each dose. This will help prevent hoarseness, throat irritation, and infection in the mouth. Do not swallow the water after rinsing.</li>
</ul><p>The dose counter at the top of the inhaler will turn yellow when the inhaler has 20 or fewer doses left. Throw the inhaler when it reaches 0, or if it has been 3 months since you last opened the foil pouch.</p><p>Clean the inhaler every 7 days by wiping the mouthpiece with a dry cloth. Do not put the inhaler into water or try to take it apart. However, you must use a new inhaler with each refill of your medicine.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
