Reserve codeine/chlorpheniramine for use in adult patients for whom the benefits of cough suppression are expected to outweigh the risks, and in whom an adequate assessment of the etiology of the cough has been made. Assess each patient’s risk prior to prescribing codeine/chlorpheniramine, prescribe codeine/chlorpheniramine for the shortest duration that is consistent with individual patient treatment goals, monitor all patients regularly for the development of addiction or abuse, and refill only after reevaluation of the need for continued treatment.</p><p>Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of codeine/chlorpheniramine. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of codeine/chlorpheniramine therapy or when used in patients at higher risk.</p><p>Accidental ingestion of even one dose of codeine/chlorpheniramine, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of codeine.</p><p>Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine. Most of the reported cases occurred following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine due to a CYP450 2D6 polymorphism. Codeine/chlorpheniramine is contraindicated in pediatric patients &lt;12 years and pediatric patients &lt;18 years following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Avoid the use of codeine/chlorpheniramine in pediatric patients 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine.</p><p>Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering codeine/chlorpheniramine. Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. Always use an accurate milliliter measuring device when measuring and administering codeine/chlorpheniramine.</p><p>The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with codeine are complex, requiring careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, codeine, and the active metabolite, morphine. Avoid the use of codeine/chlorpheniramine in patients who are taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor, CYP3A4 inducer, or 2D6 inhibitor.</p><p>Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Avoid use of opioid cough medications in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.</p><p>Codeine/chlorpheniramine is not recommended for use in pregnant women. Prolonged use of codeine/chlorpheniramine during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If codeine/chlorpheniramine is used for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• CNS depression: May cause CNS depression, which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks which require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving).</p><p>• Constipation: May cause or aggravate constipation; chronic use may result in obstructive bowel disease, particularly in those with underlying intestinal motility disorders. May also be problematic in patients with unstable angina and patients post-myocardial infarction.</p><p>• Hypotension: May cause severe hypotension (including orthostasis and syncope); risk is increased in patients with reduced blood volume or taking concurrent CNS depressants (eg, phenothiazines, general anesthetics). Avoid use in patients with circulatory shock.</p><p>• Phenanthrene hypersensitivity: Use with caution in patients with hypersensitivity reactions to other phenanthrene-derivative opioid agonists (hydrocodone, hydromorphone, levorphanol, oxycodone, oxymorphone).</p><p>• Respiratory depression: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with codeine. Monitor closely for respiratory depression, especially during initiation or when used in patients at higher risk</b> (including patients with chronic pulmonary disease, decreased respiratory reserve, altered pharmacokinetics or clearance and in patients taking concurrent drugs that may cause respiratory depression). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Patients and caregivers should be educated on how to recognize respiratory depression and the importance of getting emergency assistance immediately (eg, calling 911) in the event of known or suspected overdose.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Abdominal conditions: May obscure diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions. Use with caution in patients with underlying intestinal motility disorders; may result in constipation or obstructive bowel disease. Use is contraindicated with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>• Adrenocortical insufficiency: Use with caution in patients with adrenal insufficiency, including Addison disease. Long-term opioid use may cause secondary hypogonadism, which may lead to mood disorders and osteoporosis (Brennan 2013).</p><p>• Biliary tract impairment: Use with caution in patients with biliary tract dysfunction or acute pancreatitis; opioids may cause constriction of sphincter of Oddi and increase biliary tract pressure.</p><p>• Delirium tremens: Use with caution in patients with delirium tremens.</p><p>• Head trauma: Avoid use in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or elevated intracranial pressure (ICP); exaggerated elevation of ICP may occur.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment.</p><p>• Obesity: Use with caution in patients who are morbidly obese.</p><p>• Prostatic hyperplasia/urinary obstruction: Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia and/or urinary stricture.</p><p>• Psychosis: Use with caution in patients with toxic psychosis.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment.</p><p>• Respiratory disease: Use with caution and monitor for respiratory depression in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercarbia, or preexisting respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy; critical respiratory depression may occur, even at therapeutic dosages. Avoid use in patients with acute febrile illness associated with productive cough or in patients with chronic respiratory disease unable to clear secretions. Use is contraindicated in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or without resuscitative equipment.</p><p>• Seizures: Use with caution in patients with a history of seizure disorder; may cause or exacerbate preexisting seizures.</p><p>• Thyroid dysfunction: Use with caution in patients with thyroid dysfunction.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Avoid concomitant use with benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.</b> Consider prescribing naloxone for emergency treatment of opioid overdose in patients taking benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants concomitantly with opioids.</p><p>• CYP3A4 interactions: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of CYP450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with codeine are complex. Use of CYP450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with codeine requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, codeine, and the active metabolite morphine. Avoid use in patients taking a CYP 3A4 inhibitor or inducer or a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</b> If concomitant use is necessary, monitor for signs and symptoms of toxicity or withdrawal.</p><p><b><i>Special populations: </i></b></p><p>• CYP2D6 “ultrarapid metabolizers”: Avoid use in patients who are ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype (gene duplications donated as *1/*1xN or *1/*2xN); these patients may have extensive conversion of codeine to its active metabolite and thus increased opioid-mediated effects. The occurrence of this phenotype is seen in approximately 1% to 2% of East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), 1% to 10% of Caucasians, 3% to 4% of African-Americans, and may be &gt;10% in certain racial/ethnic groups (ie, Oceanian, Northern African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican).</p><p>• Cachectic or debilitated patients: Use with caution in cachectic or debilitated patients; there is a greater potential for critical respiratory depression, even at therapeutic dosages.</p><p>• Elderly: Use with caution in the elderly; may be more sensitive to adverse effects.</p><p>• Neonates: Neonatal withdrawal syndrome:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy can cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.</b>Signs and symptoms include irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high-pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. Onset, duration, and severity depend on the drug used, duration of use, maternal dose, and rate of drug elimination by the newborn.</p><p>• Pediatric: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine. Most of the reported cases occurred following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine due to a CYP450 2D6 polymorphism. Codeine/chlorpheniramine is contraindicated in pediatric patients &lt;12 years and pediatric patients &lt;18 years following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Avoid the use of codeine/chlorpheniramine in pediatric patients 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine.</b> Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression. Deaths have also occurred in breastfeeding infants after being exposed to high concentrations of morphine because the mothers were ultra-rapid metabolizers.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions: </i></b></p><p>• Abuse/misuse/diversion: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Codeine/chlorpheniramine exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Reserve for use in adult patients for whom the benefits of cough suppression are expected to outweigh the risks, and in whom an adequate assessment of the etiology of the cough has been made. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing and prescribe for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals, monitor all patients regularly for the development of addiction or abuse, and refill only after reevaluation of the need for continued treatment</b> Use with caution in patients with a history of drug abuse or acute alcoholism; potential for drug dependency exists; do not abruptly discontinue in a physically dependent patient. Other risk factors associated with increased risk include a personal or family history of substance use disorder or mental illness (eg, major depression).</p><p>• Accidental ingestion: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Accidental ingestion of even one dose of codeine/chlorpheniramine, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of codeine. </b></p><p>• Administration: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing and administering codeine/chlorpheniramine. Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. <b>Always use an accurate milliliter measuring device when measuring and administering. </b></b>A household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage, which can result in serious adverse reactions.</p><p>• Cough: Appropriate use: Underlying cause of cough should be determined prior to prescribing and re-evaluated within 5 days for an unresponsive cough. Reserve for use in adult patients where benefits of cough suppression outweigh the risks and in patients who have had an adequate assessment of cough etiology.</p><p>• Naloxone access: Discuss the availability of naloxone with all patients who are prescribed opioid analgesics, as well as their caregivers, and consider prescribing it to patients who are at increased risk of opioid overdose. These include patients who are also taking benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, have an opioid use disorder (OUD) (current or history of), or have experienced a previous opioid overdose. Additionally, health care providers should consider prescribing naloxone to patients prescribed medications to treat OUD; patients at risk of opioid overdose even if they are not taking an opioid analgesic or medication to treat OUD; and patients taking opioids, including methadone or buprenorphine for OUD, if they have household members, including children, or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. Inform patients and caregivers on options for obtaining naloxone (eg, by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, a community-based program) as permitted by state dispensing and prescribing guidelines. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression, proper administration of naloxone, and getting emergency help (FDA 2020).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Relief of symptoms; respiratory and mental status; bowel function; signs/symptoms of addiction, abuse, or misuse</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Long-term opioid use may cause secondary hypogonadism, which may lead to sexual dysfunction and infertility (Brennan 2013).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p><b>[US Boxed Warning]: Use is not recommended in pregnant women.
