You’ve joined millions of others who have made the important and rewarding decision to quit smoking. A large percentage of smokers have already successfully quit. You can too. You’ve already taken the first smart step by choosing the patch and the HABITROL Take Control® Support Program. The program includes the use of nicotine replacement therapy and behavioral support, a combination that can significantly increase your chances of quitting.</p><p>The patch helps smokers quit smoking by reducing nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Many patch users will be able to stop smoking for at least a few days, but many will start smoking again. Most smokers usually have to try to quit several times before they completely stop.</p><p>Your own chances to stop smoking depend on how strongly you are addicted to nicotine, how much you want to quit, and how closely you follow a quitting program like the one that comes with this product. If you find you cannot stop or if you start smoking again after using this product, please talk to a health care professional who can help you find a program that may work better for you.</p><p>First, there is the 3-step nicotine patch that delivers controlled amounts of nicotine to help reduce your withdrawal cravings for nicotine. The patch utilizes nicotine replacement therapy, and through the use of step-down dosing, gradually reduces the amount of nicotine in your system.</p><p>Second, the HABITROL Take Control® Support Program, developed by behavioral change and smoking cessation experts, recognizes that quitting smoking is a personal journey that occurs in six stages, known as the “Stages of Change.”</p><p>The HABITROL Take Control® Support Program offers the following support elements to help you quit:<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">*If you need a cassette tape instead of the compact disc, please call 1-888-HABITROL.</span></p><p><br/>
<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Working Towards Success</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">— The Stages of Change</span></span><br/>
<br/></p><p>Quitting smoking is a process that begins long before your quit day. Researchers have determined that smokers go through the following six “Stages of Change” while on the road to becoming smoke-free.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Pre-Contemplation Stage:</span></p><p>If you are in this stage, you don’t have any intention to quit smoking in the near future (i.e., within the next 6 months). You feel that the benefits you receive from smoking outweigh the costs and risks of smoking. This is called the <span class="Italics">Pre-Contemplation Stage</span>. If you are in this stage right now, you are not ready to use the patch.</p><p class="First"><br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Contemplation Stage:</span></p><p>After a period of time, often years, you may begin to realize that you are “hooked,” and that smoking is affecting your health and the health of those around you. You begin to think about the benefits of quitting, but you know that quitting will be difficult. You are seriously considering quitting smoking sometime within the next six months, but you are ambivalent. This is called the <span class="Italics">Contemplation Stage</span>. In this stage, you may read articles on ways to quit or on the health effects of smoking, while you would have ignored this information in the <span class="Italics">Pre-Contemplation Stage</span>. You begin to imagine your life without cigarettes. You also begin to experiment with making changes. For example, you may be trying to delay your first cigarette of the day, smoke only half of some cigarettes, or not smoke in your house or car. If you are in this stage right now, you are still not ready to use the patch.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Preparation Stage:</span></p><p>When you’ve made the decision to quit within the next month, and you have experimented with making changes, you’ve entered the <span class="Italics">Preparation Stage</span>. Most people who have purchased the patch for the first time are in this stage. Preparation is a good name for this stage because <span class="Italics">thorough preparation greatly improves your chances of success</span>. Just “winging it” or relying on willpower alone is not enough. <span class="Italics">You need a game plan that includes setting a quit date and committing to at least one person that you will make this change</span>. Using this guide, as well as talking to the professionals at 1-888-HABITROL, will help you become fully prepared for your quit day and beyond.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Action Stage:</span></p><p>On the day that you quit smoking, you are in the <span class="Italics">Action Stage</span>. It’s time to set your plan in motion. You will probably experience cravings for nicotine and urges to have a cigarette throughout the day, but through preparation, you have developed multiple strategies for dealing with your “triggers,” withdrawal symptoms and those cravings or urges to smoke. It’s important to start using the patch on the morning of your quit-day to help reduce urges to smoke and other withdrawal symptoms, such as irritability and difficulty concentrating.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Maintenance and Termination Stages:</span></p><p>If you are able to remain smoke-free for 6 months, you enter the <span class="Italics">Maintenance Stage</span>. You like your new life, but still have occasional urges. Watch out for overconfidence. Thinking you can smoke “just one cigarette” should be a blinking neon warning sign. For most people, that one cigarette leads to two, then three, then full-time smoking again. Constantly remind yourself of the benefits you now enjoy as a nonsmoker. Have a plan ready to help you manage unexpected situations that may cause you stress and challenge your resolve to remain smoke-free. Most successful quitters will have occasional urges for many years.</p><p>Only about 1 in 5 quitters reach the <span class="Italics">Termination Stage</span>, in which they have absolutely no temptation to smoke, and are 100% confident that they will never smoke again.</p><p>Your own chances to stop smoking depend on how strongly you are addicted to nicotine, how much you want to quit, and how closely you follow a quitting program like the one that comes with this product. If you find you cannot stop or if you start smoking again after using this product, please talk to a health care professional who can help you find a program that may work better for you.</p><p>the next 6 months).

<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Why I Want to Stop Smoking</span></span></p><p>Knowing that there are benefits to quitting is essential to your success. Writing down the reasons you want to quit on a card and keeping it with you to review can help you resist a temptation to smoke. Check off the reasons below that apply to you.</p><p><br/></p><p>□ I want control back — I’m almost always thinking about or smoking a cigarette. I feel like the cigarette is controlling me.</p><p>□ I want to improve my chances of living a longer, healthier life.</p><p>□ I want to spend my cigarette money on other things — maybe a vacation.</p><p>□ I want more time for myself. Instead of taking those smoke breaks outside, I could be doing so many other things.</p><p>□ I want to look and smell better by getting rid of that lingering odor of smoke.</p><p>□ I want to set a healthier example for my children and grandchildren.</p><p><br/></p><p>Write other reasons you have for quitting in the space below:</p><p>________________________________________________________</p><p>________________________________________________________</p><p>________________________________________________________</p><p>________________________________________________________</p><p>________________________________________________________</p><p>________________________________________________________</p><p>After completing this list, refer to it every day to reinforce your commitment to becoming a nonsmoker.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Health Benefits of Quitting</span></span></p><p>Most of us recognize the risks of smoking, such as cancer, heart disease and emphysema, but may not be aware of the many immediate and long-term benefits of quitting.</p><p>Immediate benefits in the first days and months may include:</p><p>• Breathing may get easier</p><p>• Food tastes better</p><p>• Sense of smell improves</p><p>• Walking and exercise may become easier</p><p>Remember, it’s never too late to quit. Whether you’re 34 or 84, your body can cleanse and start to repair the damage done by years of smoking.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p>Now that you are motivated and committed, the next step is to choose a quit date within the next 2–3 weeks to stop smoking. Decide whether it will be easier to quit on a workday when your smoking may already be restricted, or on the weekend when you are more relaxed. You may want to consider quitting at the beginning of the week, on a Sunday or Monday. It’s best to choose a date when:</p><p>• Your stress level is low</p><p>• You’ll be confronted with a minimum of smoking triggers</p><p>• You will not be in a social situation with other smokers, especially those that include alcohol</p><p>Enter your quit date on Day 1 of your Daily Success Calendar, located in the back of this guide.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Understanding Nicotine Addiction</span></span></p><p>Dependence on cigarettes is a twofold problem: the physical side of addiction to nicotine and the psychological side. Preparing to deal with both in advance will help make quitting easier and more comfortable.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Smoking and your body</span></span></p><p>As you know, smoking cigarettes is addictive. Nicotine, the addictive agent, reaches your brain in just seconds after each puff. Your brain and body get used to functioning with a certain level of nicotine. Within a few hours of your last cigarette, your nicotine level drops dramatically, resulting in withdrawal symptoms for most smokers.</p><p>Common withdrawal symptoms include intense cravings for nicotine, irritability, anxiety, depression, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, difficulty sleeping and increased appetite. Physical withdrawal symptoms usually peak within 24 to 72 hours after quitting, then decline over the next several weeks. Some smokers, however, may experience withdrawal symptoms for several months.</p><p>Staying on this patch for the full eight weeks can reduce the withdrawal symptoms you experience.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Smoking and your mind</span></span></p><p>The physical need for nicotine isn’t the only reason you may find it difficult to quit smoking. You can also be psychologically dependent.</p><p>Over time you’ve created strong associations or “triggers” to light up a cigarette. Sometimes you smoke for comfort: “Smoking helps me relax,” or “I don’t feel as angry when I smoke.” Sometimes it seems to make a social situation more enjoyable: “I like to smoke when I’m out having coffee with a friend or when drinking at a party.” At other times, you smoke out of habit: “I light up as soon as I get in the car,” “I smoke when I’m taking a break at work” or “Because I am so used to smoking, I feel uncomfortable without a cigarette in my hand.”<br/></p><p class="First"><br/></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Knowing your “triggers”</span></span></p><p>Listed to the right are some of the common situations or activities that “trigger” smoking in many people and some suggestions on how to change your habits in order to reduce your urge to smoke.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Taming Your Triggers</span></span></p><p>Here are some other common “triggers.” Check off the ones that apply to you and write down how you will cope in the spaces below. Also, record other personal “triggers” and the things you plan to do instead.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Reducing the Urge to Smoke</span></span></p><p>Urges to smoke only last for a few seconds to a few minutes.

You might be pleasantly surprised how supportive they can be. If your smoking friends express an interest in quitting, give them our number, 1-888-HABITROL, and we’ll help get them started. You might even choose to quit at the same time so that you can work as a team supporting one another.</p><p>It’s hard for people who have never smoked to understand what you’re going through, both emotionally and physically.

In other words, you “slipped.” This is not a relapse back to smoking. Don’t let this mistake make you feel like a failure or like giving up. Get back on track immediately. Don’t smoke another cigarette. Figure out why you had the slip and how, in the future, you will deal with the people, places or feelings that led to smoking. Do whatever works for you.

When you wear a patch, it gradually releases nicotine into your bloodstream through the skin. By replacing some of the nicotine to which your body has become accustomed from smoking, the patch helps reduce the nicotine withdrawal symptoms many people normally feel when they stop smoking. By offering three patches with different nicotine dose levels, this patch uses a step-down dosing system that allows you to gradually reduce your nicotine level by changing the patch you wear (moving to a lower dose) over an eight-week period. Nicotine replacement therapy can reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, anxiety, restlessness, headaches, difficulty sleeping and concentrating, increased appetite, and craving for nicotine. By helping to reduce your physical nicotine withdrawal symptoms, the patch helps you to concentrate on the psychological aspects of quitting and to change your habits that “trigger” your nicotine cravings.</p><p>This patch program takes 8 weeks to complete, at the end of which you should stop using the patch. It is important that you keep using the patch until you have completed the entire program, and continue to use the HABITROL Take Control® Support Program when you need it.</p><p class="First">It is important that you are firmly committed to giving up smoking.</p><p>Warnings:</p><p class="First">• Have heart disease or an irregular heartbeat, or if you had a recent heart attack.

<span class="Bold"> </span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">1</span>. Choose a clean, dry, non hairy area of skin on your upper body or the outer part of your arm. Do not put a patch on skin that is very oily, burned, broken out, cut or irritated in any way. Immediately before applying the patch, wash your hands and the skin area with plain soap and water and dry completely. Avoid using any soap, lotion, hand cream, tanning lotion or oil, bath oil or insect repellent that contains aloe, lanolin or glycerin as a moisturizer. These products can leave a moisturizing film on your skin, which can interfere with the adherence of the patch.</p><p><span class="Bold">2</span>. Do not remove the patch from its sealed, protective pouch until you are ready to use it. Carefully cut open the child-resistant pouch along the dotted line, as indicated. If the new patch is cut, throw it away. Save pouch to use for patch disposal. Dispose of the used patches by folding sticky ends together and putting in pouch.</p><p></p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">3</span>. A shiny protective liner covers the sticky side of the patch where it contacts the skin. The liner has a precut slit to help you remove it from the patch. With the silver side facing you, pull the liner away from the patch, starting at the precut slit. Hold the patch at the edge (touch the sticky side as little as possible) and pull off the other piece of the protective liner. Throw this liner away.</p><p><span class="Bold">4</span>. Immediately apply the sticky side of the patch to your skin. Press the patch firmly against your skin with the palm of your hand for about 10 seconds. Make sure it sticks well to your skin, especially around the edges.</p><p><span class="Bold">5.</span> When you have finished applying or removing the patch, wash your hands with water only. Nicotine on your hands could get into your eyes and nose and could cause stinging, redness or irritation.</p><p><span class="Bold">6</span>. After 24 hours, remove the patch you have been wearing.</p><p class="First"></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">If you have trouble sleeping<br/></span></span></p><p>You should wear the patch 24 hours a day. This may help overcome your morning cravings for nicotine. However, if you have vivid dreams or other sleep disturbances, you may remove the patch at bedtime and apply a new patch the following morning. The patch should be applied at approximately the same time each day.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">If your patch comes off</span></span><br/></p><p>If your patch falls off, put on a new one.

<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Storage instructions</span></span><br/></p><p>Keep the patch in its protective pouch until you are ready to use it. Store your patches between 20-25°C (68-77°F), because the patch is sensitive to heat. The inside of your car, for example, can reach much higher temperatures in the summer. Keep all unused patches out of the reach of children and pets.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">If your skin reacts to the patch</span></span></p><p><br/></p><p>When you first put on a patch, mild itching, burning, or tingling at the patch application site is normal and should go away within an hour. After you remove a patch, the skin under the patch might be somewhat red. Your skin should not stay red for more than a day. If you have a skin rash or redness caused by the patch that does not go away after 4 days, or your skin swells, call your doctor. Do not put on a new patch; you may be allergic to one of the components of the patch.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Other side effects you may experience</span></span></p><p><br/></p><p>While wearing a nicotine replacement patch, you may experience one or more of the following side effects: nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, diarrhea, nervousness or restlessness, headache, vivid dreams or other sleep disturbances, and irritability.</p><p>If you experience any of the following side effects, immediately remove the patch and call your doctor:</p><p><br/></p><p>• Severe skin irritation or discoloration</p><p>• Irregular heartbeats or palpitations</p><p>• Severe chest pain or tightening</p><p>• Symptoms of nicotine overdose, such as pallor (extreme paleness), cold sweat, nausea, abnormal salivation, vomiting, abdominal pain or severe headache, disturbed hearing or vision, dizziness, mental confusion or weakness.</p><p><br/></p><p class="First"></p><p><br/></p><p class="First">It’s perfectly normal to gain some weight when you stop smoking. But don’t panic. Sometimes the weight change is simply a result of a change in your body’s metabolism. This is caused by your body’s withdrawal from nicotine. Your metabolism is simply returning to that of a nonsmoker. Besides, the average weight gain is only about five to ten pounds, and as you will see, there are things you can do to help control it.</p><p><br/></p><p>Another source of extra pounds is the need for oral gratification.
