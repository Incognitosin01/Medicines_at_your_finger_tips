</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hepatotoxicity<br/>
General Population: Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate and its derivatives. These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those on multiple anticonvulsants, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease. When divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules are used in this patient group, they should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. The incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Mitochondrial Disease: There is an increased risk of valproate-induced acute liver failure and resultant deaths in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by DNA mutations of the mitochondrial DNA Polymerase Î³ (POLG) gene (e.g. Alpers Huttenlocher Syndrome). Divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules are contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. In patients over two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a hereditary mitochondrial disease, divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules should only be used after other anticonvulsants have failed. This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver testing. POLG mutation screening should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Fetal Risk</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Valproate can cause major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida). In addition, valproate can cause decreased IQ scores and neurodevelopmental disorders following in utero exposure.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Valproate is therefore contraindicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in pregnant women and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. In such situations, effective contraception should be used <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4)]</span>.<br/></span></p><p><span class="Bold">A Medication Guide describing the risks of valproate is available for patients <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Pancreatitis<br/>
Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate. Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with a rapid progression from initial symptoms to death. Cases have been reported shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. If pancreatitis is diagnosed, valproate should ordinarily be discontinued. Alternative treatment for the underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</span></p><h2>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h2><h3>Epilepsy</h3><p class="First">Divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules are indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years with complex partial seizures that occur either in isolation or in association with other types of seizures. Divalproex sodium delayed-release capsule are also indicated for use as sole and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of simple and complex absence seizures, and adjunctively in patients with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures.</p><p>Simple absence is defined as very brief clouding of the sensorium or loss of consciousness accompanied by certain generalized epileptic discharges without other detectable clinical signs. Complex absence is the term used when other signs are also present.</p><h3>Important Limitations</h3><p class="First">Because of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, neural tube defects, and other major congenital malformations, which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3,5.4),</span><span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></p><p>For prophylaxis of migraine headaches, valproate is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h2>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h2><h3>Epilepsy</h3><p class="First">Divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules are administered orally. As divalproex sodium dosage is titrated upward, concentrations of clonazepam, diazepam, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, tolbutamide, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and/or phenytoin may be affected <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Complex Partial Seizures</span></p><p>For adults and children 10 years of age or older.</p><p><span class="Bold">Monotherapy (Initial Therapy)</span></p><p>Divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules have not been systematically studied as initial therapy. Patients should initiate therapy at 10 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 mg/kg/week to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 mcg/mL to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.</p><p>The probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma concentrations above 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males. The benefit of improved seizure control with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.</p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion to Monotherapy</span></p><p>Patients should initiate therapy at 10 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 mg/kg/week to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 mcg/mL to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.</p><p>Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adjunctive Therapy</span></p><p>Divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 mg/kg/week to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 mcg/mL to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.</p><p>In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Simple and Complex Absence Seizures</span></p><p>The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 mg/kg/day to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.</p><p>A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentrations for most patients with absence seizures are considered to range from 50 mcg/mL to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12.3)]</span>.</p><p>As the divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7.2)]</span>.</p><p>Antiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life.</p><p>In epileptic patients previously receiving valproic acid therapy, divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules should be initiated at the same daily dose and dosing schedule. After the patient is stabilized on divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules, a dosing schedule of two or three times a day may be elected in selected patients.</p><h3>General Dosing Advice</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dosing in Elderly Patients</span></p><p>Due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence in the elderly, the starting dose should be reduced in these patients. Dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.14), Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dose-Related Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>The frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be dose-related. The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of greater than or equal to 110 mcg/mL (females) or greater than or equal to 135 mcg/mL (males) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.8)]</span>. The benefit of improved therapeutic effect with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.</p><p><span class="Bold">G.I. Irritation</span></p><p>Patients who experience G.I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by slowly building up the dose from an initial low level.</p><p><span class="Bold">Administration of Sprinkle Capsules</span></p><p>Divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules may be swallowed whole or may be administered by carefully opening the capsule and sprinkling the entire contents on a small amount (teaspoonful) of soft food such as applesauce or pudding. The drug/food mixture should be swallowed immediately (avoid chewing) and not stored for future use. Each capsule is oversized to allow ease of opening.</p><h3>Dosing in Patients Taking Rufinamide</h3><p class="First">Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7.2)]</span>.</p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS &amp; STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First">Divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules, USP (sprinkle)are for oral administration. Divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules, USP (sprinkle)contain specially coated particles of divalproex sodium equivalent to 125 mg of valproic acid in a hard gelatin capsule.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General Information on Hepatotoxicity</span></p><p>Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate. These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months of valproate therapy. However, healthcare providers should not rely totally on serum biochemistry since these tests may not be abnormal in all instances, but should also consider the results of careful interim medical history and physical examination.</p><p>Caution should be observed when administering valproate products to patients with a prior history of hepatic disease. Patients on multiple anticonvulsants, children, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease may be at particular risk. See below, âPatients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease.â</p><p>Experience has indicated that children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions. When divalproex sodium is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. In progressively older patient groups experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease</span></p><p>Divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules are contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics">4)]</span>. Valproate-induced acute liver failure and liver-related deaths have been reported in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by mutations in the gene for mitochondrial DNA polymerase Î³ (POLG) (e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) at a higher rate than those without these syndromes. Most of the reported cases of liver failure in patients with these syndromes have been identified in children and adolescents.</p><p>POLG-related disorders should be suspected in patients with a family history or suggestive symptoms of a POLG-related disorder, including but not limited to unexplained encephalopathy, refractory epilepsy (focal, myoclonic), status epilepticus at presentation, developmental delays, psychomotor regression, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, myopathy cerebellar ataxia, opthalmoplegia, or complicated migraine with occipital aura. POLG mutation testing should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice for the diagnostic evaluation of such disorders. The A467T and W748S mutations are present in approximately 2/3 of patients with autosomal recessive POLG-related disorders.</p><p>In patients over two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a hereditary mitochondrial disease, divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules should only be used after other anticonvulsants have failed. This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver test monitoring.</p><p>The drug should be discontinued immediately in the presence of significant hepatic dysfunction, suspected or apparent. In some cases, hepatic dysfunction has progressed in spite of discontinuation of drug <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics">4)]</span>.</p><h3>Structural Birth Defects</h3><p class="First">Valproate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy registry data show that maternal valproate use can cause neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to mothers using valproate is about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers using other anti-seizure monotherapies. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><h3>Decreased IQ Following in utero Exposure</h3><p class="First">Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following <span class="Italics">in utero</span> exposure. Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate <span class="Italics">in utero</span> have lower cognitive test scores than children exposed <span class="Italics">in utero</span> to either another antiepileptic drug or to no antiepileptic drugs. The largest of these studies<span class="Sup">1</span> is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n=62) had lower IQ scores at age 6 (97 [95% C.I. 94 to 101]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine (108 [95% C.I. 105 to 110]), carbamazepine (105 [95% C.I. 102 to 108]), and phenytoin (108 [95% C.I. 104 to 112]). It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproate-exposed children occur. Because the women in this study were exposed to antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to a particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed.</p><p>Although all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that valproate exposure <span class="Italics">in utero</span> can cause decreased IQ in children.</p><p>In animal studies, offspring with prenatal exposure to valproate had malformations similar to those seen in humans and demonstrated neurobehavioral deficits <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Use in Women of Childbearing Potential</h3><p class="First">Because of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, and major congenital malformations (including neural tube defects), which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death such as prophylaxis of migraine headaches <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Women should use effective contraception while using valproate.</p><p>Women of childbearing potential should be counseled regularly regarding the relative risks and benefits of valproate use during pregnancy. This is especially important for women planning a pregnancy and for girls at the onset of puberty; alternative therapeutic options should be considered for these patients <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p>To prevent major seizures, valproate should not be discontinued abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life.</p><p>Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population. It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation. Dietary folic acid supplementation both prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients using valproate.</p><h3>Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate. Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with rapid progression from initial symptoms to death. Some cases have occurred shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use. The rate based upon the reported cases exceeds that expected in the general population and there have been cases in which pancreatitis recurred after rechallenge with valproate. In clinical trials, there were 2 cases of pancreatitis without alternative etiology in 2,416 patients, representing 1,044 patient-years experience. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. If pancreatitis is diagnosed, divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules should ordinarily be discontinued. Alternative treatment for the underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning]</span>.</p><h3>Urea Cycle Disorders</h3><p class="First">Divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules is contraindicated in patients with known urea cycle disorders (UCD).<br/>
Hyperammonemic encephalopathy, sometimes fatal, has been reported following initiation of valproate therapy in patients with urea cycle disorders, a group of uncommon genetic abnormalities, particularly ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Prior to the initiation of divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules therapy, evaluation for UCD should be considered in the following patients: 1) those with a history of unexplained encephalopathy or coma, encephalopathy associated with a protein load, pregnancy-related or postpartum encephalopathy, unexplained mental retardation, or history of elevated plasma ammonia or glutamine; 2) those with cyclical vomiting and lethargy, episodic extreme irritability, ataxia, low BUN, or protein avoidance; 3) those with a family history of UCD or a family history of unexplained infant deaths (particularly males); 4) those with other signs or symptoms of UCD. Patients who develop symptoms of unexplained hyperammonemic encephalopathy while receiving valproate therapy should receive prompt treatment (including discontinuation of valproate therapy) and be evaluated for underlying urea cycle disorders <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics">4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].</span></p><h3>Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</h3><p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p><p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p><p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p><p>Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p><p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.</p><p>Anyone considering prescribing divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p><h3>Bleeding and Other Hematopoietic Disorders</h3><p class="First">Valproate is associated with dose-related thrombocytopenia. In a clinical trial of valproate as monotherapy in patients with epilepsy, 34/126 patients (27%) receiving approximately 50 mg/kg/day on average, had at least one value of platelets less than or equal to 75 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L. Approximately half of these patients had treatment discontinued, with return of platelet counts to normal. In the remaining patients, platelet counts normalized with continued treatment. In this study, the probability of thrombocytopenia appeared to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of greater than or equal to 110 mcg/mL (females) or greater than or equal to 135 mcg/mL (males). The therapeutic benefit which may accompany the higher doses should therefore be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse effects. Valproate use has also been associated with decreases in other cell lines and myelodysplasia.</p><p>Because of reports of cytopenias, inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation, and abnormal coagulation parameters, (e.g., low fibrinogen, coagulation factor deficiencies, acquired von Willebrandâs disease), measurements of complete blood counts and coagulation tests are recommended before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals. It is recommended that patients receiving divalproex sodium be monitored for blood counts and coagulation parameters prior to planned surgery and during pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.1)]</span>. Evidence of hemorrhage, bruising, or a disorder of hemostasis/coagulation is an indication for reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of therapy.</p><h3>Hyperammonemia</h3><p class="First">Hyperammonemia has been reported in association with valproate therapy and may be present despite normal liver function tests. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy and vomiting or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured. Hyperammonemia should also be considered in patients who present with hypothermia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions</span> <span class="Italics">(5.11)]</span>. If ammonia is increased, valproate therapy should be discontinued. Appropriate interventions for treatment of hyperammonemia should be initiated, and such patients should undergo investigation for underlying urea cycle disorders <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics">4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.10)]</span>.</p><p>Asymptomatic elevations of ammonia are more common and when present, require close monitoring of plasma ammonia levels. If the elevation persists, discontinuation of valproate therapy should be considered.</p><h3>Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy Associated with Concomitant Topiramate Use</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration of topiramate and valproate has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting. Hypothermia can also be a manifestation of hyperammonemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.11)]</span>. In most cases, symptoms and signs abated with discontinuation of either drug. This adverse reaction is not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction. Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, an interaction of topiramate and valproate may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics">4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.9)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypothermia</h3><p class="First">Hypothermia, defined as an unintentional drop in body core temperature to less than 35Â°C (95Â°F), has been reported in association with valproate therapy both in conjunction with and in the absence of hyperammonemia. This adverse reaction can also occur in patients using concomitant topiramate with valproate after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7.3)]</span>. Consideration should be given to stopping valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels.</p><h3>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking valproate. DRESS may be fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Valproate should be discontinued and not be resumed if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.</p><h3>Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics</h3><p class="First">Carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list) may reduce serum valproate concentrations to subtherapeutic levels, resulting in loss of seizure control. Serum valproate concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproate concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Somnolence in the Elderly</h3><p class="First">In a double-blind, multicenter trial of valproate in elderly patients with dementia (mean age = 83 years), doses were increased by 125 mg/day to a target dose of 20 mg/kg/day. A significantly higher proportion of valproate patients had somnolence compared to placebo, and although not statistically significant, there was a higher proportion of patients with dehydration. Discontinuations for somnolence were also significantly higher than with placebo. In some patients with somnolence (approximately one-half), there was associated reduced nutritional intake and weight loss. There was a trend for the patients who experienced these events to have a lower baseline albumin concentration, lower valproate clearance, and a higher BUN. In elderly patients, dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Monitoring: Drug Plasma Concentration</h3><p class="First">Since valproate may interact with concurrently administered drugs which are capable of enzyme induction, periodic plasma concentration determinations of valproate and concomitant drugs are recommended during the early course of therapy <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7)]</span>.</p><h3>Effect on Ketone and Thyroid Function Tests</h3><p class="First">Valproate is partially eliminated in the urine as a keto-metabolite which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test.</p><p>There have been reports of altered thyroid function tests associated with valproate. The clinical significance of these is unknown.</p><h3>Effect on HIV and CMV Viruses Replication</h3><p class="First">There are <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies that suggest valproate stimulates the replication of the HIV and CMV viruses under certain experimental conditions. The clinical consequence, if any, is not known. Additionally, the relevance of these <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> findings is uncertain for patients receiving maximally suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Nevertheless, these data should be borne in mind when interpreting the results from regular monitoring of the viral load in HIV infected patients receiving valproate or when following CMV infected patients clinically.</p><h3>Medication Residue in the Stool</h3><p class="First">There have been rare reports of medication residue in the stool. Some patients have had anatomic (including ileostomy or colostomy) or functional gastrointestinal disorders with shortened GI transit times. In some reports, medication residues have occurred in the context of diarrhea. It is recommended that plasma valproate levels be checked in patients who experience medication residue in the stool, and patientsâ clinical condition should be monitored. If clinically indicated, alternative treatment may be considered.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate. Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.</p><p>In contrast, drugs that are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 isozymes, e.g., antidepressants, may be expected to have little effect on valproate clearance because cytochrome P450 microsomal mediated oxidation is a relatively minor secondary metabolic pathway compared to glucuronidation and beta-oxidation.</p><p>Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations should be increased whenever enzyme inducing drugs are introduced or withdrawn.</p><p>The following list provides information about the potential for an influence of several commonly prescribed medications on valproate pharmacokinetics. The list is not exhaustive nor could it be, since new interactions are continuously being reported.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Aspirin</span></p><p>A study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 mg/kg to 16 mg/kg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n=6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate. Valproate free fraction was increased 4-fold in the presence of aspirin compared to valproate alone. The Î²-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-keto valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3% in the presence of aspirin. Caution should be observed if valproate and aspirin are to be co-administered.</p><p><span class="Italics">Carbapenem Antibiotics</span></p><p>A clinically significant reduction in serum valproic acid concentration has been reported in patients receiving carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list) and may result in loss of seizure control. The mechanism of this interaction is not well understood. Serum valproic acid concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy.

Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received. Concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline has rarely been associated with toxicity. Monitoring of amitriptyline levels should be considered for patients taking valproate concomitantly with amitriptyline.

Over the age of 10 years, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults.

Efficacy was not established for either the treatment of migraine or the treatment of mania. The most common drug-related adverse reactions (reported greater than 5% and twice the rate of placebo) reported in the controlled pediatric mania study were nausea, upper abdominal pain, somnolence, increased ammonia, gastritis and rash.</p><p>The remaining five trials were long term safety studies. Two six-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets for the indication of mania (292 patients aged 10 to 17 years). Two twelve-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets for the indication of migraine (353 patients aged 12 to 17 years).

The mechanisms by which valproate exerts its therapeutic effects have not been established. It has been suggested that its activity in epilepsy is related to increased brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The relationship between plasma concentration and clinical response is not well documented. One contributing factor is the nonlinear, concentration dependent protein binding of valproate which affects the clearance of the drug. Thus, monitoring of total serum valproate may not provide a reliable index of the bioactive valproate species.</p><p>For example, because the plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent, the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL. Higher than expected free fractions occur in the elderly, in hyperlipidemic patients, and in patients with hepatic and renal diseases.</p><p><span class="Bold">Epilepsy</span></p><p>The therapeutic range in epilepsy is commonly considered to be 50 mcg/mL to 100 mcg/mL of total valproate, although some patients may be controlled with lower or higher plasma concentrations.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption/Bioavailability</span></p><p>Equivalent oral doses of divalproex sodium products and valproic acid capsules deliver equivalent quantities of valproate ion systemically. Although the rate of valproate ion absorption may vary with the formulation administered (liquid, solid, or sprinkle), conditions of use (e.g., fasting or postprandial) and the method of administration (e.g., whether the contents of the capsule are sprinkled on food or the capsule is taken intact), these differences should be of minor clinical importance under the steady state conditions achieved in chronic use in the treatment of epilepsy.</p><p>However, it is possible that differences among the various valproate products in T<span class="Sub">max</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> could be important upon initiation of treatment. For example, in single dose studies, the effect of feeding had a greater influence on the rate of absorption of the tablet (increase in T<span class="Sub">max</span> from 4 to 8 hours) than on the absorption of the sprinkle capsules (increase in T<span class="Sub">max</span> from 3.3 to 4.8 hours).</p><p>While the absorption rate from the G.I. tract and fluctuation in valproate plasma concentrations vary with dosing regimen and formulation, the efficacy of valproate as an anticonvulsant in chronic use is unlikely to be affected. Experience employing dosing regimens from once-a-day to four-times-a-day, as well as studies in primate epilepsy models involving constant rate infusion, indicate that total daily systemic bioavailability (extent of absorption) is the primary determinant of seizure control and that differences in the ratios of plasma peak to trough concentrations between valproate formulations are inconsequential from a practical clinical standpoint.</p><p>Co-administration of oral valproate products with food and substitution among the various divalproex sodium and valproic acid formulations should cause no clinical problems in the management of patients with epilepsy <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Protein Binding</span></p><p>The plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent and the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL. Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin). Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">7</span>)</span> for more detailed information on the pharmacokinetic interactions of valproate with other drugs<span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">CNS Distribution</span></p><p>Valproate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) approximate unbound concentrations in plasma (about 10% of total concentration).</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Valproate is metabolized almost entirely by the liver. In adult patients on monotherapy, 30 to 50% of an administered dose appears in urine as a glucuronide conjugate. Mitochondrial Î²-oxidation is the other major metabolic pathway, typically accounting for over 40% of the dose. Usually, less than 15 to 20% of the dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms. Less than 3% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine.</p><p>The relationship between dose and total valproate concentration is nonlinear; concentration does not increase proportionally with the dose, but rather, increases to a lesser extent due to saturable plasma protein binding. The kinetics of unbound drug are linear.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for total valproate are 0.56 L/hr/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> and 11 L/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively. Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free valproate are 4.6 L/hr/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> and 92 L/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>. Mean terminal half-life for valproate monotherapy ranged from 9 to 16 hours following oral dosing regimens of 250 mg to 1,000 mg.</p><p>The estimates cited apply primarily to patients who are not taking drugs that affect hepatic metabolizing enzyme systems. For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly. Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of antiepileptic concentrations should be intensified whenever concomitant antiepileptics are introduced or withdrawn.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Age</span></p><p>Children</p><p>Pediatric patients (i.e., between 3 months and 10 years) have 50% higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e., mL/min/kg) than do adults.

In that study, the half-life of valproate was increased from 12 to 18 hours. Liver disease is also associated with decreased albumin concentrations and larger unbound fractions (2 to 2.6 fold increase) of valproate. Accordingly, monitoring of total concentrations may be misleading since free concentrations may be substantially elevated in patients with hepatic disease whereas total concentrations may appear to be normal <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Italics">Boxed Warning</span>, Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">4</span>), and Warnings and Precautions (<span class="Italics">5.1</span>)]</span>.</p><p>Renal Disease</p><p>A slight reduction (27%) in the unbound clearance of valproate has been reported in patients with renal failure (creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/minute); however, hemodialysis typically reduces valproate concentrations by about 20%. Therefore, no dosage adjustment appears to be necessary in patients with renal failure. Protein binding in these patients is substantially reduced; thus, monitoring total concentrations may be misleading.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>Valproate was administered orally to rats and mice at doses of 80 mg/kg/day and 170 mg/kg/day (less than the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) for two years.

A positive percent reduction indicates an improvement (i.e., a decrease in seizure frequency), while a negative percent reduction indicates worsening. Thus, in a display of this type, the curve for an effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for placebo. This figure shows that the proportion of patients achieving any particular level of improvement was consistently higher for valproate than for placebo. For example, 45% of patients treated with valproate had a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in complex partial seizure rate compared to 23% of patients treated with placebo.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>The second study assessed the capacity of valproate to reduce the incidence of CPS when administered as the sole AED.

Patients entering the randomized phase were then brought to their assigned target dose, gradually tapered off their concomitant AED and followed for an interval as long as 22 weeks. Less than 50% of the patients randomized, however, completed the study.

Thus, in a display of this type, the curve for a more effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for a less effective treatment. This Figure shows that the proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction was consistently higher for high dose valproate than for low dose valproate. For example, when switching from carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital or primidone monotherapy to high dose valproate monotherapy, 63% of patients experienced no change or a reduction in complex partial seizure rates compared to 54% of patients receiving low dose valproate.</p><p>Figure 2</p><p>Information on pediatric studies is presented in section 8.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Divalproex sodium delayed-release capsules, USP (sprinkle), for oral use 125 mg, are blue transparent/white opaque size â0â hard gelatin capsules, filled with white to off-white colored pellets.
