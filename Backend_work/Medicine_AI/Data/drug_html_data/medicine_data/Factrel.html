</ul><p>Pharmacologic Class: Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Agonist</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Factrel</h2><p>Gonadorelin is a medicine that is the same as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) that is naturally released from the hypothalamus gland. GnRH causes the pituitary gland to release other hormones (luteinizing hormone [LH] and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]). LH and FSH control development in children and fertility in adults.</p><p>Gonadorelin is used to test how well the hypothalamus and the pituitary glands are working. It is also used to cause ovulation (release of an egg from the ovary) in women who do not have regular ovulation and menstrual periods because the hypothalamus gland does not release enough GnRH.</p><p>Gonadorelin may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Factrel</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

The medicine has not caused different side effects or problems in children 12 years of age and older than it does in adults. Children up to 12 years of age may not be sensitive to the effects of gonadorelin. Infants may be very sensitive to the effects of gonadorelin and use in infants is not recommended.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone adenoma—Although this condition is rare, use of gonadorelin when this condition exists may cause problems in the pituitary gland and could result in sudden blindness</li>
<li>Any condition that may be made worse by estrogens, progestins, or androgens, such as a hormone-dependent tumor—The increase of estrogens and progestins in women or androgens in men that can result from use of multiple doses of gonadorelin may make a tumor worse if the tumor depends on estrogens, progestins, or androgens for growth</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Factrel</h2><p>If you are having a test done with gonadorelin, one or more samples of your blood will be taken. Then gonadorelin is given by an intravenous (into a vein) or a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. At regular times after the medicine is given, more blood samples will be taken. Then the results of the test will be studied.</p><p>Some medicines given by injection or by injection pump may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital. If you are using this medicine at home, make sure you clearly understand and carefully follow your doctor's instructions.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
