moderate to moderately severe pain.<br/>
<br/></p><p class="First">The most frequently reported adverse reactions are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation,<br/>
nausea and vomiting. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory than in<br/>
nonambulatory patients, and some of these adverse reactions may be alleviated if the<br/>
patient lies down.<br/>
<br/>
Other adverse reactions include:<br/>
Central Nervous System: Drowsiness, mental clouding, lethargy, impairment of mental<br/>
and physical performance, anxiety, fear, dysphoria, psychic dependence, mood changes.<br/>
<br/>
Gastrointestinal System: Prolonged administration of hydrocodone bitartrate and<br/>
acetaminophen tablets may produce constipation. <span class="Bold"><br/>
<br/></span> Genitourinary System: Ureteral spasm, spasm of vesical sphincters and urinary retention<br/>
have been reported with opiates.<br/>
<br/>
Respiratory Depression: Hydrocodone bitartrate may produce dose-related respiratory<br/>
depression by acting directly on brain stem respiratory centers (see OVERDOSAGE). <span class="Bold"><br/>
<br/></span> Special Senses: Cases of hearing impairment or permanent loss have been reported<br/>
predominantly in patients with chronic overdose.<br/>
<br/>
Dermatological: Skin rash, pruritus.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/></span> The following adverse drug events may be borne in mind as potential effects of acetaminophen:<br/>
allergic reactions, rash, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis.<br/>
<br/>
Potential effects of high dosage are listed in the OVERDOSAGE section.<br/>
<br/>
<br/></p><p class="First">Controlled Substance: Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets are<br/>
classified as a Schedule III controlled substance.<br/>
<br/>
Abuse and Dependence: Psychic dependence, physical dependence, and tolerance<br/>
may develop upon repeated administration of narcotics; therefore, this product should<br/>
be prescribed and administered with caution. However, psychic dependence is unlikely<br/>
to develop when hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets are used for a short<br/>
time for the treatment of pain.<br/>
<br/>
Physical dependence, the condition in which continued administration of the drug is required<br/>
to prevent the appearance of a withdrawal syndrome, assumes clinically significant proportions<br/>
only after several weeks of continued narcotic use, although some mild degree of physical<br/>
dependence may develop after a few days of narcotic therapy. Tolerance, in which increasingly<br/>
large doses are required in order to produce the same degree of analgesia, is manifested initially<br/>
by a shortened duration of analgesic effect, and subsequently by decreases in the intensity of<br/>
analgesia. The rate of development of tolerance varies among patients.<br/>

Convenience Pack</p><p>Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen: Why is this medication prescribed?</p><p>Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen is a combination of a narcotic (hydrocodone) and a non-narcotic (acetaminophen)<br/>
used to relieve moderate to severe pain. Hydrocodone works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal<br/>
cord, and acetaminophen decreases the formation of prostaglandins, therefore relieving pain.</p><p>Theramine: Why is this medication prescribed?</p><p>Theramine is a Medical Food product designed to aid in the nutritional management of pain syndromes.</p><p>Theramine stimulates production of serotonin, GABA, norepinephrine, nitric oxide, and acetylcholine, the<br/>
neurotransmitters that are involved in pain disorders. If the timing and secretion of these neurotransmitters are<br/>
effectively modulated, acute, and chronic pain disorders are more effectively managed. Theramine provides L-<br/>
arginine at a low dose along with choline and L-glutamine to inhibit the NMDA and opioid receptors.</p><p>Theramine aids in the nutritional management of serotonin, GABA, and acetylcholine production deficiencies in<br/>
patients with pain sydromes</p><p>NDC Number 68405-298-36<br/></p><p class="First"></p><h2>More about Theracodophen Low 90 (acetaminophen / hydrocodone)</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
