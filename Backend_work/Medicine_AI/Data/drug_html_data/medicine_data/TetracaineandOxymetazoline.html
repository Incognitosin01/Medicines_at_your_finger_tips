Administer ipsilateral (same side) to the maxillary tooth on which the dental procedure will be performed. Wait 10 minutes following administration to perform a test drill to confirm that the tooth involved is anesthetized. Avoid use with other intranasal products, including other oxymetazoline-containing nasal sprays. Discontinue oxymetazoline-containing products 24 hours prior to administration of tetracaine/oxymetazoline.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store between 2°C and 8°C (36°F and 46°F); excursions permitted between 0°C and 15°C (32°F and 59°F).

Avoid use in patients with a history of frequent nose bleeds (≥5 per month); if administration cannot be avoided, monitor patients with frequent nose bleeds carefully.</p><p>• Hypertension: May occur; monitor patients for increased blood pressure. Use is not recommended in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.</p><p>• Methemoglobinemia: Has been reported with local anesthetics; clinically significant methemoglobinemia requires immediate treatment along with discontinuation of the anesthetic and other oxidizing agents. Onset may be immediate or delayed (hours) after anesthetic exposure. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites, or infants &lt;6 months of age are more susceptible and should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia (eg, cyanosis, headache, rapid pulse, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, fatigue).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Patients with severe hepatic impairment may be at greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations of tetracaine due to inability to metabolize local anesthetics. Monitor patients with hepatic disease for signs of local anesthetic toxicity.</p><p>• Pseudocholinesterase deficiency: Patients with pseudocholinesterase deficiency may be at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations of tetracaine due to inability to metabolize local anesthetics. Monitor for signs of local anesthetic toxicity.</p><p>• Thyroid disease: Use is not recommended in patients with inadequately controlled active thyroid disease.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension and cardiovascular collapse (AAP 1997; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol with caution in neonates. See manufacturer′s labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Avoid use with other intranasal products, including other oxymetazoline-containing nasal sprays. Discontinue oxymetazoline-containing products 24 hours prior to administration of tetracaine/oxymetazoline.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Blood pressure; monitor for dysphagia, epistaxis, and signs of local anesthetic toxicity, especially in patients with hepatic impairment or pseudocholinesterase deficiency.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Adverse events have been observed in some animal reproduction studies using this combination subcutaneously.
