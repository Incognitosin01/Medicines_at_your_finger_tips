However, there are studies in the literature that report the inhibition of ODC activity in skin following oral eflornithine. It is postulated that topical eflornithine hydrochloride irreversibly inhibits skin ODC activity. This enzyme is necessary in the synthesis of polyamines. Animal data indicate that inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase inhibits cell division and synthetic functions, which affect the rate of hair growth. <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> (eflornithine hydrochloride) cream, 13.9% has been shown to retard the rate of hair growth in non-clinical and clinical studies.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The mean percutaneous absorption of eflornithine in women with unwanted facial hair, from a 13.9% w/w cream formulation, is less than 1% of the radioactive dose, following either single or multiple doses under conditions of clinical use, that included shaving within 2 hours before radiolabeled dose application in addition to other forms of cutting or plucking, and tweezing to remove facial hair. Steady state was reached within four days of twice-daily application. The apparent steady-state plasma t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> of eflornithine was approximately 8 hours. Following twice-daily application of 0.5 g of the cream (total dose 1 g/day; 139 mg as anhydrous eflornithine hydrochloride), under conditions of clinical use in women with unwanted facial hair (n=10), the steady-state Cmax, Ctrough and AUC<span class="Sub">12hr</span> were approximately 10 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL, and 92 ng•hr/mL, respectively, expressed in terms of the anhydrous free base of eflornithine hydrochloride. At steady state, the dose-normalized peak concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and the extent of daily systemic exposure (AUC) of eflornithine following twice-daily application of 0.5 g of the cream (total dose 1 g/day) is estimated to be approximately 100- and 60-fold lower, when compared to 370 mg/day once-daily oral doses. This compound is not known to be metabolized and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span><span class="Sup"> </span>(eflornithine hydrochloride) cream, 13.9% is indicated for the reduction of unwanted facial hair in women.</p><p><span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> has only been studied on the face and adjacent involved areas under the chin of affected individuals. Usage should be limited to these areas of involvement.</p><h2>Clinical Trials</h2><p class="First">Results of topical dermal studies for contact sensitization, photocontact sensitization, and photocontact irritation reveal that under conditions of clinical use, <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is not expected to cause contact sensitization, phototoxic, or photosensitization reactions. Results of the topical dermal study for contact irritation did reveal that <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> could cause irritation reactions in clinical use in susceptible individuals or under conditions of exaggerated use.</p><p>Two randomized double-blind studies involving 594 female patients (393 treated with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>, 201 with vehicle) treated twice daily for up to 24 weeks evaluated the efficacy of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> in the reduction of unwanted facial hair in women. Women in the trial had a customary frequency of removal of facial hair two or more times per week. Women with facial conditions such as severe inflammatory acne, women who were pregnant, and nursing mothers were excluded from the studies. Physicians assessed the improvement or worsening from the baseline condition (Physician's Global Assessment [PGA]), 48 hours after shaving, of all treated areas. Statistically significant improvement for <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> (eflornithine hydrochloride) cream, 13.9% versus vehicle was seen in each of these studies for "marked improvement" or greater response (24-week time point; p≤ 0.001). Marked improvement was seen consistently at 8 weeks after initiation of treatment and continued throughout the 24 weeks of treatment. Hair growth approached pretreatment levels within 8 weeks of treatment withdrawal. The success rate over time is graphically presented below for each pivotal trial.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Approximately 32% of patients showed marked improvement or greater (protocol definition of clinical success) after 24 weeks of treatment with VANIQA<span class="Sup">®</span> (eflornithine hydrochloride) cream, 13.9%, compared to 8% with the vehicle. Combined results of these two trials through 24 weeks are presented below.</p><p>Subgroup analyses appeared to suggest greater benefit for Whites than non-Whites (37% versus 22% success, respectively; p=0.017). However, non-Whites, mostly Black subjects, did have significant treatment benefit with 22% graded as success on VANIQA<span class="Sup">®</span> compared to 5% on vehicle.</p><p>About 12% of women in the clinical trials were postmenopausal. Significant improvement in PGA outcome versus vehicle was seen in postmenopausal women (38% compared to 0%, p≤ 0.001).</p><p><span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span><span class="Bold"> </span>statistically significantly reduced how bothered patients felt by their facial hair and by the time spent removing, treating, or concealing facial hair. These patient-observable differences were seen as early as 8 weeks after initiating treatment. Hair growth approached pretreatment levels within 8 weeks of treatment withdrawal.</p><p>Clinical trials with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> involved over 1370 women with unwanted facial hair of skin types I-VI, of whom 68% were White, 17% Black, 11% Hispanic-Latino, 2% Asian-Pacific Islander, 0.6% American Native, and 1.3% other.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is contraindicated in patients with a history of sensitivity to any components of the preparation.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Discontinue use if hypersensitivity occurs.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For external use only.</span><br/></p><p>Transient stinging or burning may occur when applied to abraded or broken skin.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients using <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> should receive the following information and instructions:</p><p>Refer to the Patient Information Leaflet for additional important information and instructions.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">It is not known if <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> has any interaction with other topically applied drug products.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">In a 12-month photocarcinogenicity study in hairless albino mice, animals treated with the vehicle alone showed an increased incidence of skin tumors induced by exposure to ultraviolet (UVA/UVB) light, whereas mice treated topically with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> at doses up to 600 mg/kg [19X the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (BSA)] showed an incidence of skin tumors equivalent to untreated-control animals.</p><p>A 2-year dermal carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice treated with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span><span class="Sup"> </span>revealed no evidence of carcinogenicity at daily doses up to 600 mg/kg (950X the MRHD based on AUC comparisons).</p><p>Eflornithine did not elicit mutagenic effects in an Ames reverse-mutation assay or clastogenicity in primary human lymphocytes, with and without metabolic activation. In a dermal micronucleus assay, eflornithine hydrochloride cream, 13.9%, at doses up to 900 mg/kg (58X the MRHD based on BSA) in rats yielded no evidence of genotoxicity.</p><p>In a dermal fertility and early embryonic development study in rats treated with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>, there were no adverse reproductive effects at doses up to 450 mg/kg (29X the MRHD based on BSA). In a peri- and postnatal study in rats, eflornithine administered in the drinking water was associated with maternal toxicity and reduced pup weights at doses of at least 625 mg/kg (40X the MRHD based on BSA) and a slightly reduced fertility index, which was considered to be of questionable biological significance, at 1698 mg/kg (110X the MRHD based on BSA). No effects were seen with an oral dose of 223 mg/kg (14X the MRHD based on BSA). In the latter study, the multiples of the human exposure are likely much higher, since eflornithine is well absorbed orally in rats, whereas minimal absorption occurs in humans treated topically.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects</span></p><p>In the first dermal embryo-fetal development study in rats treated with eflornithine hydrochloride cream, 13.9% (in which no precautions were taken to prevent ingestion of drug from application sites), maternal toxicity and fetal effects including reduced numbers of live fetuses, decreased fetal weights, and delayed ossification and development of the viscera were observed at doses of 225 and 450 mg/kg (15X and 29X the MRHD based on BSA, respectively). When the study was repeated under conditions that avoided ingestion from application sites, no maternal, fetal or teratogenic effects were observed at doses up to 450 mg/kg (29X the MRHD based on BSA). In the first study in which no precautions were taken to prevent ingestion, circulating plasma levels were 11- to 14-fold higher than in the second study in which ingestion was prevented. In a dermal embryo-fetal development study in rabbits treated with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span><span class="Sup"> </span>(eflornithine hydrochloride) cream, 13.9% no adverse maternal or fetal effects occurred at doses up to 90 mg/kg (11X the MRHD based on BSA). Significant dermal irritation, as well as possible ingestion of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span><span class="Sup"> </span>occurred at 300 mg/kg/day (36X the MRHD based on BSA) and was associated with maternal deaths, abortions, increased fetal resorptions, and reduced fetal weights. Fetotoxicity in the absence of maternal toxicity has been reported in oral studies with eflornithine with fetal no-effect doses of 80 mg/kg in rats and 45 mg/kg in rabbits. In these studies, no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats given up to 200 mg/kg or in rabbits given up to 135 mg/kg.</p><p>Although <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> was not formally studied in pregnant patients, 22 pregnancies occurred during the trials. Nineteen of these pregnancies occurred while patients were using <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>. Of the 19 pregnancies, there were 9 healthy infants, 4 spontaneous abortions, 5 induced/elective abortions, and 1 birth defect (Down's Syndrome to a 35-year-old). Because there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, the risk/benefit ratio of using <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> in women with unwanted facial hair who are pregnant should be weighed carefully with serious consideration for either not implementing or discontinuing use of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether or not eflornithine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of this product have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 1373 patients on active treatment in clinical studies of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>, approximately 7% were 65 years or older and approximately 1% were 75 or older. No apparent differences in safety were observed between older patients and younger patients.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse events reported for most body systems occurred at similar frequencies in <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> (eflornithine hydrochloride) cream, 13.9% and vehicle control groups. The most frequent adverse events related to treatment with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> were skin-related. The following table notes the percentage of adverse events associated with the use of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> or its vehicle that occurred at greater than 1% in both the vehicle-controlled studies and the open-label safety studies up to 1 year of continuous use.</p><p>Treatment-related skin adverse events that occurred in less than 1% of the subjects treated with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> are: bleeding skin, cheilitis, contact dermatitis, swelling of lips, herpes simplex, numbness, and rosacea.</p><p>Adverse events were primarily mild in intensity and generally resolved without medical treatment or discontinuation of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>. Only 2% of subjects discontinued studies due to an adverse event related to use of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>.</p><h3>Laboratory Test Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">No laboratory test abnormalities have been consistently found to be associated with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>. In an open-label study, some patients showed an increase in their transaminases; however, the clinical significance of these findings is not known.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdosage information with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is unavailable. Given the low percutaneous penetration of this drug, overdosage via the topical route is not expected (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>). However, should very high topical doses (e.g., multiple tubes per day) or oral ingestion be encountered (a 30 g tube contains 4.2 g of eflornithine hydrochloride), the patient should be monitored, and appropriate supportive measures administered as necessary.</p><p>(Note: Use of an intravenous formulation of eflornithine hydrochloride at high doses (400 mg/kg/day or approximately 24 g/day) for the treatment of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection (African sleeping sickness) has been associated with adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. Adverse events in this setting have included hair loss, facial swelling, seizures, hearing impairment, stomach upset, loss of appetite, headache, weakness and dizziness. A variety of hematological toxicities, including anemia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia have also been observed, but these were usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment.)</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Apply a thin layer of <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> (eflornithine hydrochloride) cream, 13.9% to affected areas of the face and adjacent involved areas under the chin and rub in thoroughly. Do not wash treated area for at least 4 hours. Use twice daily at least 8 hours apart or as directed by a physician. The patient should continue to use hair removal techniques as needed in conjunction with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>. (<span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> should be applied at least 5 minutes after hair removal.)

VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> (pronounced "VAN-i-ka") is a prescription medication applied to the skin for the reduction of unwanted facial hair in women.</p><p>The active ingredient in <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is eflornithine hydrochloride. <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> also contains ceteareth-20, cetearyl alcohol, dimethicone, glyceryl stearate, methylparaben, mineral oil, PEG-100 stearate,  phenoxyethanol, propylparaben, stearyl  alcohol and water. </p><p><span class="Bold">How does VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> <span class="Bold">work?</span> <span class="Bold"><br/>
VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> interferes with an enzyme found in the hair follicle of the skin needed for hair growth. This results in slower hair growth and improved appearance where <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> is applied.</p><p><span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> does not permanently remove hair or "cure" unwanted facial hair. It is not a depilatory. Your treatment program should include continuation of any hair removal technique you are currently using.</p><p><span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> will help you manage your condition and improve your appearance.</p><p>Improvement in the condition occurs gradually. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Be patient. Improvement may be seen as early as 4 to 8 weeks of treatment. Improvement may take longer in some individuals. If no improvement is seen after 6 months of use, discontinue use. Clinical studies show that in about 8 weeks after stopping treatment with <span class="Bold">VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>, the hair will return to the same condition as before beginning treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Who should not use VANIQA</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span><span class="Bold">?</span> <br/>
