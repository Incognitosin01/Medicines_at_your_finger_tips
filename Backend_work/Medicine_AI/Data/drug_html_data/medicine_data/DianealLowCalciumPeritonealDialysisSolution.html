</ul><h2>Dianeal Low Calcium Peritoneal Dialysis Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Dianeal<span class="Sup">®</span> Low Calcium peritoneal dialysis solutions are sterile, nonpyrogenic solutions in UltraBag™ containers for intraperitoneal administration only. They contain no bacteriostatic or antimicrobial agents. UltraBag™ containers are designed with an integrated “Y” set and drain container for infusion and drainage of Dianeal<span class="Sup">®</span> Low Calcium when disconnection of the “Y” set from the transfer set during dwell is desired.</p><p>Composition, calculated osmolarity, pH and ionic concentrations are shown in the following table.</p><p>The plastic container tubing set is fabricated from polyvinyl chloride (PL 146<span class="Sup">®</span> Plastic). Exposure to temperatures above 25°C/77°F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period. The amount of water that can permeate from inside the solution container into the overpouch is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials.</p><h2>Dianeal Low Calcium Peritoneal Dialysis Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Peritoneal dialysis is a procedure for removing toxic substances and metabolites normally excreted by the kidneys, and for aiding in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance.</p><p>The procedure is accomplished by instilling peritoneal dialysis fluid through a conduit into the peritoneal cavity. Toxic substances and metabolites, present in high concentration in the blood, cross the peritoneal membrane into the dialyzing fluid. Dextrose in the dialyzing fluid is used to produce a solution hyperosmolar to the plasma, creating an osmotic gradient which facilitates fluid removal from the patient’s plasma into the peritoneal cavity. After a period of time, (dwell time), the fluid is drained by gravity from the cavity.</p><p>The solution does not contain potassium. In situations in which there is a normal serum potassium level or hypokalemia, the addition of potassium chloride (up to a concentration of 4 mEq/L) may be indicated to prevent severe hypokalemia. <span class="Bold">Addition of potassium chloride should be made after careful evaluation of serum and total body potassium and only under the direction of a physician.</span></p><p>Clinical studies have demonstrated the use of this solution resulted in significant increases in serum CO2 and decreases in serum magnesium levels. The decrease in magnesium levels did not cause clinically significant hypomagnesemia.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Dianeal Low Calcium Peritoneal Dialysis Solution</h2><p class="First">Dianeal<span class="Sup">®</span> Low Calcium peritoneal dialysis solutions in UltraBag™ containers are indicated for use in chronic renal failure patients being maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis when nondialytic medical therapy is judged to be inadequate.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None known.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Not for Intravenous Injection</span>.</p><p>Use aseptic technique. Contamination of Luer lock connector may result in peritonitis.</p><p>An improper clamping sequence may result in infusion of air into the peritoneum.</p><p>Peritoneal dialysis should be done with great care, if at all, in patients with a number of conditions, including disruption of the peritoneal membrane or diaphragm by surgery or trauma, extensive adhesions, bowel distention, undiagnosed abdominal disease, abdominal wall infection, hernias or burns, fecal fistula or colostomy, tense ascites, obesity, large polycystic kidneys, recent aortic graft replacement, lactic acidosis, and severe pulmonary disease. When assessing peritoneal dialysis as the mode of therapy in such extreme situations, the benefits to the patient must be weighed against the possible complications.</p><p>An accurate fluid balance record must be kept and the weight of the patient carefully monitored to avoid over or under hydration with severe consequences, including congestive heart failure, volume depletion, and shock.</p><p>Excessive use of Dianeal<span class="Sup">®</span> Low Calcium peritoneal dialysis solution with 4.25% dextrose during a peritoneal dialysis treatment can result in significant removal of water from the patient.</p><p>Stable patients undergoing maintenance peritoneal dialysis should have routine periodic evaluation of blood chemistries and hematologic factors, as well as other indicators of patient status.</p><p>If the resealable rubber plug on the medication port is missing or partially removed, do not use product.</p><p>After removing overpouch, check for minute leaks by squeezing container firmly. If leaks are found, discard the solution because the sterility may be impaired.</p><p>After the pull ring has been removed from the outlet, check for broken connector frangible seal as evidenced by continuous fluid flow from port. A few drops of solution within the connector or protector cap may be present. If a continuous stream or droplets of fluid are noted, discard solution because sterility may be impaired.</p><p>During solution drainage, fibrin strands may be observed in the solution and may become attached to the connector frangible closure. In occasional instances, partial or complete obstruction of draining may occur. Manipulation of the connector frangible closure in the tubing may free the fibrin obstruction.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General:</h3><p class="First">Do not administer unless solution is clear.</p><p>Aseptic technique must be used throughout the procedure and at its termination in order to reduce the possibility of infection.</p><p>Significant losses of protein, amino acids and water soluble vitamins may occur during peritoneal dialysis. Replacement therapy should be provided as necessary.</p><p>When prescribing the solution to be used for an individual patient, consideration should be given to the potential interaction between the dialysis treatment and therapy directed at other existing illnesses. For example, rapid potassium removal may create arrhythmias in cardiac patients using digitalis or similar drugs; digitalis toxicity may be masked by elevated potassium or magnesium, or by hypocalcemia. Correction of electrolytes by dialysis may precipitate signs and symptoms of digitalis excess. Conversely, toxicity may occur at suboptimal dosages of digitalis if potassium is low or calcium high. Azotemic diabetics require careful monitoring of insulin requirements during and following dialysis with dextrose containing solutions.</p><h3>Laboratory tests:</h3><p class="First">Serum electrolytes, magnesium, bicarbonate levels and fluid balance should be periodically monitored.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility:</h3><p class="First">Studies to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of this product, or its potential to affect fertility adversely, have not been performed.</p><h3>Pregnancy:</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dianeal<span class="Sup">®</span> Low Calcium peritoneal dialysis solution. It is also not known whether Dianeal<span class="Sup">®</span> Low Calcium peritoneal dialysis solution can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Dianeal<span class="Sup">®</span> Low Calcium peritoneal dialysis solution should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing mothers:</h3><p class="First">Caution should be exercised when Dianeal<span class="Sup">®</span> Low Calcium peritoneal dialysis solution is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric use:</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions to peritoneal dialysis include mechanical and solution related problems as well as the results of contamination of equipment or improper technique in catheter placement. Abdominal pain, bleeding, peritonitis, subcutaneous infection around the peritoneal catheter, catheter site infection, catheter blockage, difficulty in fluid removal, and ileus are among the complications of the procedure. Solution related adverse reactions may include peritonitis, electrolyte and fluid imbalances, hypovolemia, hypervolemia, hypotension, hypertension, disequilibrium syndrome, allergic symptoms, and muscle cramping.</p><h2>Dianeal Low Calcium Peritoneal Dialysis Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Dianeal<span class="Sup">®</span> Low Calcium solutions are intended for intraperitoneal administration only.</p><p>It is recommended that adult patients being placed on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis should be appropriately trained in a program which is under supervision of a physician. Training materials are available from Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, 60015 USA to facilitate this training.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.</p><p>The frequency of treatment, formulation, exchange volume, duration of dwell, and length of dialysis should be selected by the physician responsible for and supervising the treatment of the individual patient.</p><p>To avoid the risk of severe dehydration and hypovolemia and to minimize the loss of protein, it is advisable to select the peritoneal dialysis solution with the lowest level of osmolarity consistent with the fluid removal requirements for that exchange.</p><p>Heating the dialysis solution to 37°C (98.6°F) may decrease discomfort.</p><p>Additives may be incompatible. Do not store solution containing additives.</p><p>Approximately two liters of dialysis solution are instilled into the peritoneal cavity of adults and the peritoneal access device is then clamped. The solution remains in the cavity for dwell times of 4 to 8 hours during the day and 8 to 12 hours overnight. At the conclusion of each dwell period, the access device is opened, the solution drained and fresh solution instilled. The procedure is repeated 3 to 5 times per day, 6 to 7 days per week. Solution exchange frequency should be individualized for adequate biochemical and fluid volume control. The majority of exchanges will utilize 1.5% or 2.5% dextrose containing peritoneal dialysis solutions, with 4.25% dextrose containing solutions being used when extra fluid removal is required. Patient weight is used as the indicator of the need for fluid removal.</p><h2>DIRECTIONS FOR USE</h2><p class="First">Use aseptic technique.</p><p>For complete system preparation, see directions accompanying ancillary equipment.</p><h3>Preparation for Administration</h3><p class="First">1.
