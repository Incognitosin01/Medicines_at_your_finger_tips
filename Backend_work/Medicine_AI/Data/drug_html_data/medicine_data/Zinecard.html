Extravasation happens when an injected medicine escapes from the blood vessels and circulates into tissues in the body. Serious tissue damage can occur when extravasation happens during injection of certain cancer medications.</p><p>Zinecard is also used to help prevent chemotherapy-related heart problems in women who are receiving doxorubicin for metastatic breast cancer.  Zinecard is given only after you have received enough doxorubicin infusions to amount to a certain total dose.</p><p>Zinecard may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Zinecard can harm an unborn baby or cause birth defects if the mother or father is using this medicine. Tell your caregivers if you are pregnant, or if you are a man and your sex partner is able to get pregnant.</p><p>You should not receive <b>Zinecard</b> if your chemotherapy does not include doxorubicin or a similar medication (such as daunorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, or mitoxantrone).</p><p>Tell your doctor at once if you have signs of infection such as fever, chills, sore throat, easy bruising or bleeding, skin sores, or warmth and redness of any surgical incision.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive <b>Zinecard</b> if your chemotherapy does not include doxorubicin or a similar medication such as:</p><ul>

A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>Totect is usually started within 6 hours after extravasation, and continued once daily for 3 days.</p><p>Zinecard is usually started 15 minutes before you receive your doxorubicin infusion. This medicine is not given with your first dose of doxorubicin, but only after you've received prior doxorubicin doses up to a certain total amount.</p><p>Zinecard can add to bone marrow suppression caused by chemotherapy. You may get infections more easily, even serious or fatal infections. Your doctor will need to examine you on a regular basis.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since  Zinecard is given by a healthcare professional as part of your chemotherapy treatment, you are not likely to miss a dose.</p><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss your chemotherapy appointment.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving  Zinecard?</h2><p>Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections.
