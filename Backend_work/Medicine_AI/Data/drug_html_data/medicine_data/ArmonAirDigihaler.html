</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for ArmonAir Digihaler</h2><p class="First">ArmonAir<span class="Sup">®</span> Digihaler<span class="Sup">TM</span> is indicated for the maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy in patients 12 years of age and older.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span>:</p><p>ArmonAir Digihaler is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.</p><h2>ArmonAir Digihaler Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Administer ArmonAir Digihaler as 1 inhalation twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart at the same time every day) by the orally inhaled route. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing after each dose.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>ArmonAir Digihaler does not require priming.</li>
<li>Do not use ArmonAir Digihaler with a spacer or volume holding chamber.</li>
<li>Do not use ArmonAir Digihaler by other routes.</li>
<li>Do not use more than 2 times every 24 hours. The safety and efficacy of ArmonAir Digihaler when administered in excess of recommended dosages have not been established.</li>
</ul><p>If symptoms arise between doses, an inhaled short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist should be used for immediate relief.</p><h3>Recommended Dosage</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dosage for ArmonAir Digihaler is based on asthma severity and current asthma drug therapy and strength. For example:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>
<p class="First">For patients with greater asthma severity, use the higher doses: either</p>
<ul class="Circle">
<li>
<p class="First">113 mcg (113 mcg of fluticasone propionate) administered twice daily; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">232 mcg (232 mcg of fluticasone propionate) administered twice daily.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">For patients not taking inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), with less severe asthma, select 55 mcg (55 mcg of fluticasone propionate), administered twice daily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">For patients switching to ArmonAir Digihaler from another ICS: select the low (55 mcg), medium (113 mcg), or high (232 mcg) dose strength of ArmonAir Digihaler based on the strength of the previous ICS product and disease severity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p class="First">For patients with greater asthma severity, use the higher doses: either</p><ul class="Circle">
<li>
<p class="First">113 mcg (113 mcg of fluticasone propionate) administered twice daily; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">232 mcg (232 mcg of fluticasone propionate) administered twice daily.</p>
</li>
</ul><p class="First">113 mcg (113 mcg of fluticasone propionate) administered twice daily; or</p><p class="First">232 mcg (232 mcg of fluticasone propionate) administered twice daily.</p><p class="First">For patients not taking inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), with less severe asthma, select 55 mcg (55 mcg of fluticasone propionate), administered twice daily.</p><p class="First">For patients switching to ArmonAir Digihaler from another ICS: select the low (55 mcg), medium (113 mcg), or high (232 mcg) dose strength of ArmonAir Digihaler based on the strength of the previous ICS product and disease severity.</p><p>The maximum benefit may not be achieved for up to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose of ArmonAir Digihaler after 2 weeks of therapy, increasing the dose may provide additional asthma control. The highest recommended dose is 232 mcg twice daily.</p><p>If a previously effective dosage regimen of ArmonAir Digihaler fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g., replacing the current strength of ArmonAir Digihaler with a higher strength, or adding additional controller therapies) should be considered. After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects.</p><h3>Storing and Cleaning the Inhaler</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Keep the inhaler in a cool dry place.</li>
<li>Routine maintenance is not required. If the mouthpiece needs cleaning, gently wipe the mouthpiece with a dry cloth or tissue as needed.</li>
<li>Never wash or put any part of the inhaler in water.</li>
</ul><h3>Dose Counter and Storage of Inhaler Events Data</h3><p class="First">The ArmonAir Digihaler inhaler has a dose counter.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>The number 60 is displayed (prior to use).</li>
<li>The dose counter will count down each time the mouthpiece is opened and closed <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</li>
</ul><p>ArmonAir Digihaler contains a built-in electronic module which detects, records, and stores data on inhaler events, including peak inspiratory flow rate (L/min), for transmission to the mobile App where inhaler events are categorized. Use of the App is not required for administration of fluticasone propionate to the patient.  There is no evidence the use of the App leads to improved clinical outcomes, including safety and effectiveness <span class="Italics">[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2)].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Inhalation Powder: ArmonAir Digihaler is an inhalation-driven, multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI) with an electronic module, for oral inhalation that meters 55 mcg, 113 mcg, or 232 mcg of fluticasone propionate from the device reservoir and delivers 51 mcg, 103 mcg, or 210 mcg of fluticasone propionate, respectively, from the mouthpiece per actuation. The ArmonAir Digihaler is a white inhaler with a green cap in a sealed foil pouch with desiccant. ArmonAir Digihaler contains a built-in electronic module <span class="Italics">[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]</span>.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Status Asthmaticus</h3><p class="First">ArmonAir Digihaler is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">ArmonAir Digihaler is contraindicated in patients with known severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins or who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Description (11)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Local Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with <span class="Italics">Candida albicans</span> has occurred in subjects treated with fluticasone propionate MDPI. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with ArmonAir Digihaler continues, but at times therapy with ArmonAir Digihaler may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing following inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.</p><h3>Acute Asthma Episodes</h3><p class="First">ArmonAir Digihaler is not indicated for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. An inhaled, short-acting beta­<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist, not ArmonAir Digihaler, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath. When prescribing ArmonAir Digihaler, the physician must provide the patient with an inhaled, short-acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist (e.g., albuterol) for treatment of acute symptoms, despite regular twice-daily use of ArmonAir Digihaler. Instruct patients to contact their physicians immediately if episodes of asthma not responsive to bronchodilators occur during the course of treatment with ArmonAir Digihaler. During such episodes, patients may require therapy with oral corticosteroids.</p><h3>Immunosuppression</h3><p class="First">Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals.</p><p>Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such patients who have not had these diseases or who have not been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</p><p>Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.</p><h3>Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy</h3><p class="First">Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal (HPA) function.</p><p>Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although ArmonAir Digihaler may improve control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.</p><p>During periods of stress or a severe asthmatic attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physician for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a medical identification warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack.</p><p>Patients requiring systemic corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to ArmonAir Digihaler. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with ArmonAir Digihaler. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>] or morning peak expiratory flow [AM PEF]), beta‑agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids. In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.</p><p>Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to ArmonAir Digihaler may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions).</p><p>During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.</p><h3>Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression</h3><p class="First">ArmonAir Digihaler will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since ArmonAir Digihaler is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of ArmonAir Digihaler in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. A relationship between plasma levels of fluticasone propionate and inhibitory effects on stimulated cortisol production has been shown after 4 weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing ArmonAir Digihaler.</p><p>Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with ArmonAir Digihaler should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.</p><p>It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, the dosage of ArmonAir Digihaler should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids, and for management of asthma symptoms.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis</h3><p class="First">Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), including anaphylaxis, may occur after administration of ArmonAir Digihaler. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of other powder products containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use ArmonAir Digihaler <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.2)].</span></p><h3>Reduction in Bone Mineral Density</h3><p class="First">Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long‑term consequences, such as fracture, is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care.</p><h3>Effect on Growth</h3><p class="First">Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ArmonAir Digihaler, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving ArmonAir Digihaler routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ArmonAir Digihaler, titrate each patient’s dosage to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><h3>Glaucoma and Cataracts</h3><p class="First">Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients following the long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.</p><h3>Paradoxical Bronchospasm</h3><p class="First">As with other inhaled medicines, bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. If bronchospasm occurs following dosing with ArmonAir Digihaler, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; ArmonAir Digihaler should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted.</p><h3>Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">The use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with ArmonAir Digihaler is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid adverse effects may occur <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome</h3><p class="First">In rare cases, patients on inhaled fluticasone propionate may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg‑Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of fluticasone propionate. Cases of serious eosinophilic conditions have also been reported with other inhaled corticosteroids in this clinical setting. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between fluticasone propionate and these underlying conditions has not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Systemic and local corticosteroid use may result in the following:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Italics">Candida albicans</span> infection <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<span class="Italics">5</span>.1)]</span></li>
<li>Immunosuppression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety of ArmonAir Digihaler has been established from adequate and well-controlled studies of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder [ARMONAIR RESPICLICK, hereafter referred to as fluticasone propionate multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI)].</p><p>In two placebo-controlled, 12-week, clinical studies (Trial 1 and Trial 2) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span> a total of 822 adolescent and adult patients with persistent symptomatic asthma despite ICS or ICS/LABA therapy were treated twice daily with either placebo; or fluticasone propionate MDPI 55 mcg, 113 mcg, or 232 mcg. Sixty percent of patients were female and 80% of patients were white. The average duration of exposure was 82 days in the fluticasone propionate MDPI groups compared with 75 days in the placebo group.

The types of adverse reactions among fluticasone propionate MDPI treatments were similar to those reported above in placebo-controlled studies.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post‑approval use of fluticasone propionate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to fluticasone propionate or a combination of these factors.</p><p><span class="Bold">Ear, Nose, and Throat</span>: Aphonia, facial and oropharyngeal edema, and throat soreness.</p><p><span class="Bold">Endocrine and Metabolic</span>: Cushingoid features, growth velocity reduction in children/adolescents, hyperglycemia, and osteoporosis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Eye</span>: Cataracts, blurred vision, and central serous chorioretinopathy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immune System Disorders</span>: Immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, rash, angioedema, and bronchospasm, have been reported.

The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with ArmonAir Digihaler is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid adverse effects may occur.</p><p><span class="Bold">Ritonavir</span>: A drug interaction trial with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray in healthy subjects has shown that ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression.</p><p><span class="Bold">Ketoconazole</span>: Coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in a 1.9‑fold increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure and a 45% decrease in plasma cortisol area under the curve (AUC), but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no randomized clinical studies of ArmonAir Digihaler in pregnant women. There are clinical considerations with the use of ArmonAir Digihaler in pregnant women <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Considerations]</span>. In animals, teratogenicity characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight, and/or skeletal variations in rats, mice, and rabbits were observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the maximum recommended human daily inhaled dose (MRHDID) on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. However, fluticasone propionate administered via inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose approximately 2 times the MRHDID on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. Experience with oral corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. The estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease‑Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</span></p><p>In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma, there is an increased risk of several perinatal adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age for the neonate.

Omphalocele, decreased body weight, and skeletal variations were observed in rat fetuses, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 2 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 100 mcg/kg/day). The rat no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was observed at approximately 0.6 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mcg/kg/day). Cleft palate and fetal skeletal variations were observed in mouse fetuses at a dose approximately 0.5 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 45 mcg/kg/day). The mouse NOAEL was observed with a dose approximately 0.16 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 15 mcg/kg/day).</p><p>In an embryo/fetal development study with pregnant rats dosed by the inhalation route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced decreased fetal body weights and skeletal variations, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 0.5 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal inhalation dose of 25.7 mcg/kg/day); however, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. The NOAEL was observed with a dose approximately 0.1 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal inhalation dose of 5.5 mcg/kg/day).</p><p>In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits that were dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced reductions of fetal body weights, in the presence of maternal toxicity at doses approximately 0.02 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.57 mcg/kg/day). Teratogenicity was evident based upon a finding of cleft palate for 1 fetus at a dose approximately 0.2 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcg/kg/day).

Use of ArmonAir Digihaler for this indication was supported by evidence from two adequate and well-controlled trials in pediatric patients 12 years old and older with persistent symptomatic asthma despite ICS or ICS/LABA therapy (Trials 1 and 2) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In these trials, 50 adolescents received fluticasone propionate MDPI one inhalation twice daily.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of ArmonAir Digihaler in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.</p><p>Inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span>. A reduction of growth velocity in children or teenagers may occur as a result of poorly controlled asthma or from use of corticosteroids, including inhaled corticosteroids. The effects of long-term treatment of children and adolescents with inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate, on final adult height are not known.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed in data collected in 135 subjects aged 65 years and older versus younger subjects who were treated with ArmonAir Digihaler in placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 studies.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Formal pharmacokinetic studies using ArmonAir Digihaler have not been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Since fluticasone propionate is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic impairment should be closely monitored.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Formal pharmacokinetic studies using ArmonAir Digihaler have not been conducted in patients with renal impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Chronic overdosage may result in signs/symptoms of hypercorticism <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].</span> Inhalation by healthy volunteers of a single dose of 4,000 mcg of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder or single doses of 1,760 or 3,520 mcg of fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol was well tolerated. Fluticasone propionate given by inhalation aerosol at dosages of 1,320 mcg twice daily for 7 to 15 days to healthy human volunteers was also well tolerated. Repeat oral doses up to 80 mg daily for 10 days in healthy volunteers and repeat oral doses up to 20 mg daily for 42 days in subjects were well tolerated. Adverse reactions were of mild or moderate severity, and incidences were similar in active and placebo treatment groups.</p><h2>ArmonAir Digihaler Description</h2><p class="First">The active component of ArmonAir Digihaler 55 mcg, ArmonAir Digihaler 113 mcg, and ArmonAir Digihaler 232 mcg is fluticasone propionate, a corticosteroid having the chemical name S-(fluoromethyl) 6α,9-difluoro-11ß,17-dihydroxy-16α-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene-17ß-carbothioate, 17-propionate, and the following chemical structure:</p><p>Fluticasone propionate is a white powder with a molecular weight of 500.6, and the empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">25</span>H<span class="Sub">31</span>F<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">5</span>S. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide, and slightly soluble in methanol and 95% ethanol.</p><p>ArmonAir Digihaler is a multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI) with an electronic module, for oral inhalation only. It contains a formulation blend of fluticasone propionate and alpha lactose monohydrate (which may contain milk proteins). The opening of the mouthpiece cover meters 11.5 mg of the formulation from the device reservoir, which contains 55 mcg, 113 mcg, or 232 mcg of fluticasone propionate. Patient inhalation through the mouthpiece causes the deagglomeration and aerosolization of the drug particles as the formulation moves through the cyclone component of the device. This is followed by dispersion into the airstream.</p><p>Under standardized in vitro test conditions, the ArmonAir Digihaler inhaler delivers 51 mcg, 103 mcg, or 210 mcg of fluticasone propionate with lactose from the mouthpiece when tested at a flow rate of 88 L/min for 1.4 seconds.</p><p>The amount of drug delivered to the lung will depend on patient factors such as inspiratory flow profiles. In adult subjects (N=50, aged 18 to 45 years) with asthma, mean peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the MDPI inhaler was 108.28 L/min (range: 70.37 to 129.24 L/min). In adolescent subjects (N=50, aged 12 to 17 years) with asthma, mean peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the MDPI inhaler was 106.72 L/min (range: 73.64 to 125.51 L/min).</p><p>ArmonAir Digihaler includes a QR code (on the top of the inhaler), and contains a built-in electronic module which automatically detects, records and stores data on inhaler events, including peak inspiratory flow rate (L/min). ArmonAir Digihaler may pair with and transmit data to the mobile App where inhaler events are categorized.</p><h2>ArmonAir Digihaler - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in humans are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.</p><p>Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in the treatment of asthma.</p><p>Though effective for the treatment of asthma, corticosteroids do not affect asthma symptoms immediately. Individual patients will experience a variable time of onset and degree of symptom relief. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. When corticosteroids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer.</p><p>Trials in subjects with asthma have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects with recommended doses of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, negligible oral systemic availability (&lt;1%), and the minimal pharmacological activity of the only metabolite detected in man.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal Axis Effects (HPA)</span></p><p>The potential systemic effects of ArmonAir Digihaler on the HPA axis were not fully studied, but other clinical trials evaluated the systemic effects of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder on the HPA axis in healthy subjects and in subjects with asthma.</p><p>There are no data regarding serum cortisol from controlled trials using ArmonAir Digihaler in healthy subjects or subjects with asthma.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Fluticasone propionate acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate was negligible (&lt;1%), primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver. In contrast, the majority of the fluticasone propionate delivered to the lung was systemically absorbed.</p><p>Following fluticasone propionate MDPI administration, the peak plasma concentration of fluticasone propionate occurs at approximately 1 hour after inhalation.</p><p>The mean peak concentration following a 232 mcg single oral inhalation of fluticasone propionate MDPI to patients 12 years and older with persistent asthma was 73 pg/mL.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg.</p><p>The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averages 99%. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and is not significantly bound to human transcortin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Terminal half-life estimate of fluticasone propionate following oral inhalation administration of fluticasone propionate MDPI was approximately 11.2 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>The total clearance of fluticasone propionate is high (average, 1,093 mL/min), with renal clearance accounting for less than 0.02% of the total. The only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17β carboxylic acid derivative of fluticasone propionate, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This metabolite has less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose of fluticasone propionate was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Age</span>: No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed with  ArmonAir Digihaler in children or geriatric patients. A subgroup analysis was conducted to compare patients aged 12-17 (n=16) and ≥18 (n=23) years following administration of 232 mcg fluticasone propionate MDPI. No overall differences in fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics were observed.</p><p><span class="Italics">Sex</span>: A subgroup analysis was conducted to compare male (n=22) and female (n=17) patients following administration of 232 mcg fluticasone propionate MDPI.

Patients should never try to alter the numbers for the dose counter. Discard the inhaler when the counter displays 0, 30 days after opening the foil pouch or after the expiration date on the product, whichever comes first. The labeled amount of medication in each actuation cannot be assured after the counter displays 0, even though the inhaler is not completely empty and will continue to operate <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></p><h3>Storage and Handling</h3><p class="First">Store at room temperature (between 15ºF and 25ºC; 59ºF and 77ºF) in a dry place; excursions permitted from 59ºF to 86ºF (15ºC to 30ºC). Avoid exposure to extreme heat, cold, or humidity.</p><p>Keep out of reach of children.</p><p>ArmonAir Digihaler should be stored inside the unopened, moisture‑protective foil pouch and removed from the pouch immediately before initial use. Discard ArmonAir Digihaler 30 days after opening the foil pouch or when the counter reads “0”, whichever comes first. The inhaler is not reusable. Do not attempt to take the inhaler apart.</p><p>ArmonAir Digihaler includes a QR code, and contains a built-in electronic module which automatically detects, records, and stores data on inhaler events, including peak inspiratory flow rate (L/min). ArmonAir Digihaler may pair with and transmit data to the mobile App via Bluetooth<span class="Sup">®</span> wireless technology where inhaler events are categorized.</p><p>ArmonAir Digihaler contains a lithium-manganese dioxide battery and should be disposed of in accordance with state and local regulations.</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use).</p><p>Patients should be given the following information:</p><p><span class="Bold">Local Effects</span></p><p>Inform patients that localized infections with <span class="Italics">Candida albicans</span> occurred in the mouth and pharynx in some patients. If oropharyngeal candidiasis develops, treat it with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while still continuing therapy with ArmonAir Digihaler, but at times therapy with ArmonAir Digihaler may need to be temporarily interrupted under close medical supervision. Rinsing the mouth with water without swallowing after inhalation is advised to help reduce the risk of thrush.</p><p><span class="Bold">Status Asthmaticus and Acute Asthma Symptoms</span></p><p>Inform patients that ArmonAir Digihaler is not a bronchodilator and is not intended for use as rescue medicine for acute asthma exacerbations. Advise patients to treat acute asthma symptoms with an inhaled, short‑acting beta<span class="Sub">2</span>‑agonist such as albuterol. Instruct the patient to contact their physicians immediately if there is deterioration of their asthma.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immunosuppression</span></p><p>Warn patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed, to consult their physicians without delay. Inform patients of potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression</span></p><p>Advise patients that ArmonAir Digihaler may cause systemic corticosteroid effects of hypercorticism and adrenal suppression. Additionally, instruct patients that deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids. Patients should taper slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to ArmonAir Digihaler.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions</span></p><p>Advise patients that immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, and hypotension), including anaphylaxis, may occur after administration of ArmonAir Digihaler. Patients should discontinue ArmonAir Digihaler if such reactions occur and contact their healthcare provider or get emergency medical help. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of powder products containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not take ArmonAir Digihaler.</p><p><span class="Bold">Reduction in Bone Mineral Density (BMD)</span></p><p>Advise patients who are at an increased risk for decreased BMD that the use of corticosteroids may pose an additional risk.</p><p><span class="Bold">Reduced Growth Velocity</span></p><p>Inform patients that orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ArmonAir Digihaler, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Physicians should closely follow the growth of adolescents taking corticosteroids by any route.</p><p><span class="Bold">Ocular Effects</span></p><p>Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids may increase the risk of some eye problems (cataracts or glaucoma); consider regular eye examinations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span></p><p>Inform patients who are pregnant or nursing that they should contact their physician about the use of ArmonAir Digihaler.</p><p><span class="Bold">Use Daily for Best Effect</span></p><p>Patients should use ArmonAir Digihaler at regular intervals as directed. The daily dosage of ArmonAir Digihaler should not exceed 1 inhalation twice a day. Advise patients, if they miss a dose, to take their next dose at the same time they normally do and to not take 2 doses at one time. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief and the full benefit may not be achieved until treatment has been administered for 1 to 2 weeks or longer. Patients should not increase the prescribed dosage but should contact their physicians if symptoms do not improve or if the condition worsens. Instruct patients to not stop use of ArmonAir Digihaler abruptly. Patients should contact their physicians immediately if they discontinue use of ArmonAir Digihaler.</p><p><span class="Bold">Use of ArmonAir Digihaler and Mobile App</span></p><p>Direct the patient to the Instructions for Use (IFU) for information on how to set up the App and use the inhaler. Advise the patient that pairing of the inhaler to the App, having Bluetooth turned on, or being near their smartphone is not required for delivery of the medication from the inhaler or for normal use of the product.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dose Counter</span></p><p>Instruct patients that the ArmonAir Digihaler inhaler has a dose counter that displays the number of actuations (inhalations) left in the inhaler. When the patient receives a new inhaler, the number 60 will be displayed. The dose counter will count down each time the mouthpiece is opened and closed. The dose counter window displays the number of actuations (inhalations) left in the inhaler in units of two (e.g., 60, 58, 56, etc.). When the dose counter reaches 20, the color of the numbers will change to red to remind the patient to contact their pharmacist or healthcare provider for a refill of their medication. When the dose counter reaches 0, the patient should stop using the inhaler, and it should be disposed of in accordance with state and local regulations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Caring for and Storing the Inhaler</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Instruct patients to not open their inhaler unless they are taking a dose.</span> Repeated opening and closing the cover without taking medication will waste medication and may damage the inhaler.</p><p>Advise patients to keep their inhaler dry and clean at all times. <span class="Bold">Never wash or put any part of the inhaler in water.</span> Patients should replace inhaler if washed or placed in water.</p><p><span class="Bold">Advise patients to immediately replace inhaler if mouthpiece cover is damaged or broken.</span></p><p>Gently wipe the mouthpiece with a dry cloth or tissue as needed.</p><p>Instruct patients to store the inhaler at room temperature and to avoid exposure to extreme heat, cold, or humidity.</p><p><span class="Bold">Instruct patients to never take the inhaler apart.</span></p><p>Instruct patients to discard ArmonAir Digihaler when the dose counter displays 0, 30 days after opening the foil pouch or after the expiration date on the product, whichever comes first.</p><p><span class="Bold">Rx only</span></p><p>Distributed by:</p><p>Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.<br/>
