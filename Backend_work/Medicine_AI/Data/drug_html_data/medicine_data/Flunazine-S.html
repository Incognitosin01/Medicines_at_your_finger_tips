The injection should be given only in the neck musculature with a maximum of 10 mL per site.</p><p>Note:  Intramuscular injection may cause local tissue irritation and damage.  In an injection-site irritation study, the tissue damage did not resolve in all animals by Day 28 post-injection.  This may result in trim loss of edible tissue at slaughter.<br/></p><p class="First">There are no known contraindications to this drug in swine when used as directed.  Do not use in animals showing hypersensitivity to flunixin meglumine.  Use judiciously when renal impairment or gastric ulceration is suspected.<br/></p><p class="First">Swine must not be slaughtered for human consumption within 12 days of the last treatment.<br/></p><p class="First">PRECAUTIONS</p><p>As a class, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitory NSAIDs may be associated with gastrointestinal, renal and hepatic toxicity.  Sensitivity to drug-associated adverse events varies with the individual patient.  Patients at greatest risk for those that are dehydrated, on concomitant diuretic therapy, or those with existing renal, cardiovascular, and/or hepatic dysfunction.  Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be carefully approached.  NSAIDs may inhibit the prostoglandins that maintain normal homeostatic function.  Such prostaglandin effects may result in clinically significant disease in patients with underlying or pre-existing disease that has not been previously diagnosed.  Since may NSAIDs possess the potential to produce gastrointestinal ulceration, concomitant use of flunixin meglumine with other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as other NSAIDs and corticosteroids, should be avoided.</p><p>Not for use in breeding swine.  The reproductive effects of Flunazine-S Injection Solution have not been investigated in this class of swine.  Intramuscular injection may cause local tissue irritation and damage.  In an injection-site irritation study, the tissue damage did not resolve in all animals by Day 28 post-injection.  this may result in trim loss of edible tissue at slaughter.<br/></p><p class="First">SAFETY</p><p>Flunixin was mildly irritating at the injection sites.  No other flunixin-related changes (adverse reactions) were noted in swine administered a 1X (2.2 mg/kg; 1.0 mg/lb) dose for 9 days.  Minimal toxicity manifested itself as statistically significant increased spleen weight at elevated doses (5X or higher daily for 9 days) with no changes in normal microscopic architecture.<br/></p><p class="First">Flunazine-S Injectable Solution, 50 mg/mL, is available in 100 mL multi-dose vial.</p><p><br/></p><p class="First">Store between 2degrees and 30degrees C (36degrees and 86degrees F).<br/></p><p class="First">REFERENCES</p><p>1.
