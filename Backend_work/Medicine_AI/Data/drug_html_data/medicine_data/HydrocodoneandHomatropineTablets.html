</ul><h2>Hydrocodone and Homatropine Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Administer Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets by the oral route only.   </p><p>Advise patients not to increase the dose or dosing frequency of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets because serious adverse events such as respiratory depression may occur with overdosage [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Overdosage (10)</span>].  The dosage of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets should not be increased if cough fails to respond; an unresponsive cough should be reevaluated for possible underlying pathology [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>].</p><h3>Recommended Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults 18 years of age and older</span>: One (1) tablet every 4 to 6 hours as needed; not to exceed six (6) tablets in 24 hours.</p><h3>Monitoring, Maintenance, and Discontinuation of Therapy</h3><p class="First">Prescribe Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets for the shortest duration that is consistent with individual patient treatment goals [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>Reevaluate patients with unresponsive cough in 5 days or sooner for possible underlying pathology, such as foreign body or lower respiratory tract disease [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>]. If a patient requires a refill, reevaluate the cause of the cough and assess the need for continued treatment with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets, the relative incidence of adverse reactions, and the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><p>Do not abruptly discontinue Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets in a physically-dependent patient [<span class="Italics">see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)</span>]. When a patient who has been taking Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Tablet: Each tablet contains hydrocodone bitartrate 5 mg; and homatropine bromide 1.5 mg and supplied as white, round, scored biconvex tablet debossed with "N" on upper side of the score, "350" on the lower side of the score and plain on the other side [<span class="Italics">see Description (11)</span>].  </p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets is contraindicated for:</p><ul class="Disc">

Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression).</p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [<span class="Italics">see Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, including hydrocodone, one of the active ingredients in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets. Hydrocodone produces dose-related respiratory depression by directly acting on the brain stem respiratory center that controls respiratory rhythm and may produce irregular and periodic breathing. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression includes discontinuation of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets, close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists (e.g. naloxone), depending on the patient's clinical status [<span class="Italics">see Overdosage (10)</span>]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy, when Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are used concomitantly with other drugs that may cause respiratory depression [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>], in patients with chronic pulmonary disease or decreased respiratory reserve, and in patients with altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance (e.g. elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients) [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>].</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are essential [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span>]. Monitor patients closely, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy or when used in patients at higher risk.</p><p>Overdose of hydrocodone in adults has been associated with fatal respiratory depression, and the use of hydrocodone in children younger than 6 years of age has been associated with fatal respiratory depression when used as recommended. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death.</p><h3>Risks with Use in Pediatric Populations</h3><p class="First">Children are particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of hydrocodone [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death, Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets is contraindicated in children less than 6 years of age [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><p>Use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets in children also exposes them to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [<span class="Italics">see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)</span>]<span class="Italics">,</span> which can lead to overdose and death [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Overdosage (10)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span> Because the benefits of symptomatic treatment of cough associated with allergies or the common cold do not outweigh the risks of use of hydrocodone in pediatric patients, Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets is not indicated for use in patients younger than 18 years of age [<span class="Italics">see Indications (1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</span>].</p><h3>Risks with Use in Other At-Risk Populations</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Unresponsive Cough</span></p><p>The dosage of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets should not be increased if cough fails to respond; an unresponsive cough should be reevaluated in 5 days or sooner for possible underlying pathology, such as foreign body or lower respiratory tract disease [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Asthma and Other Pulmonary Disease</span></p><p>The use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><p>Opioid analgesics and antitussives, including hydrocodone, one of the active ingredients in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets, should not be used in patients with acute febrile illness associated with productive cough or in patients with chronic respiratory disease where interference with ability to clear the tracheobronchial tree of secretions would have a deleterious effect on the patient's respiratory function.</p><p>Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets -treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or <span class="Italics">cor pulmonale</span>, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</span>: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</p><p>Because of the risk of respiratory depression, avoid the use of opioid antitussives, including Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets in patients with compromised respiratory function, patients at risk of respiratory failure, and in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients. If Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are prescribed, monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets and when Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>].</p><h3>Risks of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. To reduce the risk of overdose and respiratory depression, ensure that the dose of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are communicated clearly and dispensed accurately [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.1)</span>].</p><h3>Activities Requiring Mental Alertness: Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone, one of the active ingredients in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets, may produce marked drowsiness and impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Advise patients to avoid engaging in hazardous tasks requiring mental alertness and motor coordination after ingestion of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets.  Avoid concurrent use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants because additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>].</p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of hydrocodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>], particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablet -treated patients may increase hydrocodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions.</p><p>Concomitant use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of an CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease hydrocodone plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to hydrocodone.</p><p>Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets in patients who are taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer. If concomitant use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets with a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer is necessary, monitor patients for signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)</span>].</p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of opioids, including Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets, with benzodiazepines, or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, avoid use of opioid cough medications in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.4)</span>].</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. Because of similar pharmacologic properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with concomitant use of opioid cough medications and benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation if Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are used with benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other CNS depressants [<span class="Italics">see Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages, or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol, while on Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of hydrocodone [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.1)</span>].</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>]. The use of hydrocodone in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.</p><p>The concurrent use of anticholinergics with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets may produce paralytic ileus [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.9)</span>].</p><p>The hydrocodone in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets may result in constipation or obstructive bowel disease, especially in patients with underlying intestinal motility disorders. Use with caution in patients with underlying intestinal motility disorders.</p><p>The hydrocodone in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, resulting in an increase in biliary tract pressure. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)</span>]. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Head Injury, Impaired Consciousness, Increased Intracranial Pressure, or Brain Tumors</h3><p class="First">Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce adverse reactions that may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</h3><p class="First">The hydrocodone in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets therapy.</p><h3>Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are not recommended for use in pregnant women. Prolonged use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>]</p><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are not recommended for use in pregnant women. Prolonged use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.

Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>]</p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible.  If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">Because opioid agonists may increase biliary tract pressure, with resultant increase in plasma amylase or lipase levels, determination of these enzyme levels may be unreliable for 24 hours after administration of a dose of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:</p><ul class="Disc">

Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or nonprescription products containing alcohol while on Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets therapy [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets and CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), or protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), can increase the plasma concentration of hydrocodone, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets and CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are achieved [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</span>]. After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the hydrocodone plasma concentration will decrease [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to hydrocodone.</p><p>Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets while taking a CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor. If concomitant use is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.</p><h3>CYP3A4 Inducers</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets and CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, carbamazepine, or phenytoin, can decrease the plasma concentration of hydrocodone [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to hydrocodone [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</span>]. After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the hydrocodone plasma concentration will increase [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression.</p><p>Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets in patients who are taking CYP3A4 inducers. If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inducer is necessary, follow the patient for reduced efficacy.</p><h3>Benzodiazepines, and Other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First">Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets in patients who are taking benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>], and instruct patients to avoid consumption of alcohol while on Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>].</p><h3>Serotonergic Drugs</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation.  Discontinue Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected.</p><h3>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)</h3><p class="First">Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets in patients who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or have taken MAOIs within 14 days. The use of MAOIs or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone, one of the active ingredients in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets, may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone. MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma)<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Muscle Relaxants</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.  Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets in patients taking muscle relaxants.</p><p>If concomitant use is necessary, monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected.</p><h3>Diuretics</h3><p class="First">Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.</p><h3>Anticholinergic Drugs</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)</span>]. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are not recommended for use in pregnant women, including during or immediately prior to labor.</p><p>Prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Clinical Considerations</span>].</p><p>There are no available data with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth.</p><p>Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics">Labor or Delivery</span></p><p>Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate.  Opioids, including Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioids during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Hydrocodone</span></p><p>A limited number of pregnancies have been reported in published observational studies and postmarketing reports describing hydrocodone use during pregnancy. However, these data cannot definitely establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. Methodological limitations of these observational studies include small sample size and lack of details regarding dose, duration and timing of exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets; however, studies are available with individual active ingredients or related active ingredients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hydrocodone</span></p><p>In an embryofetal development study in pregnant hamsters dosed on gestation day 8 during the period of organogenesis, hydrocodone induced cranioschisis, a malformation, at approximately 45 times the MRHD (on a mg/m2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 102 mg/kg).  Reproductive toxicology studies were also conducted with codeine, an opiate related to hydrocodone. In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rats dosed throughout the period of organogenesis, codeine increased resorptions and decreased fetal weights at a dose approximately 65 times the MRHD of hydrocodone (on a mg/m2 basis with a maternal oral dose of codeine at 120 mg/kg/day); however, these effects occurred in the presence of maternal toxicity. In embryofetal development studies with pregnant rabbits and mice dosed throughout the period of organogenesis, codeine produced no adverse developmental effects at doses approximately 30 and 160 times, respectively, the MRHD of hydrocodone (on a mg/m2 basis with maternal oral doses of codeine at 30 mg/kg/day in rabbits and 600 mg/kg/day in mice).</p><p><span class="Bold">Homatropine</span></p><p>Animal studies with homatropine are not available.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation, respiratory depression, and death in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets.</p><p>There are no data on the presence of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets in human milk, the effects of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets on the breastfed infant, or the effects of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets on milk production; however, data are available with hydrocodone and homatropine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hydrocodone</span></p><p>Hydrocodone is present in breast milk. Published cases report variable concentrations of hydrocodone and hydromorphone (an active metabolite) in breast milk with administration of immediate-release hydrocodone to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period with relative infant doses of hydrocodone ranging between 1.4 and 3.7%.

Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p>Chronic use of opioids, such as hydrocodone, a component of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets, may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are not indicated for use in patients younger than 18 years of age because the benefits of symptomatic treatment of cough associated with allergies or the common cold do not outweigh the risks for use of hydrocodone in these patients [<span class="Italics">see Indications (1), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>].</p><p>Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received hydrocodone [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death, Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are contraindicated in children less than 6 years of age [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies have not been conducted with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets in geriatric populations.</p><p>Use caution when considering the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets in patients 65 years of age or older. Elderly patients may have increased sensitivity to hydrocodone; greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function; or concomitant disease or other drug therapy [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>].</p><p>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, including Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets. Respiratory depression has occurred after large initial doses of opioids were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.8)</span>].</p><p>Hydrocodone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, monitor these patients closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets has not been characterized in patients with renal impairment. Patients with renal impairment may have higher plasma concentrations than those with normal function [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets should be used with caution in patients with severe impairment of renal function, and patients should be monitored closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets has not been characterized in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment may have higher plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].  Therefore, Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets should be used with caution in patients with severe impairment of hepatic function, and patients should be monitored closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets contains hydrocodone, a Schedule II controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hydrocodone</span></p><p>Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets contains hydrocodone, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including morphine and codeine.

Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Health care providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets</span></p><p>Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are for oral use only. Abuse of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.4)</span>].</p><p>Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Psychological dependence, physical dependence, and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of opioids; therefore, Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets should be prescribed and administered for the shortest duration that is consistent with individual patient treatment goals and patients should be reevaluated prior to refills [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><p>Physical dependence, the condition in which continued administration of the drug is required to prevent the appearance of a withdrawal syndrome, assumes clinically significant proportions only after several weeks of continued oral opioid use, although some mild degree of physical dependence may develop after a few days of opioid therapy.</p><p>If Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets are abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome: restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Hydrocodone</span></p><p>Acute overdose with hydrocodone is characterized by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, hypotension, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death.</p><p>Hydrocodone may cause miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings).

Anticholinergic agents can also precipitate acute narrow angle glaucoma.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment of Overdose</span></p><p>Treatment of overdosage is driven by the overall clinical presentation, and consists of discontinuation of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets together with institution of appropriate therapy. Give primary attention to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent and protected airway and the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.  Gastric emptying may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone and nalmefene, are specific antidotes for respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydrocodone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist.  An antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory depression. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydrocodone in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information.</p><p>Hemodialysis is not routinely used to enhance the elimination of hydrocodone from the body.</p><p>Physostigmine may be used parenterally for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of homatropine toxicity.</p><h2>Hydrocodone and Homatropine Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets, USP contains hydrocodone an opioid agonist, and homatropine a muscarinic antagonist.</p><p>Each tablet of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide contains 5 mg of Hydrocodone Bitartrate, USP and 1.5 mg of Homatropine Methylbromide, USP for oral administartion.</p><p>Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide Tablets also contains the following inactive ingredients: anhydrous lactose, dicalcium phosphate anhydrous, sodium starch glycolate, colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hydrocodone Bitartrate:</span></p><p>The chemical name for hydrocodone bitartrate is 4,5α-epoxy-3-methoxy-17-methylmorphinan-6-one-tartrate (1:1) hydrate (2:5).

The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.</p><p>Hydrocodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings).</p><p>Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span></p><p>Hydrocodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span></p><p>Hydrocodone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on the Endocrine System</span></p><p>Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6)</span>]. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6)</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on the Immune System</span></p><p>Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.</p><p><span class="Italics">Concentration–Adverse Reaction Relationships</span></p><p>There is a relationship between increasing hydrocodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression.

As most agents in the 5-ring morphinan group of semi-synthetic opioids bind plasma protein to a similar degree (range 19% [hydromorphone] to 45% [oxycodone]), hydrocodone is expected to fall within this range.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></span></p><p>Metabolism</p><p>Hydrocodone exhibits a complex pattern of metabolism, including N-demethylation, O-demethylation, and 6keto reduction to the corresponding 6-α-and 6-β-hydroxy metabolites. CYP3A4 mediated N-demethylation to norhydrocodone is the primary metabolic pathway of hydrocodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated O-demethylation to hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is formed from the O-demethylation of hydrocodone and may contribute to the total analgesic effect of hydrocodone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.2)</span>]. Published <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies have shown that N-demethylation of hydrocodone to form norhydrocodone can be attributed to CYP3A4 while O-demethylation of hydrocodone to hydromorphone is predominantly catalyzed by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by an unknown low affinity CYP enzyme.</p><p>Excretion</p><p>Hydrocodone and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in the kidneys.
