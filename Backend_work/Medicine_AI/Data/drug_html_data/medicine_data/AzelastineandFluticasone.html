Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>For intranasal administration only. Prime pump (press 6 times until fine spray appears) prior to first use. If ≥14 days have elapsed since last use, then reprime pump with 1 spray or until a fine mist appears. Shake bottle gently before using. Blow nose to clear nostrils. Keep head tilted downward when spraying. Insert applicator tip <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch into nostril, keeping bottle upright, and close off the other nostril. Breathe in through nose. While inhaling, press pump to release spray. After each use, wipe the spray tip with a clean tissue or cloth and replace cap. Clean spray pump unit and dust cap at least 1 time each week in warm water and allow to completely dry before placing back on bottle. Avoid spraying directly into nasal septum, eyes or mouth. Discard after 120 medicated sprays have been used, even if bottle is not completely empty. The 10 mL bottle [Canadian product] should be discarded after 28 medicated sprays have been used.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); do not refrigerate or freeze. Protect from light. Store in upright position with cap on.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>CNS Depressants: Azelastine (Nasal) may enhance the CNS depressant effect of CNS Depressants. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Strong): May increase the serum concentration of Fluticasone (Nasal).<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Desmopressin: Corticosteroids (Nasal) may enhance the hyponatremic effect of Desmopressin. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.

HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis. Withdrawal and discontinuation of a corticosteroid should be done slowly and carefully. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity. Particular care is required when patients are transferred from systemic corticosteroids to inhaled products due to possible adrenal insufficiency or withdrawal from steroids, including an increase in allergic symptoms. Patients receiving ≥20 mg per day of prednisone (or equivalent) may be most susceptible. Concurrent use of ritonavir (and potentially other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4) may increase fluticasone levels and effects on HPA suppression.</p><p>• CNS depression: May cause CNS depression, which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks which require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving).</p><p>• Delayed wound healing: Avoid nasal corticosteroid use in patients with recent nasal septal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma until healing has occurred.</p><p>• Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may increase the incidence of secondary infection, mask acute infection (including fungal infections), prolong or exacerbate viral infections, or limit response to vaccines. Exposure to chickenpox or measles should be avoided.</p><p>• Infections: Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with ocular herpes simplex, latent tuberculosis, and/or TB reactivity, in patients with untreated fungal, viral, or bacterial infections, or systemic viral or parasitic infections.</p><p>• Local nasal effects: Nasal septal perforation, nasal ulceration, epistaxis, and localized <i>Candida albicans</i> infections of the nose and/or pharynx may occur. Monitor patients periodically for adverse nasal effects.</p><p>• Ocular disease: Increased intraocular pressure, open-angle glaucoma, and cataracts have occurred with intranasal corticosteroid use; use with caution in patients with a history of increased intraocular pressure, cataracts, and/or glaucoma. Consider routine eye exams in chronic users or in patients who report visual changes.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Pediatric: Avoid using higher than recommended dosages; suppression of linear growth (ie, reduction of growth velocity), reduced bone mineral density, or hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome) may occur; titrate to lowest effective dose. Reduction in growth velocity may occur when corticosteroids are administered to pediatric patients, even at recommended doses via intranasal route (monitor growth).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Growth (adolescents and children); signs/symptoms of HPA axis suppression/adrenal insufficiency; possible eosinophilic conditions (including eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [formerly known as Churg-Strauss]); glaucoma and/or cataracts especially in patients with a change in vision; infection; adverse nasal effects (eg, nasal septal perforation, nasal ulceration, epistaxis, localized <i>Candida albicans</i> infections)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Refer to individual monographs.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to ease allergy signs.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
