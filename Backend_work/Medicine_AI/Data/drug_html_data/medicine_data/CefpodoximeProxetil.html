</ul><h2>Cefpodoxime Proxetil Description</h2><p class="First">Cefpodoxime Proxetil USP is an orally administered, extended spectrum, semi-synthetic antibiotic of the cephalosporin class. The chemical name is (RS)-1(isopropoxycarbonyloxy) ethyl(+)-(6R,7R)-7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-{(Z)methoxyimino}acetamido]-3-methoxymethyl-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo [4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate. Its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">21</span>H<span class="Sub">27</span>N<span class="Sub">5</span>O<span class="Sub">9</span>S<span class="Sub">2</span> and its structural formula is represented below:</p><p>The molecular weight of Cefpodoxime Proxetil USP is 557.6.</p><p>Cefpodoxime Proxetil USP is a prodrug; its active metabolite is cefpodoxime. All doses of Cefpodoxime Proxetil USP in this insert are expressed in terms of the active cefpodoxime moiety. The drug is supplied as film-coated tablets. Cefpodoxime Proxetil tablets USP 100 mg contain FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) and FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6 as color additives. Cefpodoxime Proxetil tablets USP 200 mg contain color additives including FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6.</p><p>Cefpodoxime Proxetil tablets USP contain Cefpodoxime Proxetil USP equivalent to 100 mg or 200 mg of cefpodoxime activity and the following inactive ingredients: carboxymethylcellulose calcium, croscarmellose sodium, sodium lauryl sulfate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate and opadry orange. The constituents of opadry orange 03H53614 (used in 100 mg strength) are hypromellose, titanium dioxide, propylene glycol, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) and FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6. The constituents of opadry orange 03H53615 (used in 200 mg strength) are hypromellose, titanium dioxide, propylene glycol, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6 and FD&amp;C Red No. 40.</p><h2>Cefpodoxime Proxetil - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Absorption and Excretion:</h3><p class="First">Cefpodoxime Proxetil is a prodrug that is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and de-esterified to its active metabolite, cefpodoxime. Following oral administration of 100 mg of Cefpodoxime Proxetil to fasting subjects, approximately 50% of the administered cefpodoxime dose was absorbed systemically. Over the recommended dosing range (100 to 400 mg), approximately 29 to 33% of the administered cefpodoxime dose was excreted unchanged in the urine in 12 hours. There is minimal metabolism of cefpodoxime <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>.</p><h3>Effects of Food:</h3><p class="First">The extent of absorption (mean AUC) and the mean peak plasma concentration increased when film-coated tablets were administered with food. Following a 200 mg tablet dose taken with food, the AUC was 21 to 33% higher than under fasting conditions, and the peak plasma concentration averaged 3.1 mcg/mL in fed subjects versus 2.6 mcg/mL in fasted subjects. Time to peak concentration was not significantly different between fed and fasted subjects.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics of Cefpodoxime Proxetil Film-coated Tablets:</h3><p class="First">Over the recommended dosing range (100 to 400 mg), the rate and extent of cefpodoxime absorption exhibited dose-dependency; dose-normalized C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC decreased by up to 32% with increasing dose. Over the recommended dosing range, the Tmax was approximately 2 to 3 hours and the T1/2 ranged from 2.09 to 2.84 hours. Mean Cmax was 1.4 mcg/mL for the 100 mg dose, 2.3 mcg/mL for the 200 mg dose, and 3.9 mcg/mL for the 400 mg dose. In patients with normal renal function, neither accumulation nor significant changes in other pharmacokinetic parameters were noted following multiple oral doses of up to 400 mg Q 12 hours.</p><h3>Distribution:</h3><p class="First">Protein binding of cefpodoxime ranges from 22 to 33% in serum and from 21 to 29% in plasma.</p><p class="First">Following multiple-dose administration every 12 hours for 5 days of 200 mg or 400 mg Cefpodoxime Proxetil, the mean maximum cefpodoxime concentration in skin blister fluid averaged 1.6 and 2.8 mcg/mL, respectively. Skin blister fluid cefpodoxime levels at 12 hours after dosing averaged 0.2 and 0.4 mcg/mL for the 200 mg and 400 mg multiple-dose regimens, respectively.</p><p class="First">Following a single, oral 100 mg Cefpodoxime Proxetil film-coated tablet, the mean maximum cefpodoxime concentration in tonsil tissue averaged 0.24 mcg/g at 4 hours post-dosing and 0.09 mcg/g at 7 hours post-dosing. Equilibrium was achieved between plasma and tonsil tissue within 4 hours of dosing. No detection of cefpodoxime in tonsillar tissue was reported 12 hours after dosing. These results demonstrated that concentrations of cefpodoxime exceeded the MIC<span class="Sub">90</span> of S. pyogenes for at least 7 hours after dosing of 100 mg of Cefpodoxime Proxetil.</p><p class="First">Following a single, oral 200 mg Cefpodoxime Proxetil film-coated tablet, the mean maximum cefpodoxime concentration in lung tissue averaged 0.63 mcg/g at 3 hours post-dosing, 0.52 mcg/g at 6 hours post-dosing, and 0.19 mcg/g at 12 hours post-dosing. The results of this study indicated that cefpodoxime penetrated into lung tissue and produced sustained drug concentrations for at least 12 hours after dosing at levels that exceeded the MIC<span class="Sub">90</span> for <span class="Italics">S. pneumoniae</span> and <span class="Italics">H. influenzae</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adequate data on CSF levels of cefpodoxime are not available.</span></p><h3>Effects of Decreased Renal Function:</h3><p class="First">Elimination of cefpodoxime is reduced in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (&lt;50 mL/min creatinine clearance). (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>.) In subjects with mild impairment of renal function (50 to 80 mL/min creatinine clearance), the average plasma half-life of cefpodoxime was 3.5 hours. In subjects with moderate (30 to 49 mL/min creatinine clearance) or severe renal impairment (5 to 29 mL/min creatinine clearance), the half-life increased to 5.9 and 9.8 hours, respectively. Approximately 23% of the administered dose was cleared from the body during a standard 3 hour hemodialysis procedure.</p><h3>Effect of Hepatic Impairment (cirrhosis):</h3><p class="First">Absorption was somewhat diminished and elimination unchanged in patients with cirrhosis. The mean cefpodoxime T<span class="Sub">1/2</span> and renal clearance in cirrhotic patients were similar to those derived in studies of healthy subjects. Ascites did not appear to affect values in cirrhotic subjects. No dosage adjustment is recommended in this patient population.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics in Elderly Subjects:</h3><p class="First">Elderly subjects do not require dosage adjustments unless they have diminished renal function. (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>.) In healthy geriatric subjects, cefpodoxime half-life in plasma averaged 4.2 hours (vs 3.3 in younger subjects) and urinary recovery averaged 21% after a 400 mg dose was administered every 12 hours. Other pharmacokinetic parameters (C<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC, and T<span class="Sub">max</span>) were unchanged relative to those observed in healthy young subjects.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">Cefpodoxime is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cefpodoxime has activity in the presence of some beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.</p><p class="First">Resistance to Cefpodoxime is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability.</p><p>Cefpodoxime has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections as described in the Indications and Usage (1) section:</p><p><span class="Bold">Gram-positive bacteria:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (methicillin-susceptible strains, including those producing penicillinases)</p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus saprophyticus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> (excluding penicillin-resistant isolates)</p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Gram-negative bacteria:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Proteus mirabilis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span> (including beta-lactamase producing isolates)</p><p><span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span> (including penicillinase-producing isolates)</p><p>The following <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following microorganisms exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for cefpodoxime.

Isolates yielding MIC results other than "Susceptible" should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.</p><p>A report of Susceptible indicates that the antimicrobial is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentration at the infection site necessary to inhibit growth of the pathogen. A report of Intermediate indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where a high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of Resistant indicates that the antimicrobial is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected.</p><p><span class="Bold">Quality Control:</span></p><p>Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individual performing the test<span class="Sup">1,2,3</span>.

When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Cefpodoxime Proxetil is contraindicated in patients with a known allergy to cefpodoxime or to the cephalosporin group of antibiotics.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">BEFORE THERAPY WITH Cefpodoxime Proxetil IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEFPODOXIME, OTHER CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. IF CEFPODOXIME IS TO BE ADMINISTERED TO PENICILLIN SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG BETA-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO Cefpodoxime Proxetil OCCURS, DISCONTINUE THE DRUG. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, INTRAVENOUS ANTIHISTAMINE, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Cefpodoxime Proxetil and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><p>A concerted effort to monitor for <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> in cefpodoxime-treated patients with diarrhea was undertaken because of an increased incidence of diarrhea associated with <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> in early trials in normal subjects. <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> organisms or toxin was reported in 10% of the cefpodoxime-treated adult patients with diarrhea; however, no specific diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis was made in these patients.</p><p>In post-marketing experience outside the United States, reports of pseudomembranous colitis associated with the use of Cefpodoxime Proxetil have been received.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>Warning:</h3><p class="First">This product contains FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.</p><h3>General:</h3><p class="First">In patients with transient or persistent reduction in urinary output due to renal insufficiency, the total daily dose of Cefpodoxime Proxetil should be reduced because high and prolonged serum antibiotic concentrations can occur in such individuals following usual doses. Cefpodoxime, like other cephalosporins, should be administered with caution to patients receiving concurrent treatment with potent diuretics. (See <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>.)</p><p>As with other antibiotics, prolonged use of Cefpodoxime Proxetil may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.</p><p>Prescribing Cefpodoxime Proxetil in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>Information for Patients:</h3><p class="First">Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Cefpodoxime Proxetil should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Cefpodoxime Proxetil is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Cefpodoxime Proxetil or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><h3>Drug Interactions:</h3><p class="First">Antacids: Concomitant administration of high doses of antacids (sodium bicarbonate and aluminum hydroxide) or H2 blockers reduces peak plasma levels by 24% to 42% and the extent of absorption by 27% to 32%, respectively. The rate of absorption is not altered by these concomitant medications. Oral anti-cholinergics (e.g., propantheline) delay peak plasma levels (47% increase in Tmax), but do not affect the extent of absorption (AUC).</p><p>Probenecid: As with other beta-lactam antibiotics, renal excretion of cefpodoxime was inhibited by probenecid and resulted in an approximately 31% increase in AUC and 20% increase in peak cefpodoxime plasma levels.</p><p>Nephrotoxic drugs: Although nephrotoxicity has not been noted when Cefpodoxime Proxetil was given alone, close monitoring of renal function is advised when Cefpodoxime Proxetil is administered concomitantly with compounds of known nephrotoxic potential.</p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions:</h3><p class="First">Cephalosporins, including Cefpodoxime Proxetil, are known to occasionally induce a positive direct Coombs' test.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal carcinogenesis studies of Cefpodoxime Proxetil have not been performed. Mutagenesis studies of cefpodoxime, including the Ames test both with and without metabolic activation, the chromosome aberration test, the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, mitotic recombination and gene conversion, the forward gene mutation assay and the in vivo micronucleus test, were all negative. No untoward effects on fertility or reproduction were noted when 100 mg/kg/day or less (2 times the human dose based on mg/m2) was administered orally to rats.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Cefpodoxime Proxetil was neither teratogenic nor embryocidal when administered to rats during organogenesis at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (2 times the human dose based on mg/m2) or to rabbits at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (1 to 2 times the human dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><p>There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies of Cefpodoxime Proxetil use in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery:</h3><p class="First">Cefpodoxime Proxetil has not been studied for use during labor and delivery. Treatment should only be given if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers:</h3><p class="First">Cefpodoxime is excreted in human milk. In a study of 3 lactating women, levels of cefpodoxime in human milk were 0%, 2% and 6% of concomitant serum levels at 4 hours following a 200 mg oral dose of Cefpodoxime Proxetil. At 6 hours post-dosing, levels were 0%, 9% and 16% of concomitant serum levels. Because of the potential for serious reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use:</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy in infants less than 2 months of age have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use:</h3><p class="First">Of the 3338 patients in multiple-dose clinical studies of Cefpodoxime Proxetil film-coated tablets, 521 (16%) were 65 and over, while 214 (6%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between the elderly and younger patients. In healthy geriatric subjects with normal renal function, cefpodoxime half-life in plasma averaged 4.2 hours and urinary recovery averaged 21% after a 400 mg dose was given every 12 hours for 15 days. Other pharmacokinetic parameters were unchanged relative to those observed in healthy younger subjects.</p><p>Dose adjustment in elderly patients with normal renal function is not necessary.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials:</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials using <span class="Bold">multiple doses</span> of Cefpodoxime Proxetil film-coated tablets, 4696 patients were treated with the recommended dosages of cefpodoxime (100 to 400 mg Q 12 hours). There were no deaths or permanent disabilities thought related to drug toxicity. One- hundred twenty-nine (2.7%) patients discontinued medication due to adverse events thought possibly or probably related to drug toxicity. Ninety-three (52%) of the 178 patients who discontinued therapy (whether thought related to drug therapy or not) did so because of gastrointestinal disturbances, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The percentage of Cefpodoxime Proxetil-treated patients who discontinued study drug because of adverse events was significantly greater at a dose of 800 mg daily than at a dose of 400 mg daily or at a dose of 200 mg daily.
