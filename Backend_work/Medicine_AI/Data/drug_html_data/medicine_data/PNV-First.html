</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Description:</span> PNV-First is a prescription prenatal dietary supplement that contains multivitamins and minerals, which are delivered in a dark amber, oval-shaped softgel capsule imprinted with “350” on one side.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">SUPPLEMENT FACTS<br/>
Each Softgel Contains</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Other Ingredients:</span> bovine gelatin, caramel, glycerin, lecithin, purified water and white beeswax.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Indications and Usage:</span> PNV-First is indicated to provide vitamin, mineral and omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplementation prior to conception, throughout pregnancy and during the postnatal period for the lactating and non-lactating mother, including individuals with know allergies to fish. PNV-First does not contain fish, fish oils, fish proteins or fish byproducts.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Contraindications:</span> PNV-First is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients. Folic Acid is contraindicated in patients with untreated and uncomplicated pernicious anemia, and in those with anaphylactic sensitivity to folic acid. Iron therapy is contraindicated in patients with hemochromatosis and patients with iron storage desease or the potential for iron storage disease due to chronic hemolytic anemia (e.g., inherited anomalies of hemoglobin structure or synthesis and/or red cell enzyme deficiencies, etc.), pyrodoxine responsive anemia, or cirrhosis of the liver. Cyanocobalamin is contraindicated in patients with sensitivity to cobalt or to cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Warning:</span> Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Warnings and Precautions:</span> PNV-First should be used with caution in those with known sensitivity or allergy to soy. Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperthyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure and increased risk of heart disease can occur.</p><p>Iodine should be used with caution in patients with an overactive thyroid.</p><p>Prolonged use of iron salts may produce iron storage disease. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.</p><p>The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency.</p><p>Consumption of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day from all sources may lead to excessive bleeding. Supplemental intake of omega-3 fatty acids such as DHA exceeding 2 grams per day is not recommended. Avoid Overdosage.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span> Medications for an overactive thyroid (anti-thyroid drugs) used in conjunction with iodine supplementation may lead to hypothyroidism. Medications for hypertension used in conjunction with iodine supplementation may increase potassium. High dosages of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of the anticonvulsant drugs: carbamazapine, fosphenytoin, phenyltoin, phenoberbitol, valproic acid. Folic acid may decrease a patient’s response to methotrexate. Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with large amounts of calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones.</p><p>Zinc can inhibit the absorption of certain antibiotics. Take at least 2 hours apart to minimize interactions. Consult appropriate references for additional specific vitamin-drug interactions.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Information for Patients:</span> Patients should be counseled to disclose all medical conditions, including use of all medications, vitamins and supplements, pregnancy and breast-feeding.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> Not recommended for pediatric use.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions:</span> Adverse reactions have been reported with specific vitamins and minerals, but generally at doses substantially higher than those in PNV-First.
