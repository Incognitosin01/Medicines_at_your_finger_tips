Invert and shake well until dissolved. The resulting solution should be clear, colorless, and particle free. A small amount of liquid will remain in the vial after withdrawing the 0.5 mL dose.</p><p>Nimenrix [Canadian product]: Add entire contents of prefilled syringe containing diluent to the vial containing powder.

Withdraw solution from vial using new needle.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IM: Administer by IM route, preferably into the central deltoid region. Do not administer via IV, SubQ, or intradermal route. Do not mix with other vaccines or injections; separate needles and syringes should be used for each injection. To prevent syncope related injuries, patients should be vaccinated while seated or lying down (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). US law requires that the date of administration, the vaccine manufacturer, lot number of vaccine, Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) edition date and date it was provided, and the administering person's name, title, and address be recorded.</p><p>For patients at risk of hemorrhage, the vaccine should be administered intramuscularly if, in the opinion of a physician familiar with the patient's bleeding risk, the vaccine can be administered by this route with reasonable safety. If the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, intramuscular vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered. A fine needle (23 gauge or smaller) can be used for the vaccination and firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. The patient or family should be instructed concerning the risk of hematoma from the injection. Patients on anticoagulant therapy should be considered to have the same bleeding risks and treated as those with clotting factor disorders (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>For IM administration only. Based on limited data, inadvertent SubQ administration provides a lower serologic response; however, the response is still considered to be protective. If inadvertently administered by the SubQ route, revaccination is not necessary.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Menactra, MenQuadfi: Store between 2°C to 8°C (35°F to 46°F); do not freeze.

Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever); vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with a history of bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia); bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; if the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM injection can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Guillain-Barré syndrome: Has been temporally associated with Menactra; use with caution in patients with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome.</p><p>• Meningococcal infections: Not to be used to treat meningococcal infections or to provide immunity against <i>N. meningitidis</i> serogroup B or diphtheria.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Anticoagulant therapy: Use with caution in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy; bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist. The ACIP prefers each dose of a specific vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer when possible; however, vaccination should not be deferred because a specific brand name is unavailable (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>Administration of Menactra (MenACWY-D) one month after Daptacel (DTaP) has been shown to have reduced meningococcal antibody responses in children; for children ages 2 through 6 years, these vaccines should be administered simultaneously or Menactra should be administered prior to or 6 months after Daptacel. This interaction does not apply to Menveo (MenACWY-CRM) (CDC/ACIP [Cohn 2013]).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Patients with certain complement deficiencies and patients receiving treatment that inhibits terminal complement activation (eg, eculizumab, ravulizumab) are at an increased risk for invasive meningococcal infection, including post-vaccination. Consider deferring immunization during periods of severe immunosuppression (eg, patients receiving chemo/radiation therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy [including high-dose corticosteroids]); may have a reduced response to vaccination. In general, household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive all age appropriate vaccines. Inactivated vaccines should be administered ≥2 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression when feasible; inactivated vaccines administered during chemotherapy should be readministered after immune competence is regained (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p>• Pediatric: Apnea has been reported following IM vaccine administration in premature infants; consider clinical status implications. In general, preterm infants should be vaccinated at the same chronological age as full-term infants (AAP [Saari 2003]; ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). Children with functional or anatomic asplenia should delay receiving Menactra (MenACWY-D) until 2 years of age to avoid immune interference with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13); Menactra should be given at least 4 weeks after completion of the PCV13 series; if meningococcal immunity is required in pediatric patients 2 to 23 months of age, the alternative is administration of Menveo (MenACWY-CRM) (CDC/ACIP [MacNeil 2014]).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Antipyretics: Antipyretics have not been shown to prevent febrile seizures; antipyretics may be used to treat fever or discomfort following vaccination (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). One study reported that routine prophylactic administration of acetaminophen to prevent fever prior to vaccination decreased the immune response of some vaccines; the clinical significance of this reduction in immune response has not been established (Prymula 2009).</p><p>• Appropriate use: Use of this vaccine for specific medical and/or other indications (eg, immunocompromising conditions, hepatic or kidney disease, diabetes) is also addressed in the annual ACIP Recommended Immunization Schedules (refer to CDC schedule for detailed information). Specific recommendations for use of this vaccine in immunocompromised patients with asplenia, cancer, HIV infection, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, cochlear implants, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (prior to or after), sickle cell disease, solid organ transplant (prior to or after), or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for chronic conditions are available from the IDSA (Rubin 2014).</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Tetanus vaccine: MenQuadfi and Nimenrix (Canadian product) are not a substitute for routine tetanus immunization.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor for hypersensitivity and syncope for at least 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Based on available data, an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes has not been observed following maternal vaccination with a meningococcal (Groups A / C / Y and W-135) diphtheria conjugate vaccine (Becerra-Culqui 2020; Myers 2017; Zheteyeva 2013).</p><p>Inactivated bacterial vaccines have not been shown to cause increased risks to the fetus. Use of meningococcal conjugate vaccines may be considered for use in pregnant women at increased risk of infection (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). Pregnancy should not preclude vaccination if otherwise indicated (CDC/ACIP [Cohn 2013]).</p><p>Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes following exposure to Menactra or MenQuadfi is ongoing. Health care providers are encouraged to enroll females exposed to Menactra or MedQuadfi during pregnancy in the Sanofi Pasteur Inc vaccine registry (1-800-822-2463).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to prevent meningococcal disease.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
