Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5)</span>].</p><p>These doses can be given without regard to timing of meals.</p><h3>Osteoarthritis</h3><p class="First">For OA, the dosage is 200 mg per day administered as a single dose or as 100 mg twice daily.</p><h3>Rheumatoid Arthritis</h3><p class="First">For RA, the dosage is 100 to 200 mg twice daily.</p><h3>Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis</h3><p class="First">For JRA, the dosage for pediatric patients (age 2 years and older) is based on weight. For patients &gt;10 kg to &lt;25 kg the recommended dose is 50 mg twice daily. For patients &gt;25 kg the recommended dose is 100 mg twice daily.</p><p>For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, the contents of a celecoxib capsule can be added to applesauce. The entire capsule contents are carefully emptied onto a level teaspoon of cool or room temperature applesauce and ingested immediately with water. The sprinkled capsule contents on applesauce are stable for up to 6 hours under refrigerated conditions (2 to 8° C/ 35 to 45° F).</p><h3>Ankylosing Spondylitis</h3><p class="First">For AS, the dosage of celecoxib is 200 mg daily in single (once per day) or divided (twice per day) doses. If no effect is observed after 6 weeks, a trial of 400 mg daily may be worthwhile. If no effect is observed after 6 weeks on 400 mg daily, a response is not likely and consideration should be given to alternate treatment options.</p><h3>Management of Acute Pain and Treatment of Primary Dysmenorrhea</h3><p class="First">For management of Acute Pain and Treatment of Primary Dysmenorrhea, the dosage is 400 mg initially, followed by an additional 200 mg dose if needed on the first day. On subsequent days, the recommended dose is 200 mg twice daily as needed.</p><h3>Special Populations</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></span></p><p>In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the dose by 50%. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates</span></span></p><p>In adult patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin), initiate treatment with half of the lowest recommended dose.</p><p>In patients with JRA who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers, consider using alternative treatments. [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific populations (8.8), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)</span>].</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Celecoxib capsules:<br/>

Severe, sometimes fatal, anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs, have been        reported in such patients [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8)</span>].</p><p>·               In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and  Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><p>·               In patients who have demonstrated allergic-type reactions to sulfonamides.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</p><p>In the APC (Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib) trial, there was about a threefold increased risk of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke for celecoxib 400 mg twice daily and celecoxib 200 mg twice daily treatment arms compared to placebo. The increases in both celecoxib dose groups versus placebo-treated patients were mainly due to an increased incidence of myocardial infarction [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14.7)</span>].</p><p>A randomized controlled trial entitled the Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety vs. Ibuprofen Or Naproxen (PRECISION) was conducted to assess the relative cardiovascular thrombotic risk of a COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, compared to the non-selective NSAIDs naproxen and ibuprofen. Celecoxib 100 mg twice daily was non-inferior to naproxen 375 to 500 mg twice daily and ibuprofen 600 to 800 mg three times daily for the composite endpoint of the Antiplatelet Trialists’ Collaboration (APTC), which consists of cardiovascular death (including hemorrhagic death), non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [<span class="Italics">See Clinical Studies (14.6)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p><p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as celecoxib, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</span></span></p><p>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Post-MI Patients</span></span></p><p>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</p><p>Avoid the use of celecoxib in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If celecoxib is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</h3><p class="First"> NSAIDs, including celecoxib cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with celecoxib. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.  </p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation<br/></span></span> Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants; or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</p><p>Complicated and symptomatic ulcer rates were 0.78% at nine months for all patients in the CLASS trial, and 2.19% for the subgroup on low-dose ASA. Patients 65 years of age and older had an incidence of 1.40% at nine months, 3.06% when also taking ASA [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14.7)</span>]. </p><p><span class="Bold">Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:<br/></span> •  Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.<br/>
•  Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.<br/>
•  Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.<br/>
•  Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue celecoxib until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.<br/>
•  In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.</p><p>Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including celecoxib.</p><p>In controlled clinical trials of celecoxib, the incidence of borderline elevations (greater than or equal to 1.2 times and less than 3 times the upper limit of normal) of liver associated enzymes was 6% for celecoxib and 5% for placebo, and approximately 0.2% of patients taking celecoxib and 0.3% of patients taking placebo had notable elevations of ALT and AST.</p><p>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and “flu-like” symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue celecoxib immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including celecoxib, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p>See <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)</span> for additional blood pressure data for celecoxib.</p><p>Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><h3>Heart Failure and Edema</h3><p class="First">The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately twofold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</p><p>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of celecoxib may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>In the CLASS study [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14.7)</span>], the Kaplan-Meier cumulative rates at 9 months of peripheral edema in patients on celecoxib 400 mg twice daily (4-fold and 2-fold the recommended OA and RA doses, respectively), ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily and diclofenac 75 mg twice daily were 4.5%, 6.9% and 4.7%, respectively.</p><p>Avoid the use of celecoxib in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If celecoxib is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Renal Toxicity</span></span></p><p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.</p><p>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia<span class="Bold">,</span> heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE-inhibitors or the ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of celecoxib may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.</p><p>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating celecoxib. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of celecoxib [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span> Avoid the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If celecoxib is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hyperkalemia</span></span></p><p>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Celecoxib has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to celecoxib and in patients with aspirin sensitive asthma. Celecoxib is a sulfonamide and both NSAIDs and sulfonamides may cause allergic type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>].</p><p>Seek emergency help if any anaphylactic reaction occurs.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, celecoxib is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>]. When celecoxib is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious skin reactions have occurred following treatment with celecoxib, including erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). These serious events may occur without warning and can be fatal.</p><p>Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of celecoxib at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Celecoxib is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><h3>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">Celecoxib may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including celecoxib, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>].</p><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with celecoxib has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.</p><p>In controlled clinical trials the incidence of anemia was 0.6% with celecoxib and 0.4% with placebo. Patients on long-term treatment with celecoxib should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia or blood loss.</p><p>NSAIDs, including celecoxib, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><h3>Masking of Inflammation and Fever</h3><p class="First">The pharmacological activity of celecoxib in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><h3>Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)</span>].</p><p>In controlled clinical trials, elevated BUN occurred more frequently in patients receiving celecoxib compared with patients on placebo. This laboratory abnormality was also seen in patients who received comparator NSAIDs in these studies. The clinical significance of this abnormality has not been established.</p><h3>Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)</h3><p class="First">Because of the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation with use of celecoxib in pediatric patients with systemic onset JRA, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of abnormal clotting or bleeding, and inform patients and their caregivers to report symptoms as soon as possible.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><p>·           Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]</p><p>·           GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]</p><p>·           Hepatotoxicity [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>]</p><p>·           Hypertension [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>]</p><p>·           Heart Failure and Edema [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span>]</p><p>·           Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span>]</p><p>·           Anaphylactic Reactions [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</span>]</p><p>·           Serious Skin Reactions [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)</span>]</p><p>·           Hematologic Toxicity [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)</span>]</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.</p><p>Of the celecoxib-treated patients in the pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, approximately 4,250 were patients with OA, approximately 2,100 were patients with RA, and approximately 1,050 were patients with post-surgical pain. More than 8,500 patients received a total daily dose of celecoxib of 200 mg (100 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily) or more, including more than 400 treated at 800 mg (400 mg twice daily). Approximately 3,900 patients received celecoxib at these doses for 6 months or more; approximately 2,300 of these have received it for 1 year or more and 124 of these have received it for 2 years or more.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pre-marketing Controlled Arthritis Trials</span></span></p><p>Table 1 lists all adverse events, regardless of causality, occurring in ≥2% of patients receiving celecoxib from 12 controlled studies conducted in patients with OA or RA that included a placebo and/or a positive control group. Since these 12 trials were of different durations, and patients in the trials may not have been exposed for the same duration of time, these percentages do not capture cumulative rates of occurrence.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Adverse Events Occurring in ≥2% of Celecoxib Patients from Pre-marketing Controlled Arthritis Trials</span></p><p>CBX = Celecoxib 100 to 200 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily; NAP = Naproxen 500 mg twice daily; DCF = Diclofenac 75 mg twice daily; IBU = Ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily.</p><p>In placebo- or active-controlled clinical trials, the discontinuation rate due to adverse events was 7.1% for patients receiving celecoxib and 6.1% for patients receiving placebo.

Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2 to 4% for major malformations, and 15 to 20% for pregnancy loss. In animal reproduction studies, embryo-fetal deaths and an increase in diaphragmatic hernias were observed in rats administered celecoxib daily during the period of organogenesis at oral doses approximately 6 times the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mg twice daily. In addition, structural abnormalities (e.g., septal defects, ribs fused, sternebrae fused and sternebrae misshapen) were observed in rabbits given daily oral doses of celecoxib during the period of organogenesis at approximately 2 times the MRHD [see Data]. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization.

The calculated average daily infant dose was 10 to 40 mcg/kg/day, less than 1% of the weight-based therapeutic dose for a two-year old-child. A report of two breastfed infants 17 and 22 months of age did not show any adverse events. Caution should be exercised when celecoxib is administered to a nursing woman. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for celecoxib and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the celecoxib or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Infertility</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Females</span></p><p>Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including celecoxib, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women.

Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including celecoxib, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Celecoxib is approved for relief of the signs and symptoms of Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis in patients 2 years and older. Safety and efficacy have not been studied beyond six months in children. The long-term cardiovascular toxicity in children exposed to celecoxib has not been evaluated and it is unknown if long-term risks may be similar to that seen in adults exposed to celecoxib or other COX-2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">(see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.12), and Clinical Studies (14.3)</span>].</p><p>The use of celecoxib in patients 2 years to 17 years of age with pauciarticular, polyarticular course JRA or in patients with systemic onset JRA was studied in a 12-week, double-blind, active controlled, pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy study, with a 12-week open-label extension. Celecoxib has not been studied in patients under the age of 2 years, in patients with body weight less than 10 kg (22 lbs), and in patients with active systemic features. Patients with systemic onset JRA (without active systemic features) appear to be at risk for the development of abnormal coagulation laboratory tests. In some patients with systemic onset JRA, both celecoxib and naproxen were associated with mild prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) but not prothrombin time (PT). When NSAIDs including celecoxib are used in patients with systemic onset JRA, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of abnormal clotting or bleeding, due to the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Patients with systemic onset JRA should be monitored for the development of abnormal coagulation tests [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.12), Adverse Reactions (6.3), Animal Toxicology (13.2), Clinical Studies (14.3)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>Alternative therapies for treatment of JRA should be considered in pediatric patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers [see <span class="Italics">Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (8.8)</span>].</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.13</span>)].</p><p>Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65 to 74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. In clinical studies comparing renal function as measured by the GFR, BUN and creatinine, and platelet function as measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, the results were not different between elderly and young volunteers. However, as with other NSAIDs, including those that selectively inhibit COX-2, there have been more spontaneous post-marketing reports of fatal GI events and acute renal failure in the elderly than in younger patients [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6)</span>].</p><h3>Hepatic Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">The daily recommended dose of celecoxib capsules in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced by 50%. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Celecoxib is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates</h3><p class="First">In patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (i.e., CYP2C9*3/*3), based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin) administer celecoxib starting with half the lowest recommended dose. Alternative management should be considered in JRA patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers. [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)</span>].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occured, but were rare [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6)</span>].</p><p>No overdoses of celecoxib were reported during clinical trials. Doses up to 2400 mg/day for up to 10 days in 12 patients did not result in serious toxicity. No information is available regarding the removal of celecoxib by hemodialysis, but based on its high degree of plasma protein binding (&gt;97%) dialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose.</p><p>Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</p><p>For additional information about overdosage treatment contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222).</p><h2>Celexib 100- EZS Description</h2><p class="First">Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, available as capsules containing 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg celecoxib for oral administration.

Celecoxib concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Since celecoxib is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Platelets</span></span></p><p>In clinical trials using normal volunteers, celecoxib at single doses up to 800 mg and multiple doses of 600 mg twice daily for up to 7 days duration (higher than recommended therapeutic doses) had no effect on reduction of platelet aggregation or increase in bleeding time. Because of its lack of platelet effects, celecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis. It is not known if there are any effects of celecoxib on platelets that may contribute to the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic adverse events associated with the use of celecoxib.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Fluid Retention</span></span></p><p>Inhibition of PGE2 synthesis may lead to sodium and water retention through increased reabsorption in the renal medullary thick ascending loop of Henle and perhaps other segments of the distal nephron. In the collecting ducts, PGE2 appears to inhibit water reabsorption by counteracting the action of antidiuretic hormone.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Celecoxib exhibits dose-proportional increase in exposure after oral administration up to 200 mg twice daily and less than proportional increase at higher doses. It has extensive distribution and high protein binding. It is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 with a half-life of approximately 11 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></span></p><p>Peak plasma levels of celecoxib occur approximately 3 hrs after an oral dose. Under fasting conditions, both peak plasma levels (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and area under the curve (AUC) are roughly dose-proportional up to 200 mg twice daily; at higher doses there are less than proportional increases in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC <span class="Italics">[see Food Effects]</span>. Absolute bioavailability studies have not been conducted. With multiple dosing, steady-state conditions are reached on or before Day 5. The pharmacokinetic parameters of celecoxib in a group of healthy subjects are shown in Table 4. </p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4 Summary of Single Dose (200 mg) Disposition Kinetics of Celecoxib in</span> <span class="Bold">Healthy Subjects<span class="Sup">1 </span></span></p><p><span class="Sup">1</span>Subjects under fasting conditions (n=36, 19 to52 yrs.)</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Food Effects</span></span></p><p>When celecoxib capsules were taken with a high fat meal, peak plasma levels were delayed for about 1 to 2 hours with an increase in total absorption (AUC) of 10% to 20%. Under fasting conditions, at doses above 200 mg, there is less than a proportional increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC, which is thought to be due to the low solubility of the drug in aqueous media.  </p><p>Coadministration of celecoxib with an aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids resulted in a reduction in plasma celecoxib concentrations with a decrease of 37% in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and 10% in AUC. Celecoxib, at doses up to 200 mg twice daily, can be administered without regard to timing of meals. Higher doses (400 mg twice daily) should be administered with food to improve absorption.  </p><p>In healthy adult volunteers, the overall systemic exposure (AUC) of celecoxib was equivalent when celecoxib was administered as intact capsule or capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce. There were no significant alterations in C<span class="Sub">max</span>, T<span class="Sub">max</span> or t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> after administration of capsule contents on applesauce [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></span></p><p>In healthy subjects, celecoxib is highly protein bound (~97%) within the clinical dose range. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicate that celecoxib binds primarily to albumin and, to a lesser extent, α<span class="Sub">1</span>-acid glycoprotein. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state (V<span class="Sub">ss</span>/F) is approximately 400 L, suggesting extensive distribution into the tissues. Celecoxib is not preferentially bound to red blood cells.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Elimination</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Celecoxib metabolism is primarily mediated via CYP2C9. Three metabolites, a primary alcohol, the corresponding carboxylic acid and its glucuronide conjugate, have been identified in human plasma. These metabolites are inactive as COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors. </p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Celecoxib is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism with little (&lt;3%) unchanged drug recovered in the urine and feces. Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled drug, approximately 57% of the dose was excreted in the feces and 27% was excreted into the urine. The primary metabolite in both urine and feces was the carboxylic acid metabolite (73% of dose) with low amounts of the glucuronide also appearing in the urine.
