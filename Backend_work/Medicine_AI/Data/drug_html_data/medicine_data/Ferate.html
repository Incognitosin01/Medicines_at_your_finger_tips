Myoglobin helps your muscle cells store oxygen.</p><p>Ferate is used to treat or prevent iron deficiency anemia (a lack of red blood cells caused by having too little iron in the body).</p><p>Ferate may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use  Ferate if you have hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis, or hemolytic anemia.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Ferate if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p><ul>
