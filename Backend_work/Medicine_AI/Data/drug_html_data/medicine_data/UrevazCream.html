Each gram of Urea Cream, 44 % contains 44% urea, edetate disodium dihydrate, glycerin, hydroxethylcellulose, PEG-6 caprylic/capric glyceride, purified water,phenoxyethanol,ethylexylglycerin and xanthan gum. Urea is a diamide of carbonic acid with the following chemical structure:</p><p></p><h2>Urevaz Cream - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Urea gently dissolves the intercellular matrix which results in loosening the horny layer of skin and shedding scaly skin at regular intervals, thereby softening hyperkeratotic areas. Urea also hydrates and gently dissolves the intercellular matrix of the nail plate, which can result in the softening and eventual debridement of the nail plate.</p><h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2><p class="First">The mechanism of action of topically applied urea is not yet known.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USES</h2><p class="First">For debridement and promotion of normal healing of hyperkeratotic surface lesions, particularly where healing is retarded by local infection, necrotic tissue, fibrinous or prurient debris or eschar. Urea is useful for the treatment of hyperkeratotic conditions such as dry, rough skin, dermatitis, psoriasis, xerosis, ichthyosis, eczema, keratosis, keratoderma, corns and calluses, as well as damaged, ingrown and devitalized nails.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Known hypersensitivity to any of the listed ingredients.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">For external use only.
