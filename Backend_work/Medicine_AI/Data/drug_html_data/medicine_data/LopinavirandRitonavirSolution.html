Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.</li>
<li>Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of lopinavir and ritonavir.</li>
<li>Loss of therapeutic effect of lopinavir and ritonavir and possible development of resistance.</li>
</ul><p>See Table 12 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (<span class="Italics">7</span></span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during lopinavir and ritonavir therapy; review concomitant medications during lopinavir and ritonavir therapy, and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (<span class="Italics">4</span></span><span class="Italics">)</span> and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (<span class="Italics">7</span></span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>Toxicity in Preterm Neonates</h3><p class="First">Lopinavir and ritonavir oral solution contains the excipients ethanol, approximately 42% (v/v) and propylene glycol, approximately 15% (w/v). When administered concomitantly with propylene glycol, ethanol competitively inhibits the metabolism of propylene glycol, which may lead to elevated concentrations. Preterm neonates may be at increased risk of propylene glycol-associated adverse events due to diminished ability to metabolize propylene glycol, thereby leading to accumulation and potential adverse events. Postmarketing life-threatening cases of cardiac toxicity (including complete AV block, bradycardia, and cardiomyopathy), lactic acidosis, acute renal failure, CNS depression and respiratory complications leading to death have been reported, predominantly in preterm neonates receiving lopinavir and ritonavir oral solution.</p><p>Lopinavir and ritonavir oral solution should not be used in preterm neonates in the immediate postnatal period because of possible toxicities. A safe and effective dose of lopinavir and ritonavir oral solution in this patient population has not been established. However, if the benefit of using lopinavir and ritonavir oral solution to treat HIV infection in infants immediately after birth outweighs the potential risks, infants should be monitored closely for increases in serum osmolality and serum creatinine, and for toxicity related to lopinavir and ritonavir oral solution including: hyperosmolality, with or without lactic acidosis, renal toxicity, CNS depression (including stupor, coma, and apnea), seizures, hypotonia, cardiac arrhythmias and ECG changes, and hemolysis. Total amounts of ethanol and propylene glycol from all medicines that are to be given to infants should be taken into account in order to avoid toxicity from these excipients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><h3>Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Pancreatitis has been observed in patients receiving lopinavir and ritonavir therapy, including those who developed marked triglyceride elevations. In some cases, fatalities have been observed. Although a causal relationship to lopinavir and ritonavir has not been established, marked triglyceride elevations are a risk factor for development of pancreatitis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]</span>. Patients with advanced HIV-1 disease may be at increased risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis, and patients with a history of pancreatitis may be at increased risk for recurrence during lopinavir and ritonavir therapy.</p><p>Pancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) or abnormalities in laboratory values (such as increased serum lipase or amylase values) suggestive of pancreatitis occur. Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and lopinavir and ritonavir and/or other antiretroviral therapy should be suspended as clinically appropriate.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C or marked elevations in transaminase prior to treatment may be at increased risk for developing or worsening of transaminase elevations or hepatic decompensation with use of lopinavir and ritonavir.</p><p>There have been postmarketing reports of hepatic dysfunction, including some fatalities. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease taking multiple concomitant medications in the setting of underlying chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. A causal relationship with lopinavir and ritonavir therapy has not been established.</p><p>Elevated transaminases with or without elevated bilirubin levels have been reported in HIV-1 mono-infected and uninfected patients as early as 7 days after the initiation of lopinavir and ritonavir in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. In some cases, the hepatic dysfunction was serious; however, a definitive causal relationship with lopinavir and ritonavir therapy has not been established.</p><p>Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with lopinavir and ritonavir and patients should be monitored closely during treatment. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in the patients with underlying chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, especially during the first several months of lopinavir and ritonavir treatment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</span></p><h3>QT Interval Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Postmarketing cases of QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes have been reported although causality of lopinavir and ritonavir could not be established. Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, those with hypokalemia, and with other drugs that prolong the QT interval <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>PR Interval Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Lopinavir and ritonavir prolongs the PR interval in some patients. Cases of second or third degree atrioventricular block have been reported. Lopinavir and ritonavir should be used with caution in patients with underlying structural heart disease, pre-existing conduction system abnormalities, ischemic heart disease or cardiomyopathies, as these patients may be at increased risk for developing cardiac conduction abnormalities.</p><p>The impact on the PR interval of co-administration of lopinavir and ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (including calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, digoxin and atazanavir) has not been evaluated. As a result, co-administration of lopinavir and ritonavir with these drugs should be undertaken with caution, particularly with those drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Clinical monitoring is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia</h3><p class="First">New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in HIV-1 infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established. Consider monitoring for hyperglycemia, new onset diabetes mellitus or an exacerbation of diabetes mellitus in patients treated with lopinavir and ritonavir.</p><h3>Immune Reconstitution Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lopinavir and ritonavir. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium avium</span> infection, cytomegalovirus, <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span> pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis) which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.</p><p>Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.</p><h3>Lipid Elevations</h3><p class="First">Treatment with lopinavir and ritonavir has resulted in large increases in the concentration of total cholesterol and triglycerides <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior to initiating lopinavir and ritonavir therapy and at periodic intervals during therapy. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate, taking into account any potential drug-drug interactions with lopinavir and ritonavir and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Fat Redistribution</h3><p class="First">Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.</p><h3>Patients with Hemophilia</h3><p class="First">Increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis have been reported in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced. A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established.</p><h3>Resistance/Cross-resistance</h3><p class="First">Because the potential for HIV cross-resistance among protease inhibitors has not been fully explored in lopinavir and ritonavir-treated patients, it is unknown what effect therapy with lopinavir and ritonavir will have on the activity of subsequently administered protease inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling.</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Adults</span></p><p>The safety of lopinavir and ritonavir has been investigated in about 2,600 patients in Phase II-IV clinical trials, of which about 700 have received a dose of 800/200 mg (6 capsules or 4 tablets) once daily. Along with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), in some studies, lopinavir and ritonavir was used in combination with efavirenz or nevirapine.</p><p>In clinical studies the incidence of diarrhea in patients treated with either lopinavir and ritonavir capsules or tablets was greater in those patients treated once daily than in those patients treated twice daily. Any grade of diarrhea was reported by at least half of patients taking once daily lopinavir and ritonavir capsules or tablets. At the time of treatment discontinuation, 4.2-6.3% of patients taking once daily lopinavir and ritonavir and 1.8-3.7% of those taking twice daily lopinavir and ritonavir reported ongoing diarrhea.</p><p>Commonly reported adverse reactions to lopinavir and ritonavir included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia. Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting may occur at the beginning of the treatment while hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia may occur later.

Agents that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A and have high first pass metabolism appear to be the most susceptible to large increases in AUC (&gt; 3-fold) when co-administered with lopinavir and ritonavir. Thus, co-administration of lopinavir and ritonavir with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated. Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 12.</p><p>Additionally, lopinavir and ritonavir induces glucuronidation.</p><p>Published data suggest that lopinavir is an inhibitor of OATP1B1.</p><p>These examples are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with lopinavir and ritonavir.

Dose selection for patients 6 months to 12 years of age was based on the following results. The 230/57.5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>oral solution twice daily regimen without nevirapine and the 300/75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> oral solution twice daily regimen with nevirapine provided lopinavir plasma concentrations similar to those obtained in adult patients receiving the 400/100 mg twice daily regimen (without nevirapine) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.4)]</span>.</p><p>A prospective multicenter, open-label trial evaluated the pharmacokinetic profile, tolerability, safety and efficacy of high-dose lopinavir and ritonavir with or without concurrent NNRTI therapy (Group 1: 400/100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily + ≥ 2 NRTIs; Group 2: 480/120 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily + ≥ 1 NRTI + 1 NNRTI) in 26 children and adolescents ≥ 2 years to &lt; 18 years of age who had failed prior therapy. Patients also had saquinavir mesylate added to their regimen. This strategy was intended to assess whether higher than approved doses of lopinavir and ritonavir could overcome protease inhibitor cross-resistance. High doses of lopinavir and ritonavir exhibited a safety profile similar to those observed in previous trials; changes in HIV-1 RNA were less than anticipated; three patients had HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/mL at Week 48.  CD4+ cell count increases were noted in the eight patients who remained on treatment for 48 weeks <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of lopinavir and ritonavir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, appropriate caution should be exercised in the administration and monitoring of lopinavir and ritonavir in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Lopinavir and ritonavir is principally metabolized by the liver; therefore, caution should be exercised when administering this drug to patients with hepatic impairment, because lopinavir concentrations may be increased <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdoses with lopinavir and ritonavir oral solution have been reported. One of these reports described fatal cardiogenic shock in a 2.1 kg infant who received a single dose of 6.5 mL of lopinavir and ritonavir oral solution (520 mg lopinavir, approximately 10-fold above the recommended lopinavir dose) nine days prior. The following events have been reported in association with unintended overdoses in preterm neonates: complete AV block, cardiomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and acute renal failure <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>. Healthcare professionals should be aware that lopinavir and ritonavir oral solution is highly concentrated and therefore, should pay special attention to accurate calculation of the dose of lopinavir and ritonavir, transcription of the medication order, dispensing information and dosing instructions to minimize the risk for medication errors and overdose. This is especially important for infants and young children.</p><p>Lopinavir and ritonavir oral solution contains approximately 42% (v/v) ethanol and approximately 15% (w/v) propylene glycol. Ingestion of the product over the recommended dose by an infant or a young child could result in significant toxicity and could potentially be lethal.</p><p>Human experience of acute overdosage with lopinavir and ritonavir is limited. Treatment of overdose with lopinavir and ritonavir should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. There is no specific antidote for overdose with lopinavir and ritonavir. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by gastric lavage. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in removal of unabsorbed drug. Since lopinavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the drug. However, dialysis can remove both ethanol and propylene glycol in the case of overdose with lopinavir and ritonavir oral solution.</p><h2>Lopinavir and Ritonavir Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Lopinavir and Ritonavir Oral Solution USP is a co-formulation of lopinavir and ritonavir. Lopinavir is an inhibitor of the HIV-1 protease.

Virologic response to lopinavir and ritonavir therapy with respect to phenotypic susceptibility to lopinavir at baseline was examined in Study 957.  In this study 56 NNRTI-naïve patients with HIV-1 RNA &gt;1,000 copies/mL despite previous therapy with at least two protease inhibitors selected from indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir were randomized to receive one of two doses of lopinavir and ritonavir in combination with efavirenz and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The EC<span class="Sub">50</span> values of lopinavir against the 56 baseline viral isolates ranged from 0.5- to 96-fold the wild-type EC<span class="Sub">50</span> value. Fifty-five percent (31/56) of these baseline isolates displayed &gt;4-fold reduced susceptibility to lopinavir. These 31 isolates had a median reduction in lopinavir susceptibility of 18-fold.
