Because of this risk and because, when it is effective, SABRIL provides an observable symptomatic benefit; patient response and continued need for treatment should be periodically assessed.</p><p>Based upon adult studies, 30 percent or more of patients can be affected with bilateral concentric visual field constriction ranging in severity from mild to severe. Severe cases may be characterized by tunnel vision to within 10 degrees of visual fixation, which can result in disability. In some cases, SABRIL also can damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity. Symptoms of vision loss from SABRIL are unlikely to be recognized by patients or caregivers before vision loss is severe. Vision loss of milder severity, while often unrecognized by the patient or caregiver, can still adversely affect function.</p><p>Because assessing vision may be difficult in infants and children, the frequency and extent of vision loss is poorly characterized in these patients. For this reason, the understanding of the risk is primarily based on the adult experience. The possibility that vision loss from SABRIL may be more common, more severe, or have more severe functional consequences in infants and children than in adults cannot be excluded.</p><p>The onset of vision loss from SABRIL is unpredictable and can occur within weeks of starting treatment or sooner, or at any time after starting treatment, even after months or years.</p><p>The risk of vision loss increases with increasing dose and cumulative exposure, but there is no dose or exposure known to be free of risk of vision loss.</p><p>In patients with refractory complex partial seizures, SABRIL should be withdrawn if a substantial clinical benefit is not observed within 3 months of initiating treatment. If, in the clinical judgment of the prescriber, evidence of treatment failure becomes obvious earlier than 3 months, treatment should be discontinued at that time <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><p>In patients with infantile spasms, SABRIL should be withdrawn if a substantial clinical benefit is not observed within 2 to 4 weeks. If, in the clinical judgment of the prescriber, evidence of treatment failure becomes obvious earlier than 2 to 4 weeks, treatment should be discontinued at that time <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].</span></p><p>SABRIL should not be used in patients with, or at high risk of, other types of irreversible vision loss unless the benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the risks. The interaction of other types of irreversible vision damage with vision damage from SABRIL has not been well-characterized, but is likely adverse.</p><p>SABRIL should not be used with other drugs associated with serious adverse ophthalmic effects such as retinopathy or glaucoma unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.</p><p><span class="Bold">Monitoring of Vision</span></p><p>Monitoring of vision by an ophthalmic professional with expertise in visual field interpretation and the ability to perform dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy of the retina is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span> Because vision testing in infants is difficult, vision loss may not be detected until it is severe. For patients receiving SABRIL, vision assessment is recommended at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting SABRIL), at least every 3 months while on therapy, and about 3-6 months after the discontinuation of therapy.  The diagnostic approach should be individualized for the patient and clinical situation.   </p><p>In adults and cooperative pediatric patients, perimetry is recommended, preferably by automated threshold visual field testing.  Additional testing may also include electrophysiology (e.g., electroretinography [ERG]), retinal imaging (e.g., optical coherence tomography [OCT]), and/or other methods appropriate for the patient. In patients who cannot be tested, treatment may continue according to clinical judgment, with appropriate patient counseling. Because of variability, results from ophthalmic monitoring must be interpreted with caution, and repeat assessment is recommended if results are abnormal or uninterpretable. Repeat assessment in the first few weeks of treatment is recommended to establish if, and to what degree, reproducible results can be obtained, and to guide selection of appropriate ongoing monitoring for the patient.</p><p>The onset and progression of vision loss from SABRIL is unpredictable, and it may occur or worsen precipitously between assessments. Once detected, vision loss due to SABRIL is not reversible. It is expected that even with frequent monitoring, some SABRIL patients will develop severe vision loss. Consider drug discontinuation, balancing benefit and risk, if vision loss is documented. It is possible that vision loss can worsen despite discontinuation of SABRIL.</p><h3>5.2 Vigabatrin REMS Program</h3><p class="First">SABRIL is available only through a restricted distribution program called the Vigabatrin REMS Program, because of the risk of permanent vision loss.</p><p>Notable requirements of the Vigabatrin REMS Program include the following:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>
<p class="First">Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the program, agreeing to counsel patients on the risk of vision loss and the need for periodic monitoring of vision, and reporting any event suggestive of vision loss to Lundbeck.</p>

<li>
<p class="First">Patients must enroll in the program.  </p>

In this study, in post marketing experience, and in published literature reports, these changes generally resolved with discontinuation of treatment. In a few patients, the lesion resolved despite continued use.  It has been reported that some infants exhibited coincident motor abnormalities, but no causal relationship has been established and the potential for long-term clinical sequelae has not been adequately studied.</p><p>Neurotoxicity (brain histopathology and neurobehavioral abnormalities) was observed in rats exposed to vigabatrin during late gestation and the neonatal and juvenile periods of development, and brain histopathological changes were observed in dogs exposed to vigabatrin during the juvenile period of development. The relationship between these findings and the abnormal MRI findings in infants treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms is unknown <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p>The specific pattern of signal changes observed in patients 6 years and younger was not observed in older pediatric and adult patients treated with vigabatrin. In a blinded review of MRI images obtained in prospective clinical trials in patients with refractory complex partial seizures (CPS) 3 years and older (N=656), no difference was observed in anatomic distribution or prevalence of MRI signal changes between vigabatrin treated and placebo treated patients. In the postmarketing setting, MRI changes have also been reported in patients 6 years of age and younger being treated for refractory CPS.</p><p>For adults treated with SABRIL, routine MRI surveillance is unnecessary as there is no evidence that vigabatrin causes MRI changes in this population.</p><h3>5.4 Neurotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Intramyelinic Edema (IME) has been reported in postmortem examination of infants being treated for infantile spasms with vigabatrin.</p><p>Abnormal MRI signal changes characterized by increased T2 signal and restricted diffusion in a symmetric pattern involving the thalamus, basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum have also been observed in some infants treated for IS with vigabatrin. Studies of the effects of vigabatrin on MRI and evoked potentials (EP) in adult epilepsy patients have demonstrated no clear-cut abnormalities <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><p>Vacuolation, characterized by fluid accumulation and separation of the outer layers of myelin, has been observed in brain white matter tracts in adult and juvenile rats and adult mice, dogs, and possibly monkeys following administration of vigabatrin. This lesion, referred to as intramyelinic edema (IME), was seen in animals at doses within the human therapeutic range. A no-effect dose was not established in rodents or dogs. In the rat and dog, vacuolation was reversible following discontinuation of vigabatrin treatment, but, in the rat, pathologic changes consisting of swollen or degenerating axons, mineralization, and gliosis were seen in brain areas in which vacuolation had been previously observed.  Vacuolation in adult animals was correlated with alterations in MRI and changes in visual and somatosensory EP.</p><p>Administration of vigabatrin to rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of development produced vacuolar changes in the brain gray matter (including the thalamus, midbrain, deep cerebellar nuclei, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and forebrain) which are considered distinct from the IME observed in vigabatrin treated adult animals. Decreased myelination and evidence of oligodendrocyte injury were additional findings in the brains of vigabatrin-treated rats. An increase in apoptosis was seen in some brain regions following vigabatrin exposure during the early postnatal period.  Long-term neurobehavioral abnormalities (convulsions, neuromotor impairment, learning deficits) were also observed following vigabatrin treatment of young rats. Administration of vigabatrin to juvenile dogs produced vacuolar changes in the brain gray matter (including the septal nuclei, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, cerebellum, and globus pallidus). Neurobehavioral effects of vigabatrin were not assessed in the juvenile dog. These effects in young animals occurred at doses lower than those producing neurotoxicity in adult animals and were associated with plasma vigabatrin levels substantially lower than those achieved clinically in infants and children <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.4)]</span>.</p><p>In a published study, vigabatrin (200, 400 mg/kg/day) induced apoptotic neurodegeneration in the brain of young rats when administered by intraperitoneal injection on postnatal days 5-7.</p><p>Administration of vigabatrin to female rats during pregnancy and lactation at doses below those used clinically resulted in hippocampal vacuolation and convulsions in the mature offspring.</p><h3>5.5 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</h3><p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including SABRIL, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p><p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug treated patients in the trials and none in placebo treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p><p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 4 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p><p class="First">Relative Risk: Incidence of Drug Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients</p><p class="First">Risk Difference:<br/>
Additional Drug Patients with Events per 1000 Patients</p><p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.</p><p>Anyone considering prescribing SABRIL or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p><p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p><h3>5.6 Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)</h3><p class="First">As with all AEDs, SABRIL should be withdrawn gradually. However, if withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse event, rapid discontinuation can be considered. Patients and caregivers should be told not to suddenly discontinue SABRIL therapy.</p><p>In controlled clinical studies in adults with complex partial seizures, SABRIL was tapered by decreasing the daily dose 1000 mg/day on a weekly basis until discontinued.</p><p>In a controlled study in pediatric patients with complex partial seizures, SABRIL was tapered by decreasing the daily dose by one third every week for three weeks.</p><p>In a controlled clinical study in patients with infantile spasms, SABRIL was tapered by decreasing the daily dose at a rate of 25-50 mg/kg every 3-4 days.</p><h3>5.7 Anemia</h3><p class="First">In North American controlled trials in adults, 6% of patients (16/280) receiving SABRIL and 2% of patients (3/188) receiving placebo had adverse events of anemia and/or met criteria for potentially clinically important hematology changes involving hemoglobin, hematocrit, and/or RBC indices.  Across U.S. controlled trials, there were mean decreases in hemoglobin of about 3% and 0% in SABRIL and placebo-treated patients, respectively, and a mean decrease in hematocrit of about 1% in SABRIL-treated patients compared to a mean gain of about 1% in patients treated with placebo.</p><p>In controlled and open-label epilepsy trials in adults and pediatric patients, 3 SABRIL patients (0.06%, 3/4855) discontinued for anemia and 2 SABRIL patients experienced unexplained declines in hemoglobin to below 8 g/dL and/or hematocrit below 24%.</p><h3>5.8 Somnolence and Fatigue</h3><p class="First">SABRIL causes somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be advised not to drive a car or operate other complex machinery until they are familiar with the effects of SABRIL on their ability to perform such activities.</p><p>Pooled data from two SABRIL controlled trials in adults demonstrated that 24% (54/222) of SABRIL patients experienced somnolence compared to 10% (14/135) of placebo patients. In those same studies, 28% of SABRIL patients experienced fatigue compared to 15% (20/135) of placebo patients. Almost 1% of SABRIL patients discontinued from clinical trials for somnolence and almost 1% discontinued for fatigue.</p><p>Pooled data from three SABRIL controlled trials in pediatric patients demonstrated that 6% (10/165) of SABRIL patients experienced somnolence compared to 5% (5/104) of placebo patients. In those same studies, 10% (17/165) of SABRIL patients experienced fatigue compared to 7% (7/104) of placebo patients. No SABRIL patients discontinued from clinical trials due to somnolence or fatigue.</p><h3>5.9 Peripheral Neuropathy</h3><p class="First">SABRIL causes symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in adults. Pediatric clinical trials were not designed to assess symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, but observed incidence of symptoms based on pooled data from controlled pediatric studies appeared similar for pediatric patients on vigabatrin and placebo. In a pool of North American controlled and uncontrolled epilepsy studies, 4.2% (19/457) of SABRIL patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. In the subset of North American placebo-controlled epilepsy trials, 1.4% (4/280) of SABRIL treated patients and no (0/188) placebo patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Initial manifestations of peripheral neuropathy in these trials included, in some combination, symptoms of numbness or tingling in the toes or feet, signs of reduced distal lower limb vibration or position sensation, or progressive loss of reflexes, starting at the ankles. Clinical studies in the development program were not designed to investigate peripheral neuropathy systematically and did not include nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing, or skin or nerve biopsy. There is insufficient evidence to determine if development of these signs and symptoms was related to duration of SABRIL treatment, cumulative dose, or if the findings of peripheral neuropathy were completely reversible upon discontinuation of SABRIL.</p><h3>5.10 Weight Gain</h3><p class="First">SABRIL causes weight gain in adult and pediatric patients.</p><p>Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in adults found that 17% (77/443) of SABRIL patients versus 8% (22/275) of placebo patients gained ≥7% of baseline body weight. In these same trials, the mean weight change among SABRIL patients was 3.5 kg compared to 1.6 kg for placebo patients.</p><p>Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in pediatric patients with refractory complex partial seizures found that 47% (77/163) of SABRIL patients versus 19% (19/102) of placebo patients gained ≥7% of baseline body weight.</p><p>In all epilepsy trials, 0.6% (31/4855) of SABRIL patients discontinued for weight gain. The long term effects of SABRIL related weight gain are not known. Weight gain was not related to the occurrence of edema.</p><h3>5.11 Edema</h3><p class="First">SABRIL causes edema in adults.  Pediatric clinical trials were not designed to assess edema, but observed incidence of edema-based pooled data from controlled pediatric studies appeared similar for pediatric patients on vigabatrin and placebo.</p><p>Pooled data from controlled trials demonstrated increased risk among SABRIL patients compared to placebo patients for peripheral edema (SABRIL 2%, placebo 1%), and edema (SABRIL 1%, placebo 0%). In these studies, one SABRIL and no placebo patients discontinued for an edema related AE. In adults, there was no apparent association between edema and cardiovascular adverse events such as hypertension or congestive heart failure. Edema was not associated with laboratory changes suggestive of deterioration in renal or hepatic function.</p><h2>6 ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">The following serious and otherwise important adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling:</span></p><ul class="Disk">

Encourage women who are taking SABRIL during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll-free number 1-888-233-2334 or visiting the website, http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. This must be done by the patient herself.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of SABRIL in pregnant women. Limited available data from case reports and cohort studies pertaining to SABRIL use in pregnant women have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, based on animal data, SABRIL use in pregnant women may result in fetal harm.</p><p>When administered to pregnant animals, vigabatrin produced developmental toxicity, including an increase in fetal malformations and offspring neurobehavioral and neurohistopathological effects, at clinically relevant doses. In addition, developmental neurotoxicity was observed in rats treated with vigabatrin during a period of postnatal development corresponding to the third trimester of human pregnancy <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.

The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rabbits (100 mg/kg/day) is approximately 1/2 the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3 g/day on a body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) basis. In rats, oral administration of vigabatrin (50, 100, or 150 mg/kg/day) throughout organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weights and increased incidences of fetal anatomic variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development in rats (50 mg/kg/day) is approximately 1/5 the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Oral administration of vigabatrin (50, 100, 150 mg/kg/day) to rats from the latter part of pregnancy through weaning produced long-term neurohistopathological (hippocampal vacuolation) and neurobehavioral (convulsions) abnormalities in the offspring. A no-effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in rats was not established; the low-effect dose (50 mg/kg/day) is approximately 1/5 the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><p>In a published study, vigabatrin (300 or 450 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal injection to a mutant mouse strain on a single day during organogenesis (day 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12). An increase in fetal malformations (including cleft palate) was observed at both doses.</p><p>Oral administration of vigabatrin (5, 15, or 50 mg/kg/day) to young rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of development (postnatal days 4-65) produced neurobehavioral (convulsions, neuromotor impairment, learning deficits) and neurohistopathological (brain vacuolation, decreased myelination, and retinal dysplasia) abnormalities in treated animals. The early postnatal period in rats is generally thought to correspond to late pregnancy in humans in terms of brain development. The no-effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in juvenile rats (5 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma vigabatrin exposures (AUC) less than 1/30 of those measured in pediatric patients receiving an oral dose of 50 mg/kg.</p><h3>8.2 Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Vigabatrin is excreted in human milk.

The no-effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in juvenile rats (the lowest dose tested) was associated with plasma vigabatrin exposures (AUC) substantially less than those measured in pediatric patients at recommended doses. In dogs, oral administration of vigabatrin (30 or 100 mg/kg/day) during selected periods of juvenile development (postnatal days 22-112) produced neurohistopathological abnormalities (brain gray matter vacuolation). Neurobehavioral effects of vigabatrin were not assessed in the juvenile dog. A no-effect dose for neurohistopathology was not established in juvenile dogs; the lowest effect dose (30 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma vigabatrin exposures lower than those measured in pediatric patients at recommended doses <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span></p><h3>8.5 Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of vigabatrin did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger patients.</p><p>Vigabatrin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

It is not possible to predict the extent to which a CNS active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse of vigabatrin (e.g., incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behavior).</p><h3>9.3 Dependence</h3><p class="First">Following chronic administration of vigabatrin to animals, there were no apparent withdrawal signs upon drug discontinuation.  However, as with all AEDs, vigabatrin should be withdrawn gradually to minimize increased seizure frequency <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><h2>10 OVERDOSAGE</h2><h3>10.1 Signs, Symptoms, and Laboratory Findings of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">Confirmed and/or suspected vigabatrin overdoses have been reported during clinical trials and in post marketing surveillance. No vigabatrin overdoses resulted in death. When reported, the vigabatrin dose ingested ranged from 3 g to 90 g, but most were between 7.5 g and 30 g. Nearly half the cases involved multiple drug ingestions including carbamazepine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, lamotrigine, valproic acid, acetaminophen, and/or chlorpheniramine.</p><p>Coma, unconsciousness, and/or drowsiness were described in the majority of cases of vigabatrin overdose. Other less commonly reported symptoms included vertigo, psychosis, apnea or respiratory depression, bradycardia, agitation, irritability, confusion, headache, hypotension, abnormal behavior, increased seizure activity, status epilepticus, and speech disorder. These symptoms resolved with supportive care.</p><h3>10.2 Management of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">There is no specific antidote for SABRIL overdose. Standard measures to remove unabsorbed drug should be used, including elimination by emesis or gastric lavage. Supportive measures should be employed, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.</p><p>In an <span class="Italics">in</span> <span class="Italics">vitro</span> study, activated charcoal did not significantly adsorb vigabatrin.</p><p>The effectiveness of hemodialysis in the treatment of SABRIL overdose is unknown. In isolated case reports in renal failure patients receiving therapeutic doses of vigabatrin, hemodialysis reduced vigabatrin plasma concentrations by 40% to 60%.</p><h2>11 DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">SABRIL (vigabatrin) is an oral antiepileptic drug and is available as white film-coated 500 mg tablets and as a white to off-white granular powder for oral solution in packets of 500 mg.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">The chemical name of vigabatrin, a racemate consisting of two enantiomers, is (±) 4-amino-5-hexenoic acid. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">6</span>H<span class="Sub">11</span>NO<span class="Sub">2</span> and the molecular weight is 129.16. It has the following structural formula:</span></p><p>Vigabatrin is a white to off-white powder which is freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in methyl alcohol, very slightly soluble in ethyl alcohol and chloroform, and insoluble in toluene and hexane. The pH of a 1% aqueous solution is about 6.9. The n-octanol/water partition coefficient of vigabatrin is about 0.011 (log <span class="Italics">P=-</span>1.96) at physiologic pH. Vigabatrin melts with decomposition in a 3-degree range within the temperature interval of 171ºC to 176ºC. The dissociation constants (pK<span class="Sub">a</span>) of vigabatrin are 4 and 9.7 at room temperature (25ºC).</p><p>Each SABRIL tablet contains 500 mg of vigabatrin. The inactive ingredients are hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycols, povidone, sodium starch glycolate, and titanium dioxide.</p><p>SABRIL powder for oral solution is available as white to off-white granular powder for oral administration. Each packet contains 500 mg of vigabatrin. The inactive ingredient is povidone.</p><h2>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The precise mechanism of vigabatrin’s anti-seizure effect is unknown, but it is believed to be the result of its action as an irreversible inhibitor of γ-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T), the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. This action results in increased levels of GABA in the central nervous system.</p><p>No direct correlation between plasma concentration and efficacy has been established. The duration of drug effect is presumed to be dependent on the rate of enzyme re-synthesis rather than on the rate of elimination of the drug from the systemic circulation.</p><h3>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on Electrocardiogram</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><br/></span></span> There is no indication of a QT/QTc prolonging effect of SABRIL in single doses up to 6.0 g. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 58 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of SABRIL (3 g and 6 g) and placebo. Peak concentrations for 6.0 g SABRIL were approximately 2-fold higher than the peak concentrations following the 3.0 g single oral dose.</p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Vigabatrin displayed linear pharmacokinetics after administration of single doses ranging from 0.5 g to 4 g, and after administration of repeated doses of 0.5 g and 2.0 g twice daily. Bioequivalence has been established between the oral solution and tablet formulations. The following PK information (T<span class="Sub">max</span>, half-life, and clearance) of vigabatrin was obtained from stand-alone PK studies and population PK analyses. </p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><br/></span></span> Following oral administration, vigabatrin is essentially completely absorbed. The time to maximum concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) is approximately 1 hour for children and adolescents (3 years to 16 years of age) and adults, and approximately 2.5 hours for infants (5 months to 2 years of age). There was little accumulation with multiple dosing in adult and pediatric patients.

A total of 357 adults (age 18 to 60 years) with complex partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization were enrolled (Studies 1 and 2). Patients were required to be on an adequate and stable dose of an anticonvulsant, and have a history of failure on an adequate regimen of carbamazepine or phenytoin. Patients had a history of about 8 seizures per month (median) for about 20 years (median) prior to entrance into the study. These studies were not capable by design of demonstrating direct superiority of SABRIL over any other anticonvulsant added to a regimen to which the patient had not adequately responded. Further, in these studies patients had previously been treated with a limited range of anticonvulsants.</p><p>The primary measure of efficacy was the patient’s reduction in mean monthly frequency of complex partial seizures plus partial seizures secondarily generalized at end of study compared to baseline.</p><p><span class="Italics">Study 1</span></p><p>Study 1 (N=174) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study consisting of an 8-week baseline period followed by an 18-week treatment period.

During the first 6 weeks following randomization, the dose was titrated upward beginning with 1 g/day and increasing by 0.5 g/day on days 1 and 5 of each subsequent week in the 3 g/day and 6 g/day groups, until the assigned dose was reached.</p><p>Results for the primary measure of effectiveness, reduction in monthly frequency of complex partial seizures, are shown in Table 8.

The proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction in complex partial seizure frequency was consistently higher for the SABRIL 3 and 6 g/day groups compared to the placebo group. For example, 51% of patients randomized to SABRIL 3 g/day and 53% of patients randomized to SABRIL 6 g/day experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, compared to 9% of patients randomized to placebo.

Both studies were similar in terms of disease characteristics and prior treatments of patients and all enrolled infants had a confirmed diagnosis of infantile spasms.</p><p><span class="Bold">Study 1</span></p><p>Study 1 (N=221) was a multicenter, randomized, low-dose high-dose, parallel-group, partially-blind (caregivers knew the actual dose but not whether their child was classified as low or high dose; EEG reader was blinded but investigators were not blinded) study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vigabatrin in patients &lt;2 years of age with new-onset infantile spasms. Patients with both symptomatic and cryptogenic etiologies were studied. The study was comprised of two phases. The first phase was a 14 to 21 day partially-blind phase in which patients were randomized to receive either low-dose (18-36 mg/kg/day) or high-dose (100-148 mg/kg/day) vigabatrin. Study drug was titrated over 7 days, followed by a constant dose for 7 days. If the patient became spasm-free on or before day 14, another 7 days of constant dose was administered. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients who were spasm-free for 7 consecutive days beginning within the first 14 days of vigabatrin therapy. Patients considered spasm-free were defined as those patients who remained free of spasms (evaluated according to caregiver response to direct questioning regarding spasm frequency) and who had no indication of spasms or hypsarrhythmia during 8 hours of CCTV EEG recording (including at least one sleep-wake-sleep cycle) performed within 3 days of the seventh day of spasm freedom and interpreted by a blinded EEG reader. Seventeen patients in the high-dose group achieved spasm freedom compared with 8 patients in the low dose group. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.0375). Primary efficacy results are shown in Table 10.</p><p class="First">Patients who Achieved Spasm Freedom</p><p class="First">8 (7.0)</p><p class="First">17 (15.9)</p><p class="First">p=0.0375<br/>

The primary efficacy endpoint in this study was the average percent change in daily spasm frequency, assessed during a pre-defined and consistent 2-hour window of evaluation, comparing baseline to the final 2 days of the 5-day double-blind treatment phase. No statistically significant differences were observed in the average frequency of spasms using the 2-hour evaluation window. However, a post-hoc alternative efficacy analysis, using a 24-hour clinical evaluation window found a statistically significant difference in the overall percentage of reductions in spasms between the vigabatrin group (68.9%) and the placebo group (17.0%) (p=0.030).</p><p>Duration of therapy for infantile spasms was evaluated in a post hoc analysis of a Canadian Pediatric Epilepsy Network (CPEN) study of developmental outcomes in infantile spasms patients.  The 38/68 infants in the study who had responded to vigabatrin therapy (complete cessation of spasms and hypsarrhythmia) continued vigabatrin therapy for a total duration of 6 months therapy. The 38 infants who responded were then followed for an additional 18 months after discontinuation of vigabatrin to determine their clinical outcome. A post hoc analysis indicated no observed recurrence of infantile spasms in any of these 38 infants. </p><h2>16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING</h2><h3>16.1 How Supplied</h3><p class="First">SABRIL 500 mg tablets are white, film-coated, oval, biconvex, scored on one side, and debossed with OV 111 on the other.

<li>It is not possible for your healthcare provider to know when vision loss will happen. It could happen soon after starting SABRIL or any time during treatment. It may even happen after treatment has stopped.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disk">
<li>Because SABRIL might cause permanent vision loss, it is available to healthcare providers and patients only under a special program called the Vigabatrin Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. SABRIL can only be prescribed to people who are enrolled in this program. As part of the Vigabatrin REMS Program, it is recommended that your healthcare provider test your (or your child’s) vision from time to time (periodically) while you (or your child) are being treated with SABRIL, and even after you (or your child) stop treatment. Your healthcare provider will explain the details of the Vigabatrin REMS Program to you. For more information, go to www.vigabatrinREMS.com or call 1-866-244-8175.</li>
