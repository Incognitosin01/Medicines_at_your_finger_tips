Vahl<br/><b>Common Name(s):</b> Forsythia, Golden bells, Lian qiao, Weeping forsythia</p><h2>Clinical Overview</h2><h3>Use</h3><p>Clinical trials are lacking to support a place in therapy for forsythia. Research interest focuses on chemotherapeutic applications.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>There are no recent clinical studies of forsythia to provide a basis for dosage recommendations.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Contraindications have not yet been identified.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Lactation</h3><p>Documented adverse effects. Uterine stimulant, emmenagogue. Avoid use.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>None well documented.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>Forsythia is contraindicated in pregnancy.</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>Information is limited.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Oleaceae (olives)</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>F. suspensa is an attractive deciduous shrub native to China. It is often grown ornamentally in the United States for its bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring. There are numerous horticultural varieties that are vegetatively propagated. The Chinese drug is obtained in the fall from the ripe fruits of the cultivated plant. The related species F. viridissima and F. koreana also are used medicinally.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Forsythia fruits are widely used in Chinese traditional medicine for antipyretic and anti-inflammatory activity in the treatment of bacterial infections and upper respiratory ailments. They are commonly combined with honeysuckle flower (Lonicera) and other ingredients. Forsythia fruits are also reputedly used as a diuretic and as a cardiovascular tonic.</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Lignans, such as phylligenin and pinoresinol, and their glucosides are major constituents of F. suspensa fruits, while the other species contain related compounds.1 Caffeic acid glycosides with variation in the number of sugars include forsythiaside2 suspensaside3 and a number of forsythosides.4 The reduced cyclohexylethane derivatives rengyol, rengyoxide, and rengyolone5 and their glycosides (rengyosides A-C6 and forsythensides A and B7) have been reported. The distribution of various phenolics among 7 different species of forsythia in leaves and fruits has been studied.8, 9 Rutin is the major flavonoid of all 7 forsythia species.9 Caffeic ester glycosides from related genera of the Oleaceae have been compared.10 Several triterpenes have been isolated from the fruits as well.11 An HPLC assay for major forsythia phenolics has been published.12 The essential oil composition of the fruits has been studied.13</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Antimicrobial activity</h3><p>Antimicrobial effects, including antiviral activity, have been reported on screening and in vitro studies.3, 4, 14, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of forsythia as an antimicrobial agent.</p><h3>Cancer</h3><p>Extracts of forsythia have been studied in human tumor cell lines and rodent studies.30, 31, 32</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of forsythia in cancer.</p><h3>Other uses</h3><p>Antioxidant activity against LDL oxidation has been demonstrated in vitro.20, 33</p><p>Anti-inflammatory effects were reported on in older in vitro studies.11, 15, 16, 17, 18</p><p>The flavonoid rutin was found to be the active anti-emetic constituent of forsythia fruits using an experimental chicken model of emesis.22</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>There are no recent clinical studies of forsythia to provide a basis for dosage recommendations.</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Documented adverse effects. Uterine stimulant, emmenagogue. Avoid use.23</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Use during pregnancy is strictly contraindicated because of its emmenagogue/uterine stimulant properties.</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Information is limited. F. suspensa extracts were not mutagenic in Ames tests; however, the incidence of chromosomal aberrations and micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in bone marrow of treated mice were somewhat elevated.24</p><h2>Index Terms</h2><ul><li><i>Forsythia koreana</i></li><li><i>Forsythia viridissima</i></li></ul><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
