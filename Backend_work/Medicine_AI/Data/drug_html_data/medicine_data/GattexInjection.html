</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">For Injection: 5 mg teduglutide as a white lyophilized powder for reconstitution in a single-dose vial supplied with 0.5 mL Sterile Water for Injection in a single-dose prefilled syringe.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Acceleration of Neoplastic Growth</h3><p class="First">Based on the pharmacologic activity and findings in animals, GATTEX has the potential to cause hyperplastic changes including neoplasia <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>. In patients at increased risk for malignancy, the clinical decision to use GATTEX should be considered only if the benefits outweigh the risks. In patients who develop active gastrointestinal malignancy (GI tract, hepatobiliary, pancreatic) while on GATTEX, discontinue GATTEX treatment. In patients who develop active non-gastrointestinal malignancy while on GATTEX, the clinical decision to continue GATTEX should be made based on benefit-risk considerations.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Colorectal Polyps</span></p><p>Colorectal polyps were identified during the clinical studies <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. In adults, within 6 months prior to starting treatment with GATTEX, perform colonoscopy of the entire colon with removal of polyps. A follow-up colonoscopy (or alternate imaging) is recommended at the end of 1 year of GATTEX. Perform subsequent colonoscopies every 5 years or more often as needed. If a polyp is found, adherence to current polyp follow-up guidelines is recommended. If colorectal cancer is diagnosed, discontinue GATTEX therapy.</p><p>In children and adolescents, perform fecal occult blood testing prior to initiating treatment with GATTEX. Colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy is required if there is unexplained blood in the stool. Perform subsequent fecal occult blood testing annually in children and adolescents while they are receiving GATTEX. Colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy is recommended for all children and adolescents after 1 year of treatment, every 5 years thereafter while on continuous treatment with GATTEX, and if they have new or unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Small Bowel Neoplasia</span></p><p>Based on tumor findings in the rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies, monitor patients clinically for small bowel neoplasia <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>. If a benign neoplasm is found, it should be removed. In case of small bowel cancer, discontinue GATTEX therapy.</p><h3>Intestinal Obstruction</h3><p class="First">Intestinal obstruction has been reported in clinical studies <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span> and postmarketing. In patients who develop intestinal or stomal obstruction, temporarily discontinue GATTEX while the patient is clinically managed. GATTEX may be restarted when the obstructive presentation resolves, if clinically indicated.</p><h3>Biliary and Pancreatic Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gallbladder and Biliary Tract Disease</span></p><p>Cholecystitis, cholangitis, and cholelithiasis have been reported in clinical studies <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span> and postmarketing. For identification of the onset or worsening of gallbladder/biliary disease, obtain laboratory assessment of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase within 6 months prior to starting GATTEX, and at least every 6 months while on GATTEX; or more frequently if needed. If clinically meaningful changes are seen, further evaluation including imaging of the gallbladder and/or biliary tract is recommended; and reassess the need for continued GATTEX treatment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pancreatic Disease</span></p><p>Pancreatitis has been reported in clinical studies <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. For identification of onset or worsening of pancreatic disease, obtain laboratory assessments of lipase and amylase within 6 months prior to starting GATTEX, and at least every 6 months while on GATTEX; or more frequently if needed. If clinically meaningful changes are seen, further evaluation such as imaging of the pancreas is recommended; and reassess the need for continued GATTEX treatment.</p><h3>Fluid Imbalance and Fluid Overload</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Fluid Overload</span></p><p>Fluid overload and congestive heart failure have been observed in clinical studies, which were deemed to be related to enhanced fluid absorption associated with GATTEX <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. If fluid overload occurs, adjust parenteral support and reassess GATTEX treatment, especially in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. If significant cardiac deterioration develops while on GATTEX, reassess the need for continued GATTEX treatment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance</span></p><p>Discontinuation of treatment with GATTEX may also result in fluid and electrolyte imbalance. Monitor fluid and electrolyte status in patients who discontinue treatment with GATTEX <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].</span></p><h3>Increased Absorption of Concomitant Oral Medication</h3><p class="First">In the adult placebo-controlled studies, an analysis of episodes of cognition and attention disturbances was performed for patients on benzodiazepines. One patient receiving prazepam concomitantly with GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg once daily experienced a dramatic deterioration in mental status progressing to coma during the first week of GATTEX therapy. The patient was admitted to the ICU and the prazepam blood concentration was &gt;300 mcg/L. GATTEX and prazepam were discontinued, and coma resolved 5 days later.</p><p>Monitor patients receiving concomitant oral drugs requiring titration or with a narrow therapeutic index, for adverse reactions due to potential increased absorption of the concomitant drug. The concomitant drug may require a reduction in dosage <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The rates of adverse reactions in 136 adult patients with SBS participating in two randomized, placebo-controlled, 24-week, double-blind clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 3) are summarized in Table 1. Only those reactions with a rate of at least 5% in the GATTEX group, and greater than placebo group, are summarized in Table 1.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions in the Subset of Patients with a Stoma</span></p><p>Among the 53 patients with a stoma in the placebo-controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 3), the percentage of patients with gastrointestinal stoma complication was 42% (13/31) for patients receiving GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day and 14% (3/22) for patients receiving placebo.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients 1 Year to Less Than 17 Years of Age</span></p><p>In two clinical studies of 24-week and 12-week duration, 41 pediatric patients aged 1 year to less than 17 years were treated with GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>. Overall, the safety profile of GATTEX was similar to that in adults. In the long-term extension studies with mean exposure of 41 weeks, no new safety signals were identified.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Less Common Adverse Reactions</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions of Special Interest</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Malignancy</span></p><p>Three patients were diagnosed with malignancy in the SBS clinical studies in adults, all of whom were male and had received GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day in Study 2. One patient had a history of abdominal radiation for Hodgkin's disease two decades prior to receiving GATTEX and prior liver lesion on CT scan, and was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unconfirmed origin after 11 months of exposure to GATTEX. Two patients had extensive smoking histories and were diagnosed with lung cancers (squamous and non-small cell) after 12 months and 3 months of GATTEX exposure, respectively <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Intestinal Polyps</span></p><p>In the adult clinical studies, 14 patients with SBS were diagnosed with polyps of the GI tract after initiation of study treatment. In the SBS placebo-controlled studies, 1/59 (2%) of patients on placebo and 1/109 (1%) of patients on GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day were diagnosed with intestinal polyps (inflammatory stomal and hyperplastic sigmoidal after 3 and 5 months, respectively). The remaining 12 polyp cases occurred in the extension studies â 2 colorectal villous adenomas (onset at 6 and 7 months in GATTEX 0.1 mg/kg/day (twice the recommended dose) and 0.05 mg/kg/day dose groups, respectively), 2 hyperplastic polyps (onset 6 months in GATTEX 0.1 mg/kg/day dose group and 24 months in GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day dose group), 4 colorectal tubular adenomas (onset between 24 and 29 months in GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day dose group), 1 serrated adenoma (onset at 24 months in GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day dose group), 1 colorectal polyp biopsy not done (onset at 24 months in GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day dose group), 1 rectal inflammatory polyp (onset at 10 months in the GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day dose group, and 1 small duodenal polyp (onset at 3 months in GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day dose group) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>In the pediatric clinical studies (up to 69 weeks of exposure), there was one case of cecal polyp that was not biopsied and was not seen on repeat colonoscopy.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Gastrointestinal Obstruction</span></p><p>Overall, in the adult clinical studies, 12 patients with SBS experienced one or more episodes of intestinal obstruction/stenosis: 6 in SBS placebo-controlled studies and 6 in the extension studies. The 6 patients in the placebo-controlled studies were all on GATTEX: 3/77 (4%) on GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day and 3/32 (9%) on GATTEX 0.1 mg/kg/day (twice the recommended dose). No cases of intestinal obstruction occurred in the placebo group. Onset ranged from 1 day to 6 months. In the adult extension studies, 6 additional patients (all on GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day) were diagnosed with intestinal obstruction/stenosis with onsets ranging from 6 days to 19 months. Two of the 6 patients from the placebo-controlled studies experienced recurrence of obstruction in the extension studies. Of all 8 patients with an episode of intestinal obstruction/stenosis in these extension studies, 2 patients required endoscopic dilation and 1 required surgical intervention) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p>In the pediatric clinical studies (up to 69 weeks of exposure), there was 1 serious adverse reaction of obstruction. Teduglutide was temporarily withheld, obstruction resolved without additional intervention, and there was no recurrence once teduglutide was restarted.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Gallbladder, Biliary and Pancreatic Disease</span></p><p>For gallbladder and biliary disease in the adult placebo-controlled studies, 3 patients with SBS were diagnosed with cholecystitis, all of whom had a prior history of gallbladder disease and were in the GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day dose group. No cases were reported in the placebo group. One of these 3 cases had gallbladder perforation and underwent cholecystectomy the next day. The remaining 2 cases underwent elective cholecystectomy at a later date. In the adult extension studies, 4 patients had an episode of acute cholecystitis; 3 patients had new-onset cholelithiasis; and 1 patient experienced cholestasis secondary to an obstructed biliary stent. For pancreatic disease in the adult placebo-controlled studies, 1 patient (GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day dose group) had a pancreatic pseudocyst diagnosed after 4 months of GATTEX. In the adult extension studies, 1 patient was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis; and 1 patient was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Fluid Overload</span></p><p>In the adult placebo-controlled studies, peripheral edema was reported in 2/59 (3%) of patients on placebo and 8/77 (10%) patients on GATTEX; fluid overload was reported in 1/77 (1%) patient in the GATTEX group; no cases of fluid overload were seen in the placebo arm. There were 2 cases of congestive heart failure (CHF, 3%) in the GATTEX arm, 1 of which was reported as a serious adverse event and the other as non-serious. The serious case had onset at 6 months and was possibly associated with previously undiagnosed hypothyroidism and/or cardiac dysfunction <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Other Less Common Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Reported in less than 5% of patients treated with GATTEX:</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal disorders:</span> Colonic stenosis, Pancreatic duct stenosis, Small intestinal stenosis</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:</span> Dyspnea</p><h3>Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">As with all peptides, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to teduglutide in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>Based on integrated data from two studies in adults with SBS (a 6-month randomized placebo-controlled study, followed by a 24-month open-label study), the development of anti-teduglutide antibodies in patients who received subcutaneous administration of 0.05 mg/kg GATTEX once daily was 3% (2/60) at Month 3, 17% (13/77) at Month 6, 24% (16/67) at Month 12, 33% (11/33) at Month 24, and 48% (14/29) at Month 30. Anti-teduglutide antibodies were cross-reactive to native glucagon-like peptide (GLP-2) in 5 of the 6 patients (83%) who had anti-teduglutide antibodies and were tested for cross-reactivity. In the same two studies, a total of 36 patients were tested for neutralizing antibodies: one patient developed borderline positive neutralizing antibody responses at month 24 of the extension study. The antibody formation has not been associated with clinically relevant safety findings, reduced efficacy or changed pharmacokinetics of GATTEX.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients 1 Year to Less than 17 Years of Age</span></p><p>In pediatric patients who received subcutaneous administration of 0.05 mg/kg GATTEX once daily for 24 weeks, the rate of anti-teduglutide antibody formation at Month 6 was 19% (5/26) and was similar to the rate of antibody formation in adult patients (17%). Of the 5 pediatric patients who had developed antibodies to teduglutide at Month 6, 2 patients had neutralizing antibodies. However, with the longer duration of treatment, the rate of anti-teduglutide formation at Month 12 was higher in pediatric patients with 54% (14/26), compared to that of adults (24%). Of the 14 pediatric patients who had developed antibodies to teduglutide at Month 12, 1 patient had neutralizing antibodies.</p><p>Among the small number of pediatric patients who developed anti-teduglutide antibodies, no association with adverse events or lack of efficacy was observed.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Potential for Increased Absorption of Oral Medications</h3><p class="First">Based upon the pharmacodynamic effect of GATTEX, there is a potential for increased absorption of concomitant oral medications. Altered mental status has been observed in patients taking GATTEX and benzodiazepines in the adult clinical studies <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><p>Monitor patients on concomitant oral drugs requiring titration or with a narrow therapeutic index for adverse reactions related to the concomitant drug while on GATTEX. The concomitant drug may require a reduction in dosage.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available data from case reports with GATTEX use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Pregnant women with short bowel syndrome are at risk for malnutrition, which is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</span>. In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed with the subcutaneous administration of teduglutide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at exposures up to 686 and 657 times, respectively, the clinical exposure at the recommended human dose (based on AUC) (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>).</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk</span></p><p>Pregnant women with short bowel syndrome are at risk for malnutrition.

These studies did not reveal any evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to teduglutide. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats (gestation day 7 to lactation day 20), teduglutide did not show any significant adverse effects on pre- and postnatal development at doses up to 25 mg/kg twice daily (50 mg/kg/day) (about 343 times the clinical exposure (AUC) at the recommended daily human dose of 0.05 mg/kg).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of GATTEX in human milk, the effects of GATTEX on the breastfed infant, or the effects of GATTEX on milk production. Teduglutide is present in the milk of lactating rats (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>). Systemic exposure of teduglutide to a breastfed infant is expected to be low. However, because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, including tumorigenicity <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with GATTEX.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>In a milk excretion study in the rat, a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of teduglutide (81 times the recommended daily human dose of 0.05 mg/kg based on body surface area) was administered to lactating female rats at Day 12 postpartum.

In the event of overdose, the patient should be carefully monitored by the medical professional.</p><h2>Gattex Injection Description</h2><p class="First">The active ingredient in GATTEX (teduglutide) for injection is teduglutide, which is a 33 amino acid glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) analog manufactured using a strain of <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span> modified by recombinant DNA technology. The chemical composition of teduglutide is L-histidyl-L-glycyl-L-aspartyl-L-glycyl-L-seryl-L-phenylalanyl-L-seryl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamyl-L-methionyl-L-asparaginyl-L-threonyl-L-isoleucyl-L-leucyl-L-aspartyl-L-asparaginyl-L-leucyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-arginyl-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-isoleucyl-L-asparaginyl-L-tryptophanyl-L-leucyl-L-isoleucyl-L-glutaminyl-L-threonyl-L-lysyl-L-isoleucyl-L-threonyl-L-aspartic acid. The structural formula is:</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Figure 1: Structural formula of teduglutide</p><p>Teduglutide has a molecular weight of 3752 Daltons. Teduglutide drug substance is a clear, colorless to light-strawâcolored liquid.</p><p>Each single-dose vial of GATTEX contains 5 mg of teduglutide as a white lyophilized powder for reconstitution and administration by subcutaneous injection. In addition to the active pharmaceutical ingredient (teduglutide), each vial of GATTEX contains 3.434 mg dibasic sodium phosphate heptahydrate, 3.88 mg L-histidine, 15 mg mannitol, and 0.644 mg monobasic sodium phosphate monohydrate as excipients. No preservatives are present.</p><p>At the time of administration, the lyophilized powder is reconstituted with 0.5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, which is provided in a single-dose prefilled syringe. A 10 mg/mL sterile solution is obtained after reconstitution. Up to 0.38 mL of the reconstituted solution which contains 3.8 mg of teduglutide can be withdrawn for subcutaneous injection upon reconstitution.</p><h2>Gattex Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Teduglutide is an analog of naturally occurring human glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), a peptide secreted by L-cells of the distal intestine. GLP-2 is known to increase intestinal and portal blood flow and inhibit gastric acid secretion. Teduglutide binds to the glucagon-like peptide-2 receptors located in intestinal subpopulations of enteroendocrine cells, subepithelial myofibroblasts and enteric neurons of the submucosal and myenteric plexus. Activation of these receptors results in the local release of multiple mediators including insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, nitric oxide and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF).</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Intestinal Fluid Absorption</span></p><p>The ability of GATTEX to improve intestinal absorption was studied in 17 adult subjects with Short Bowel Syndrome (N=2-3 per dose group) using daily doses of 0.03, 0.1, 0.15 mg/kg (doses ranging from 0.6 to 3 times the recommended dose) in a 21-day, open-label, multi-center, dose-ranging study. All subcutaneous (abdomen) doses studied, except 0.03 mg/kg once daily, resulted in enhanced gastrointestinal fluid (wet weight) absorption of approximately 750 to 1000 mL/day, and increased villus height and crypt depth of the intestinal mucosa.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>At a dose 5 times the recommended dose, GATTEX did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>In healthy subjects, GATTEX administered subcutaneously had an absolute bioavailability of 88% and reached maximum plasma teduglutide concentrations at 3 to 5 hours after administration. Following a 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneous dose in SBS subjects, the median peak teduglutide concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 36 ng/mL and the median area under the curve at steady state (AUC<span class="Sub">tau</span>) was 0.15 Âµgâhr/mL. No accumulation of teduglutide was observed following repeated subcutaneous administrations.</p><p>The C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of teduglutide was dose proportional over the dose range of 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg (up to 8 times the recommended dose of GATTEX).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>In healthy subjects, teduglutide has a volume of distribution (103 mL/kg) similar to blood volume.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>The metabolic pathway of teduglutide was not investigated in humans. However, teduglutide is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways, similar to the catabolism of endogenous GLP-2.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>In healthy subjects, teduglutide plasma clearance was approximately 123 mL/hr/kg which is similar to the GFR suggesting that teduglutide is primarily cleared by the kidney. Teduglutide has a mean terminal half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of approximately 2 hours in healthy subjects and 1.3 hours in SBS subjects.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Use in Specific Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Geriatric Patients</span></p><p>No differences were observed between healthy subjects younger than 65 years and those older than 65 years.

Teduglutide exposure increased by a factor of 1.6, 1.4, and 2.1 (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and 1.5, 1.7, and 2.6 (AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span>) in subjects with moderate, severe renal impairment and ESRD, respectively, compared to healthy subjects <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Patients with Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) had an approximately 10 to 15% lower teduglutide C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC compared to healthy matched control subjects after a single subcutaneous dose of 20 mg GATTEX. This reduction in teduglutide exposure is not thought to be clinically meaningful. GATTEX was not studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p>Clinical interaction studies were not performed.

In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Wistar Han rats at subcutaneous doses of 3, 10, and 35 mg/kg/day (about 15, 41, and 199 times the exposures [AUC] achieved at the recommended daily human dose of 0.05 mg/kg, respectively), teduglutide caused statistically significant increases in the incidences of adenomas in the bile duct and jejunum of male rats. In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Crl:CD1(ICR) mice at subcutaneous doses of 1, 3.5, and 12.5 mg/kg/day (about 32, 66, and 244 times the exposures [AUC] achieved at the recommended daily human dose of 0.05 mg/kg, respectively), teduglutide caused a significant increase in papillary adenomas in the gall bladder; it also caused adenocarcinomas in the jejunum in male mice at the high dose of 12.5 mg/kg/day.</p><p>Teduglutide was negative in the Ames test, chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay.</p><p>Teduglutide at subcutaneous doses up to 25 mg/kg twice daily (50 mg/kg/day or at least 202 times the clinical exposure (AUC) at the recommended daily human dose of 0.05 mg/kg) was found to have no adverse effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Treatment of SBS in Adults</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study 1 (Placebo-controlled) and Study 2 (Open-label Extension of Study 1)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Study 1 (CL0600-020, NCT00798967)</span></p><p>The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of GATTEX was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-national, multi-center clinical study (Study 1) in adults with SBS who were dependent on parenteral nutrition/intravenous (PN/I.V.) support for at least 12 months and required PN at least 3 times per week. For 8 weeks (or less) prior to randomization, investigators optimized the PN/I.V. volume of all patients. Optimization was followed by a 4-week to 8-week period of fluid stabilization. Patients then were randomized (1:1) to placebo (n=43) or GATTEX 0.05 mg/kg/day (n=43). Study treatment was administered subcutaneously once daily for 24 weeks. PN/I.V. volume adjustments (up to 30% decrease) and clinical assessments were made at 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, and 24 weeks.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was based on a clinical response, defined as a patient achieving at least 20% reduction in weekly PN/I.V. volume from Baseline (immediately before randomization) to both Weeks 20 and 24.</p><p>The mean age of patients was 50 years.
