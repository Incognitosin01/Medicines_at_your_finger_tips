</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in pediatric and young adult patients in short-term studies. Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Sertraline Oral Concentrate</h2><p class="First">Sertraline hydrochloride oral solution is indicated for the treatment of the following <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14)]</span>:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Major depressive disorder (MDD)</li>
<li>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</li>
<li>Panic disorder (PD)</li>
<li>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</li>
<li>Social anxiety disorder (SAD)</li>
<li>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)</li>
</ul><h2>Sertraline Oral Concentrate Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage in Patients with MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, and SAD</h3><p class="First">The recommended initial dosage and maximum sertraline hydrochloride oral solution dosage in patients with MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, and SAD are displayed in Table 1 below. A dosage of 25 mg or 50 mg per day is the initial therapeutic dosage.</p><p>For adults and pediatric patients, subsequent dosages may be increased in case of an inadequate response in 25 to 50 mg per day increments once a week, depending on tolerability, up to a maximum of 200 mg per day. Given the 24-hour elimination half-life of sertraline hydrochloride oral solution, the recommended interval between dose changes is one week.</p><h3>Dosage in Patients with PMDD</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting sertraline hydrochloride oral solution dosage in adult women with PMDD is 50 mg per day. Sertraline hydrochloride oral solution may be administered either continuously (every day throughout the menstrual cycle) or intermittently (only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, i.e., starting the daily dosage 14 days prior to the anticipated onset of menstruation and continuing through the onset of menses). Intermittent dosing would be repeated with each new cycle.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>When dosing <span class="Bold">continuously,</span> patients not responding to a 50 mg dosage may benefit from dosage increases at 50 mg increments per menstrual cycle up to 150 mg per day.</li>
<li>When dosing <span class="Bold">intermittently,</span> patients not responding to a 50 mg dosage may benefit from increasing the dosage up to a maximum of 100 mg per day during the next menstrual cycle (and subsequent cycles) as follows: 50 mg per day during the first 3 days of dosing followed by 100 mg per day during the remaining days in the dosing cycle.</li>
</ul><h3>Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Sertraline Hydrochloride Oral Solution</h3><p class="First">Prior to initiating treatment with sertraline hydrochloride oral solution or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span></p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Both the recommended starting dosage and therapeutic range in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh scores 5 or 6) are half the recommended daily dosage <span class="Italics">[See Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].</span> The use of sertraline hydrochloride oral solution in patients with moderate (Child Pugh scores 7 to 9) or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh scores 10 to 15) is not recommended <span class="Italics">[See Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor Antidepressant</h3><p class="First">At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and initiation of sertraline hydrochloride oral solution. In addition, at least 14 days must elapse after stopping sertraline hydrochloride oral solution before starting an MAOI antidepressant <span class="Italics">[See Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><h3>Discontinuation of Treatment with Sertraline Hydrochloride Oral Solution</h3><p class="First">Adverse reactions may occur upon discontinuation of sertraline hydrochloride oral solution <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].</span> Gradually reduce the dosage rather than stopping sertraline hydrochloride oral solution abruptly whenever possible.</p><h3>Preparation of Sertraline Hydrochloride Oral Solution</h3><p class="First">Sertraline hydrochloride oral solution must be diluted before use.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Use the supplied calibrated dispensing syringe to measure the amount of sertraline hydrochloride oral solution needed</li>
<li>Note: The supplied calibrated dispensing syringe has 25 mg and 50 mg graduation marks only</li>
<li>Mix with 4 ounces (1/2 cup) of water, ginger ale, lemon/lime soda, lemonade or orange juice ONLY. After mixing, a slight haze may appear, which is normal.</li>
</ul><p>Instruct patients or caregivers to immediately take the dose after mixing.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Sertraline Hydrochloride Oral Solution USP is a clear, colorless peppermint flavored liquid containing sertraline hydrochloride equivalent to 20 mg of sertraline per mL and 12% alcohol. It is supplied as a 60 mL amber colored round PET bottle with an accompanying calibrated dispensing syringe that has 25 mg and 50 mg graduation marks.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Sertraline hydrochloride oral solution is contraindicated in patients:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs, (including the MAOIs linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</li>
<li>Taking pimozide <span class="Italics">[See Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</li>
<li>With known hypersensitivity to sertraline (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) <span class="Italics">[See Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].</span></li>
</ul><p>In addition to the contraindications for all sertraline hydrochloride oral solution formulations listed above, sertraline hydrochloride oral solution is contraindicated in patients:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Taking disulfiram. Sertraline hydrochloride oral solution contains alcohol, and concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride oral solution and disulfiram may result in a disulfiram-alcohol reaction.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients</h3><p class="First">In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and over 4,400 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adult patients was greater in antidepressant-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 2.</p><p>No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were suicides in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about antidepressant drug effect on suicide.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Risk Differences of the Number of Cases of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Patients</span></p><p>It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adult patients extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression.</p><p>Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing sertraline hydrochloride, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and SSRIs, including sertraline hydrochloride, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs <span class="Italics">[See Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span> Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone.</p><p>Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).</p><p>The concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate sertraline hydrochloride in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking sertraline hydrochloride, discontinue sertraline hydrochloride before initiating treatment with the MAOI <span class="Italics">[See Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><p>Monitor all patients taking sertraline hydrochloride for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with sertraline hydrochloride and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Bleeding</h3><p class="First">Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including sertraline hydrochloride, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.</p><p>Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio.</p><h3>Activation of Mania or Hypomania</h3><p class="First">In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with sertraline hydrochloride or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials, patients with bipolar disorder were generally excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.4% of patients treated with sertraline hydrochloride. Prior to initiating treatment with sertraline hydrochloride, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.</p><h3>Discontinuation Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible <span class="Italics">[See Dosage and Administration (2.6)].</span></p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">Sertraline hydrochloride has not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with a history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. Sertraline hydrochloride should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder.</p><h3>Angle-Closure Glaucoma</h3><p class="First">The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including sertraline hydrochloride may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including sertraline hydrochloride, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.</p><h3>Hyponatremia</h3><p class="First">Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including sertraline hydrochloride. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).</p><p>In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue sertraline hydrochloride and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs <span class="Italics">[See Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span>.</p><h3>False-Positive Effects on Screening Tests for Benzodiazepines</h3><p class="First">False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for benzodiazepines have been reported in patients taking sertraline hydrochloride. This finding is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of sertraline hydrochloride. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will help distinguish sertraline hydrochloride from benzodiazepines <span class="Italics">[See Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</p><h3>QTc Prolongation</h3><p class="First">During post-marketing use of sertraline, cases of QTc prolongation and Torsade de Pointes (TdP) have been reported. Most reports were confounded by other risk factors. <span class="following_xmChange">In</span> a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled three-period crossover thorough QTc study in    54 healthy adult subjects, there was a positive relationship between the length of the rate-adjusted QTc interval and serum sertraline concentration. Therefore, sertraline hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for QTc prolongation   <span class="Italics">[See Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are described in more detail in other sections of the prescribing information:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data described below are from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of sertraline hydrochloride (mostly 50 mg to 200 mg per day) in 3066 adults diagnosed with MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, SAD, and PMDD. These 3066 patients exposed to sertraline hydrochloride for 8 to 12 weeks represent 568 patient-years of exposure. The mean age was 40 years; 57% were females and 43% were males.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (≥5% and twice placebo) in all pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials of all sertraline hydrochloride-treated patients with MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, SAD and PMDD were nausea, diarrhea/loose stool, tremor, dyspepsia, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, ejaculation failure, and decreased libido (see Table 3). The following are the most common adverse reactions in trials of sertraline hydrochloride (≥5% and twice placebo) by indication that were not mentioned previously.</p><ul class="Disc">

In placebo-controlled studies, the following were the common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in sertraline hydrochloride-treated patients:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, SAD and PMDD: nausea (3%), diarrhea (2%), agitation (2%), and insomnia (2%).</li>
<li>MDD (&gt;2% and twice placebo): decreased appetite, dizziness, fatigue, headache, somnolence, tremor, and vomiting.</li>
<li>OCD: somnolence.</li>
<li>PD: nervousness and somnolence.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction</span></p><p>Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of SSRI treatment. However, reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, in part because patients and healthcare providers may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in labeling may underestimate their actual incidence.</p><p>Table 4 below displays the incidence of sexual adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of sertraline hydrochloride-treated patients and twice placebo from pooled placebo-controlled trials. For men and all indications, the most common adverse reactions (&gt;2% and twice placebo) included: ejaculation failure, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, and male sexual dysfunction. For women, the most common adverse reaction (≥2% and twice placebo) was decreased libido.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4: Most Common Sexual Adverse Reactions (≥2% and twice placebo) in Men or Women from Sertraline Hydrochloride Pooled Controlled Trials in Adults with MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, SAD, and PMDD</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>In 281 pediatric patients treated with sertraline hydrochloride in placebo-controlled studies, the overall profile of adverse reactions was generally similar to that seen in adult studies.

These findings are based on post-marketing reports. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome.

The chronic administration of sertraline was found in animals to down regulate brain norepinephrine receptors. Sertraline does not inhibit monoamine oxidase.</p><p><span class="Bold">Alcohol</span></p><p>In healthy subjects, the acute cognitive and psychomotor effects of alcohol were not potentiated by sertraline hydrochloride oral solution.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>The effect of sertraline on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled three-period crossover thorough QTc study in 54 healthy adult subjects. At 2-fold the maximum recommended daily dose (~3-fold the steady-state exposure for sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline), the largest mean ΔΔQTc was 10 ms with upper bound of two-sided 90% confidence interval of 12 ms. The length of the QTc interval was also positively correlated with serum concentrations of sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline concentrations. These concentration-based analyses, however, indicated a lesser effect on QTc at maximally observed concentration than in the primary analysis <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5), Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7), Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following oral once-daily sertraline hydrochloride dosing over the range of 50 to 200 mg for 14 days, mean peak plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of sertraline occurred between 4.5 to 8.4 hours post-dosing. The average terminal elimination half-life of plasma sertraline is about 26 hours. Consistent with the terminal elimination half-life, there is an approximately two-fold accumulation up to steady-state concentrations, which are achieved after one week of once-daily dosing. Linear dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were demonstrated in a single dose study in which the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of sertraline were proportional to dose over a range of 50 to 200 mg. The single dose bioavailability of sertraline hydrochloride tablets is approximately equal to an equivalent dose of sertraline hydrochloride oral solution. Administration with food causes a small increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Sertraline undergoes extensive first pass metabolism. The principal initial pathway of metabolism for sertraline is N-demethylation. N-desmethylsertraline has a plasma terminal elimination half-life of 62 to 104 hours. Both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> biochemical and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> pharmacological testing have shown N-desmethylsertraline to be substantially less active than sertraline. Both sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline undergo oxidative deamination and subsequent reduction, hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation. In a study of radiolabeled sertraline involving two healthy male subjects, sertraline accounted for less than 5% of the plasma radioactivity. About 40 to 45% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine in 9 days. Unchanged sertraline was not detectable in the urine. For the same period, about 40 to 45% of the administered radioactivity was accounted for in feces, including 12 to 14% unchanged sertraline.</p><p>Desmethylsertraline exhibits time-related, dose dependent increases in AUC (0 to 24-hour), C<span class="Sub">max</span> and C<span class="Sub">min</span>, with about a 5- to 9-fold increase in these pharmacokinetic parameters between day 1 and day 14.</p><p><span class="Bold">Protein Binding</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> protein binding studies performed with radiolabeled 3H-sertraline showed that sertraline is highly bound to serum proteins (98%) in the range of 20 to 500 ng/mL.

The drugs for which this potential interaction is of greatest concern are those metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., tricyclic antidepressant drugs and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). The extent to which this interaction is an important clinical problem depends on the extent of the inhibition of CYP2D6 by the antidepressant and the therapeutic index of the co-administered drug. There is variability among the drugs effective in the treatment of MDD in the extent of clinically important 2D6 inhibition, and in fact sertraline hydrochloride at lower doses has a less prominent inhibitory effect on 2D6 than some others in the class.

The mean sertraline hydrochloride dose for completers was 70 mg/day.</p><p>Analyses for gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of sex.</p><h3>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults with OCD</span></p><p>The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of OCD was demonstrated in three multicenter placebo-controlled studies of adult (age 18 to 65) non-depressed outpatients (Studies OCD-1, OCD-2, and OCD-3). Patients in all three studies had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III or DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 25.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li> Study OCD-1 was an 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled study with flexible dosing of sertraline hydrochloride in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day, titrated in 50 mg increments every 4 days to a maximally tolerated dose; the mean dose for completers was 186 mg/day. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride (N=43) experienced a mean reduction of approximately 4 points on the Y-BOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the mean reduction of 2 points in placebo-treated patients (N=44). The mean change in Y-BOCS from baseline to last visit (the primary efficacy endpoint) was -3.79 (sertraline hydrochloride) and -1.48 (placebo).</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li> Study OCD-2 was a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled fixed-dose study, including sertraline hydrochloride doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/day. Sertraline hydrochloride (N=240) was titrated to the assigned dose over two weeks in 50 mg increments every 4 days. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride doses of 50 and 200 mg/day experienced mean reductions of approximately 6 points on the Y-BOCS total score, which were statistically significantly greater than the approximately 3 point reduction in placebo-treated patients (N=84). The mean change in Y-BOCS from baseline to last visit (the primary efficacy endpoint) was -5.7 (pooled results from sertraline hydrochloride 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg) and -2.85 (placebo).</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li> Study OCD-3 was a 12-week randomized, placebo controlled study with flexible dosing of sertraline hydrochloride in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day; the mean dose for completers was 185 mg/day. Sertraline hydrochloride (N=241) was titrated to the assigned dose over two weeks in 50 mg increments every 4 days. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the Y-BOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points in placebo-treated patients (N=84). The mean change in Y-BOCS from baseline to last visit (the primary efficacy endpoint) was -6.5 (sertraline hydrochloride) and -3.6 (placebo).</li>
</ul><p>Analyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex.</p><p>The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride was studied in the risk reduction of OCD relapse. In Study OCD-4, patients ranging in age from 18 to 79 meeting DSM-III-R criteria for OCD who had responded during a 52-week single-blind trial on sertraline hydrochloride 50 to 200 mg/day (n=224) were randomized to continuation of sertraline hydrochloride or to substitution of placebo for up to 28 weeks of observation for analysis of discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response. Response during the single-blind phase was defined as a decrease in the Y-BOCS score of ≥ 25% compared to baseline and a CGI-I of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved) or 3 (minimally improved). Insufficient clinical response during the double-blind phase indicated a worsening of the patient’s condition that resulted in study discontinuation, as assessed by the investigator. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as the following conditions being met (on three consecutive visits for 1 and 2, and condition 3 being met at visit 3):</p><ul class="Disc">
<li> Condition 1: Y-BOCS score increased by ≥  5 points, to a minimum of 20, relative to baseline;</li>
<li> Condition 2: CGI-I increased by ≥ one point; and</li>
<li> Condition 3: Worsening of the patient’s condition in the investigator’s judgment, to justify alternative treatment.</li>
</ul><p>Patients receiving continued sertraline hydrochloride treatment experienced a statistically significantly lower rate of discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response over the subsequent 28 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. This pattern was demonstrated in male and female subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients with OCD</span></p><p>The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride for the treatment of OCD was demonstrated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in a pediatric outpatient population (ages 6 to 17) (Study OCD-5). Sertraline hydrochloride (N=92) was initiated at doses of either 25 mg/day (pediatric patients ages 6 to 12) or 50 mg/day (adolescents, ages 13 to 17), and then titrated at 3 and 4 day intervals (25 mg incremental dose for pediatric patients ages 6 to 12) or 1 week intervals (50 mg incremental dose adolescents ages 13 to 17) over the next four weeks to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day, as tolerated. The mean dose for completers was       178 mg/day. Dosing was once a day in the morning or evening. Patients in this study had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) total score of 22. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 units on the CY-BOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the 3 unit reduction for placebo patients (n=95). Analyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex.</p><h3>Panic Disorder</h3><p class="First">The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of PD was demonstrated in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies PD-1, PD-2, and PD-3) of adult outpatients who had a primary diagnosis of PD (DSM-III-R), with or without agoraphobia.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li> Studies PD-1 and PD-2 were 10-week flexible dose studies of sertraline hydrochloride (N=80 study PD-1 and N=88 study PD-2) compared to placebo (N=176 study PD-1 and PD-2). In both studies, sertraline hydrochloride was initiated at 25 mg/day for the first week, then titrated in weekly increments of 50 mg per day to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and toleration. The mean sertraline hydrochloride doses for completers to 10 weeks were 131 mg/day and 144 mg/day, respectively, for Studies PD-1 and PD-2. In these studies, sertraline hydrochloride was shown to be statistically significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline in panic attack frequency and on the Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) of Illness and Global Improvement (CGI­-I) scores. The difference between sertraline hydrochloride and placebo in reduction from baseline in the number of full panic attacks was approximately 2 panic attacks per week in both studies.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li> Study PD-3 was a 12-week randomized, double-blind fixed-dose study, including sertraline hydrochloride doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/day. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride (50 mg N=43, 100 mg N=44, 200 mg N=45) experienced a statistically significantly greater reduction in panic attack frequency than patients receiving placebo (N=45). Study PD-3 was not readily interpretable regarding a dose response relationship for effectiveness.</li>
</ul><p>Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age, race, or gender.</p><p>In Study PD-4, patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for PD who had responded during a 52-week open trial on sertraline hydrochloride 50 to 200 mg/day (n=183) were randomized to continuation of sertraline hydrochloride or to substitution of placebo for up to 28 weeks of observation for discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response. Response during the open phase was defined as a CGI-I score of 1(very much improved) or 2 (much improved). Insufficient clinical response in the double-blind phase indicated a worsening of the patient’s condition that resulted in study discontinuation, as assessed by the investigator. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as the following conditions being met on three consecutive visits:</p><p>(1) CGI-I ≥ 3;</p><p>(2) meets DSM-III-R criteria for PD;</p><p>(3) number of panic attacks greater than at baseline.</p><p>Patients receiving continued sertraline hydrochloride treatment experienced a statistically significantly lower rate of discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response over the subsequent 28 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. This pattern was demonstrated in male and female subjects.</p><h3>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</h3><p class="First">The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of PTSD was established in two multicenter placebo-controlled studies (Studies PSTD-1 and PSTD-2) of adult outpatients who met DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD. The mean duration of PTSD for these patients was 12 years (Studies PSTD-1 and PSTD-2 combined) and 44% of patients (169 of the 385 patients treated) had secondary depressive disorder.</p><p>Studies PSTD-1 and PSTD-2 were 12-week flexible dose studies. Sertraline hydrochloride was initiated at 25 mg/day for the first week, and titrated in weekly increments of 50 mg per day to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and tolerability. The mean sertraline hydrochloride dose for completers was 146 mg/day and 151 mg/day, respectively, for Studies PSTD-1 and PSTD-2. Study outcome was assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale Part 2 (CAPS), which is a multi-item instrument that measures the three PTSD diagnostic symptom clusters of reexperiencing/intrusion, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal as well as the patient-rated Impact of Event Scale (IES), which measures intrusion and avoidance symptoms. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride (N=99 and N=94, respectively) showed statistically significant improvement compared to placebo (N=83 and N=92) on change from baseline to endpoint on the CAPS, IES, and on the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI-S) Severity of Illness and Global Improvement (CGI-I) scores.</p><p>In two additional placebo-controlled PTSD trials (Studies PSTD-3 and PSTD-4), the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant. One of these additional studies was conducted in patients similar to those recruited for Studies PSTD-1 and PSTD-2, while the second additional study was conducted in predominantly male veterans.</p><p>As PTSD is a more common disorder in women than men, the majority (76%) of patients in Studies PSTD-1 and PSTD-2 described above were women. Post hoc exploratory analyses revealed a statistically significant difference between sertraline hydrochloride and placebo on the CAPS, IES and CGI in women, regardless of baseline diagnosis of comorbid major depressive disorder, but essentially no effect in the relatively smaller number of men in these studies. The clinical significance of this apparent gender effect is unknown at this time. There was insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome.</p><p>In Study PSTD-5, patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD who had responded during a 24-week open trial on sertraline hydrochloride 50 to 200 mg/day (n=96) were randomized to continuation of sertraline hydrochloride or to substitution of placebo for up to 28 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open phase was defined as a CGI-I of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved), and a decrease in the CAPS-2 score of &gt; 30% compared to baseline. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as the following conditions being met on two consecutive visits:</p><p>(1) CGI-I ≥ 3;</p><p>(2) CAPS-2 score increased by ≥ 30% and by ≥ 15 points relative to baseline; and</p><p>(3) worsening of the patient's condition in the investigator's judgment.</p><p>Patients receiving continued sertraline hydrochloride treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 28 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. This pattern was demonstrated in male and female subjects.</p><h3>Social Anxiety Disorder</h3><p class="First">The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of SAD (also known as social phobia) was established in two multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled studies (Study SAD-1 and SAD-2) of adult outpatients who met DSM-­IV criteria for SAD.</p><p>Study SAD-1 was a 12-week, flexible dose study comparing sertraline hydrochloride (50 to 200 mg/day), n=211, to placebo, n=204, in which sertraline hydrochloride was initiated at 25 mg/day for the first week, then titrated to the maximum tolerated dose in 50 mg increments biweekly. Study outcomes were assessed by the:</p><p>(1)          Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), a 24-item clinician administered instrument that measures fear, anxiety, and avoidance of social and performance situations, and</p><p>(2)          Proportion of responders as defined by the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) criterion of CGI-I ≤ 2 (very much or much improved).</p><p>Sertraline hydrochloride was statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by the LSAS and the percentage of responders.</p><p>Study SAD-2 was a 20-week, flexible dose study that compared sertraline hydrochloride (50 to 200 mg/day), n=135, to placebo, n=69. Sertraline hydrochloride was titrated to the maximum tolerated dose in 50 mg increments every 3 weeks. Study outcome was assessed by the:</p><p>(1)          Duke Brief Social Phobia Scale (BSPS), a multi-item clinician-rated instrument that measures fear, avoidance and physiologic response to social or performance situations,</p><p>(2)          Marks Fear Questionnaire Social Phobia Subscale (FQ-SPS), a 5-item patient-rated instrument that measures change in the severity of phobic avoidance and distress, and</p><p>(3)          CGI-I responder criterion of ≤ 2.</p><p>Sertraline hydrochloride was shown to be statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by the BSPS total score and fear, avoidance and physiologic factor scores, as well as the FQ-SPS total score, and to have statistically significantly more responders than placebo as defined by the CGI-I. Subgroup analyses did not suggest differences in treatment outcome on the basis of gender. There was insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome.</p><p>In Study SAD-3, patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for SAD who had responded while assigned to sertraline hydrochloride (CGI-I of 1 or 2) during a 20-week placebo-controlled trial on sertraline hydrochloride 50 to 200 mg/day were randomized to continuation of sertraline hydrochloride or to substitution of placebo for up to 24 weeks of observation for relapse. Relapse was defined as ≥ 2 point increase in the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score compared to baseline or study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride continuation treatment experienced a statistically significantly lower relapse rate during this 24-week period than patients randomized to placebo substitution.</p><h3>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder</h3><p class="First">The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride for the treatment of PMDD was established in two double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled flexible dose trials (Studies PMDD-1 and PMDD-2) conducted over 3 menstrual cycles in adult female patients. The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride for PMDD for more than 3 menstrual cycles has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials.</p><p>Patients in Study PMDD-1 met DSM-III-R criteria for Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder (LLPDD), the clinical entity referred to as PMDD in DSM-IV. Patients in Study PMDD-2 met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD. Study PMDD-1 utilized continuous daily dosing throughout the study, while Study PMDD-2 utilized luteal phase dosing (intermittent dosing) for the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses. The mean duration of PMDD symptoms was approximately 10.5 years in both studies. Patients taking oral contraceptives were excluded from these trials; therefore, the efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride in combination with oral contraceptives for the treatment of PMDD is unknown.</p><p>Efficacy was assessed with the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP), a patient-rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria for PMDD as identified in the DSM-IV, and includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms, and other symptoms. Other efficacy assessments included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17), and the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scores.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li> In Study PMDD-1, involving 251 randomized patients, (n=125 on sertraline hydrochloride and n=126 on placebo), sertraline hydrochloride treatment was initiated at 50 mg/day and administered daily throughout the menstrual cycle. In subsequent cycles, sertraline hydrochloride was titrated in 50 mg increments at the beginning of each menstrual cycle up to a maximum of 150 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and tolerability. The mean dose for completers was 102 mg/day. Sertraline hydrochloride administered daily throughout the menstrual cycle was statistically significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline to endpoint on the DRSP total score, the HAMD-17 total score, and the CGI-S score, as well as the CGI-I score at endpoint.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li> In Study PMDD-2, involving 281 randomized patients, (n=142 on sertraline hydrochloride and n=139 on placebo), sertraline hydrochloride treatment was initiated at 50 mg/day in the late luteal phase (last 2 weeks) of each menstrual cycle and then discontinued at the onset of menses (intermittent dosing). In subsequent cycles, patients were dosed in the range of 50 to 100 mg/day in the luteal phase of each cycle, on the basis of clinical response and tolerability. Patients who received 100 mg/day started with 50 mg/day for the first 3 days of the cycle, then 100 mg/day for the remainder of the cycle. The mean sertraline hydrochloride dose for completers was 74 mg/day. Sertraline hydrochloride administered in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle was statistically significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline to endpoint on the DRSP total score and the CGI-S score, as well as the CGI-I score at endpoint (Week 12).</li>
