This is called passive protection. This passive protection lasts long enough to protect your body until your body can produce its own antibodies against VZV.</p><p>Varicella (commonly known as chickenpox) is an infection that is easily spread from one person to another. Chickenpox is usually a mild infection but sometimes it can cause serious problems, such as pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, and a rare disease called Reye's syndrome.</p><p>Varicella-zoster immune globulin is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor or other health care professional.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using varicella-zoster immune globulin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For varicella-zoster immune globulin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to varicella-zoster immune globulin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of varicella-zoster immune globulin in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of varicella-zoster immune globulin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have blood clotting problems which may require caution in patients receiving varicella-zoster immune globulin.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving varicella-zoster immune globulin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using varicella-zoster immune globulin with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of varicella-zoster immune globulin.

Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Varicella-zoster immune globulin may cause serious types of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.

Tell your doctor right away if you have chest pain, trouble breathing, numbness or weakness in your arm or leg, or on one side of your body, trouble seeing or speaking, or sudden or severe headache.</p><p>Varicella-zoster immune globulin is made from donated human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted viruses to people who have received them, although the risk is low. Human donors and donated blood are both tested for viruses to keep the transmission risk low. Talk with your doctor about this risk if you are concerned.</p><p>While you are being treated with varicella-zoster immune globulin, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Live virus vaccines (e.g., measles, mumps, rubella, varicella) should not be given within 3 months after receiving varicella-zoster immune globulin.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Varicella-zoster immune globulin side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
