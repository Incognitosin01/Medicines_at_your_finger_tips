The chemical name for tramadol hydrochloride is (±) <span class="Italics">cis</span> -2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-1-(3-methoxyphenyl) cyclohexanol hydrochloride. Its structural formula is:</p><p>Ultram ODT is supplied as orally disintegrating tablets containing 50 mg of tramadol hydrochloride for oral administration.</p><p>Tramadol hydrochloride is a white, bitter, crystalline and odorless powder. It is readily soluble in water and ethanol and has a pKa of 9.41. The n-octanol/water log partition coefficient (logP) is 1.35 at pH 7.</p><p>The tablets are white in color and contain the inactive ingredients aspartame, copovidone, crospovidone, ethylcellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, mint flavor, and silicon dioxide.</p><h2>Ultram ODT - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Ultram ODT is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic in an orally disintegrating tablet form. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M1 metabolite to µ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.</p><p>Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M1 to µ-opioid receptors. In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in µ-opioid binding. Tramadol-induced analgesia is only partially antagonized by the opiate antagonist naloxone in several animal tests. The relative contribution of both tramadol and M1 to human analgesia is dependent upon the plasma concentrations of each compound (see <span class="Bold Italics">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics</span>).</p><p>Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, as have some other opioid analgesics. These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol. Analgesia in humans begins approximately within one hour after administration and reaches a peak in approximately two to three hours.</p><p>Apart from analgesia, tramadol administration may produce a constellation of symptoms (including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, sweating and pruritus) similar to that of other opioids. In contrast to morphine, tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release. At therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular function or cardiac index. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The analgesic activity of tramadol is due to both parent drug and the M1 metabolite (see <span class="Bold Italics">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamic</span>). Tramadol is administered as a racemate and both the [−] and [+] forms of both tramadol and M1 are detected in the circulation. Tramadol is well absorbed orally with an absolute bioavailability of 75%. Tramadol has a volume of distribution of approximately 2.7 L/kg and is 20% bound to plasma proteins. Tramadol is extensively metabolized by a number of pathways, including CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, as well as by conjugation of parent and metabolites. One metabolite, M1, is pharmacologically active in animal models. The formation of M1 is dependent upon CYP2D6 and as such is subject to inhibition, which may affect the therapeutic response (see <span class="Bold Italics">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</span>). Tramadol and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine with observed plasma half-lives of 6.3 and 7.4 hours for tramadol and M1, respectively. Linear pharmacokinetics have been observed following multiple doses of 50 and 100 mg to steady-state.</p><p>No difference has been identified in systemic exposure (AUC), peak exposure (C<span class="Sub">max</span>), time to peak exposure (T<span class="Sub">max</span>), and apparent elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of tramadol and metabolites M1 and M5 between administration of Ultram ODT with and without water and Ultram<span class="Sup">®</span>.</p><p class="First">Racemic tramadol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. The mean absolute bioavailability of a 100 mg oral dose is approximately 75%. The mean peak plasma concentration of racemic tramadol and M1 occurs at two and three hours, respectively, after administration in healthy adults. In general, both enantiomers of tramadol and M1 follow a parallel time course in the body following single and multiple doses although small differences (~ 10%) exist in the absolute amount of each enantiomer present.</p><p>Steady-state plasma concentrations of both tramadol and M1 are achieved within two days with q.i.d. dosing. There is no evidence of self-induction (see Figure 1 and Table 1 below).</p><p>Figure 1: Mean Tramadol and M1 Plasma Concentration Profiles after a Single 100 mg Oral Dose and after Twenty-Nine 100 mg Oral Doses of Tramadol HCl given q.i.d.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Food Effects:</span> Oral administration of Ultram ODT with food does not significantly affect its extent of absorption, however, food does delay t<span class="Sub">max</span> by about 30 minutes compared to fasting conditions. The clinical significance of this delay is not known.</p><p class="First">The volume of distribution of tramadol was 2.6 and 2.9 liters/kg in male and female subjects, respectively, following a 100 mg intravenous dose. The binding of tramadol to human plasma proteins is approximately 20% and binding also appears to be independent of concentration up to 10 µg/mL. Saturation of plasma protein binding occurs only at concentrations outside the clinically relevant range.</p><p class="First">Tramadol is extensively metabolized after oral administration. Approximately 30% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, whereas 60% of the dose is excreted as metabolites. The remainder is excreted either as unidentified or as unextractable metabolites. The major metabolic pathways appear to be N- and O- demethylation and glucuronidation or sulfation in the liver. One metabolite (O-desmethyltramadol, denoted M1) is pharmacologically active in animal models. Formation of M1 is dependent on CYP2D6 and as such is subject to inhibition, which may affect the therapeutic response (see <span class="Bold Italics">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interaction</span>).</p><p>Approximately 7% of the population has reduced activity of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme of cytochrome P-450. These individuals are "poor metabolizers" of debrisoquine, dextromethorphan, tricyclic antidepressants, among other drugs. Based on a population PK analysis of Phase I studies in healthy subjects, concentrations of tramadol were approximately 20% higher in "poor metabolizers" versus "extensive metabolizers," while M1 concentrations were 40% lower. Concomitant therapy with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine, paroxetine and quinidine could result in significant drug interactions. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine, amitriptyline and quinidine inhibit the metabolism of tramadol to various degrees, suggesting that concomitant administration of these compounds could result in increases in tramadol concentrations and decreased concentrations of M1. The full pharmacological impact of these alterations in terms of either efficacy or safety is unknown. Concomitant use of SEROTONIN re-uptake INHIBITORS and MAO INHIBITORS may enhance the risk of adverse events, including seizure (see <span class="Bold Italics">WARNINGS</span>) and serotonin syndrome.</p><p class="First">Tramadol is eliminated primarily through metabolism by the liver and the metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys. The mean terminal plasma elimination half-lives of racemic tramadol and racemic M1 are 6.3 ± 1.4 and 7.4 ± 1.4 hours, respectively. The plasma elimination half-life of racemic tramadol increased from approximately six hours to seven hours upon multiple dosing.</p><p class="First">Special Populations</p><p class="First">Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite, M1. In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, adjustment of the dosing regimen is recommended (see <span class="Bold Italics">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4-hour dialysis period is less than 7% of the administered dose.</p><p class="First">Metabolism of tramadol and M1 is reduced in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, resulting in both a larger area under the concentration time curve for tramadol and longer tramadol and M1 elimination half-lives (13 hrs. for tramadol and 19 hrs. for M1). In cirrhotic patients, adjustment of the dosing regimen is recommended (see <span class="Bold Italics">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p class="First">Healthy elderly subjects aged 65 to 75 years have plasma tramadol concentrations and elimination half-lives comparable to those observed in healthy subjects less than 65 years of age. In subjects over 75 years, maximum serum concentrations are elevated (208 vs. 162 ng/mL) and the elimination half-life is prolonged (7 vs. 6 hours) compared to subjects 65 to 75 years of age. Adjustment of the daily dose is recommended for patients older than 75 years (see <span class="Bold Italics">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p class="First">Following a single oral dose of Ultram ODT to healthy volunteers, no gender effect was observed. The AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> values for Ultram ODT were similar in males and females. Dosage adjustment based on gender is not recommended.</p><p>The absolute bioavailability of tramadol was 73% in males and 79% in females. The plasma clearance was 6.4 mL/min/kg in males and 5.7 mL/min/kg in females following a 100 mg dose of tramadol.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Ultram ODT is an orally disintegrating tablet, but there are no studies that indicate that its onset of action is faster than tramadol tablets.</p><p>An orally swallowed immediate release tablet of tramadol has been given in single oral doses of 50, 75 and 100 mg to patients with pain following surgical procedures and pain following oral surgery (extraction of impacted molars).</p><p>In single-dose models of pain following oral surgery, pain relief was demonstrated in some patients at doses of 50 mg and 75 mg. A dose of 100 mg of orally swallowed immediate release tablet of tramadol tended to provide analgesia superior to codeine sulfate 60 mg, but it was not as effective as the combination of aspirin 650 mg with codeine phosphate 60 mg.</p><p>An orally swallowed immediate release tablet of tramadol has been studied in three long-term controlled trials involving a total of 820 patients, with 530 patients receiving an orally swallowed immediate release tablet of tramadol. Patients with a variety of chronic painful conditions were studied in double-blind trials of one to three months duration. Average daily doses of approximately 250 mg of an orally swallowed immediate release tablet of tramadol in divided doses were generally comparable to five doses of acetaminophen 300 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg daily, five doses of aspirin 325 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg daily, or two to three doses of acetaminophen 500 mg with oxycodone hydrochloride 5 mg daily.</p><h3>Titration Trials</h3><p class="First">In a randomized, blinded clinical study with 129 to 132 patients per group, a 10-day titration to a daily orally swallowed immediate release tablet of tramadol dose of 200 mg (50 mg q.i.d.), attained in 50 mg increments every 3 days, was found to result in fewer discontinuations due to dizziness or vertigo than titration over only 4 days or no titration.</p><p>Figure 2: Protocol CAPSS –047 Time to Discontinuation Due to Nausea/Vomiting</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Ultram ODT</h2><p class="First">Ultram ODT is indicated for the management of moderate to moderately severe pain in adults.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Ultram ODT should not be administered to patients who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to tramadol, any other component of this product or <span class="Bold">other</span> opioids. Ultram ODT is contraindicated in any situation where other opioids are contraindicated, including acute intoxication with any of the following: alcohol, hypnotics, narcotics, centrally acting analgesics, opioids or psychotropic drugs. Ultram ODT may worsen central nervous system and respiratory depression in these patients.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><h3>Seizure Risk</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Concomitant use of Ultram ODT increases the seizure risk in patients taking:</span></p><ul>
<li><span class="Bold">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI antidepressants or anorectics),</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and other tricyclic compounds (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, promethazine, etc.), or</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Other Opioid drugs.</span></li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Administration of Ultram ODT may enhance the seizure risk in patients taking:</span></p><ul>
<li><span class="Bold">MAO inhibitors (see also <span class="Italics">WARNINGS</span>– Use with MAO Inhibitors),</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Neuroleptics, or</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Other drugs that reduce the seizure threshold.</span></li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Risk of convulsions may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures, or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders, alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections). In Ultram ODT overdose, naloxone administration may increase the risk of seizure.</span></p><h3>Anaphylactoid Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol. When these events do occur it is often following the first dose. Other reported allergic reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients with a history of anaphylactoid reactions to codeine and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive Ultram ODT (see <span class="Bold Italics">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p><h3>Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Administer Ultram ODT cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression. In these patients alternative non-opioid analgesics should be considered. When large doses of tramadol are administered with anesthetic medications or alcohol, respiratory depression may result. Respiratory depression should be treated as an overdose. If naloxone is to be administered, use cautiously because it may precipitate seizures (see <span class="Bold Italics">WARNINGS, Seizure Risk</span> <span class="Bold Italics">and</span> <span class="Bold Italics">OVERDOSAGE</span>).</p><h3>Interaction With Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants</h3><p class="First">Ultram ODT should be used with caution and in reduced dosages when administered to patients receiving CNS depressants such as alcohol, other opioids, anesthetic agents, narcotics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics. Tramadol increases the risk of CNS and respiratory depression in these patients.</p><h3>Increased Intracranial Pressure or Head Trauma</h3><p class="First">Ultram ODT should be used with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury. The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in these patients. Additionally, pupillary changes (miosis) from tramadol may obscure the existence, extent, or course of intracranial pathology. Clinicians should also maintain a high index of suspicion for adverse drug reaction when evaluating altered mental status in these patients if they are receiving Ultram ODT (see <span class="Bold Italics">Respiratory Depression</span>).</p><h3>Sensitivity to phenylketone</h3><p class="First">Patients with a history of sensitivity to phenylketones may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive Ultram ODT.</p><h3>Use in Ambulatory Patients</h3><p class="First">Ultram ODT may impair the mental and or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. The patient using this drug should be cautioned accordingly.</p><h3>Use With MAO Inhibitors And Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Use Ultram ODT with great caution in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Animal studies have shown increased deaths with combined administration. Concomitant use of tramadol with MAO inhibitors or SSRI's increases the risk of adverse events, including seizure and serotonin syndrome.</p><h3>Withdrawal</h3><p class="First">Withdrawal symptoms may occur if Ultram ODT is discontinued abruptly (see <span class="Bold Italics">DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</span>). These symptoms may include: anxiety, sweating, insomnia, rigors, pain, nausea, tremors, diarrhea, upper respiratory symptoms, piloerection, and rarely hallucinations. Other symptoms that have been seen less frequently with tramadol discontinuation include: panic attacks, severe anxiety, and paresthesias. Clinical experience suggests that withdrawal symptoms may be relieved by tapering the medication.</p><h3>Physical Dependence and Abuse</h3><p class="First">Ultram ODT may induce psychic and physical dependence of the morphine-type (µ-opioid) (see <span class="Bold Italics">DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</span>). Ultram ODT should not be used in opioid-dependent patients. Tramadol has been shown to reinitiate physical dependence in some patients who have been previously dependent on other opioids. Dependence and abuse, including drug-seeking behavior and taking illicit actions to obtain the drug, are not limited to those patients with prior history of opioid dependence.</p><h3>Risk of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">Serious potential consequences of overdosage with tramadol hydrochloride tablets are central nervous system depression, respiratory depression and death. In treating an overdose, primary attention should be given to maintaining adequate ventilation along with general supportive treatment (see <span class="Bold Italics">OVERDOSAGE</span>).</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>Acute Abdominal Conditions</h3><p class="First">The administration of Ultram ODT may complicate the clinical assessment of patients with acute abdominal conditions.</p><h3>Use in Renal and Hepatic Disease</h3><p class="First">Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite, M1. In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, dosing reduction is recommended (see <span class="Bold Italics">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). Metabolism of tramadol and M1 is reduced in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver. In cirrhotic patients, dosing reduction is recommended (see <span class="Bold Italics">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p>With the prolonged half-life in these conditions, achievement of steady-state is delayed, so that it may take several days for elevated plasma concentrations to develop.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><ul>
<li>Ultram ODT may impair mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery.</li>
<li>Ultram ODT should not be taken with alcohol containing beverages.</li>

<li>Do NOT chew, break, or split the tablet.</li>
<li>Phenylketonurics: Ultram ODT contains phenylalanine.</li>
</ul><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicate that tramadol is unlikely to inhibit the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of other drugs when tramadol is administered concomitantly at therapeutic doses. Tramadol does not appear to induce its own metabolism in humans, since observed maximal plasma concentrations after multiple oral doses are higher than expected based on single-dose data. Tramadol is a mild inducer of selected drug metabolism pathways measured in animals.</p><p class="First">Patients taking <span class="Bold">carbamazepine</span> may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol. Because carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol, concomitant administration of Ultram ODT and carbamazepine is not recommended.</p><p class="First">Tramadol is metabolized to M1 by CYP2D6. <span class="Bold">Quinidine</span> is a selective inhibitor of the isoenzyme, so that concomitant administration of quinidine and tramadol results in increased concentrations of tramadol and reduced concentrations of M1. The clinical consequences of these findings are unknown. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tramadol has no effect on quinidine metabolism.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that concomitant administration with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and amitriptyline could result in some inhibition of the metabolism of tramadol.</p><p class="First">Concomitant administration with <span class="Bold">cimetidine</span> does not result in clinically significant changes in tramadol pharmacokinetics. Therefore, no alteration of the Ultram ODT dosage regimen is recommended.</p><p class="First">Interactions with <span class="Bold">MAO Inhibitors,</span> due to interference with detoxification mechanisms, have been reported for some centrally acting drugs (see <span class="Bold Italics">WARNINGS, Use With MAO Inhibitors</span>).</p><p class="First">Post-marketing surveillance of tramadol has revealed rare reports of digoxin toxicity and alteration of warfarin effect, including elevation of prothrombin times.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">A slight, but statistically significant, increase in two common murine tumors, pulmonary and hepatic, was observed in a mouse carcinogenicity study, particularly in aged mice. Mice were dosed orally up to 30 mg/kg (90 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or 0.36 times the maximum daily human dosage of 246 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) for approximately two years, although the study was not done with the Maximum Tolerated Dose. This finding is not believed to suggest risk in humans. No such finding occurred in a rat carcinogenicity study (dosing orally up to 30 mg/kg, 180 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, or 0.73 times the maximum daily human dosage).</p><p>Tramadol was not mutagenic in the following assays: Ames Salmonella microsomal activation test, CHO/HPRT mammalian cell assay, mouse lymphoma assay (in the absence of metabolic activation), dominant lethal mutation tests in mice, chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamsters, and bone marrow micronucleus tests in mice and Chinese hamsters. Weakly mutagenic results occurred in the presence of metabolic activation in the mouse lymphoma assay and micronucleus test in rats. Overall, the weight of evidence from these tests indicates that tramadol does not pose a genotoxic risk to humans.</p><p>No effects on fertility were observed for tramadol at oral dose levels up to 50 mg/kg (300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) in male rats and 75 mg/kg (450 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) in female rats. These dosages are 1.2 and 1.8 times the maximum daily human dosage of 246 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy,</span> Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C.</p><p>Tramadol has been shown to be embryotoxic and fetotoxic in mice, (120 mg/kg or 360 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), rats (≥25 mg/kg or 150 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) and rabbits (≥75 mg/kg or 900 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) at maternally toxic dosages, but was not teratogenic at these dose levels. These dosages on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis are 1.4, ≥0.6, and ≥3.6 times the maximum daily human dosage (246 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) for mouse, rat and rabbit, respectively.</p><p>No drug-related teratogenic effects were observed in progeny of mice (up to 140 mg/kg or 420 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), rats (up to 80 mg/kg or 480 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) or rabbits (up to 300 mg/kg or 3600 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) treated with tramadol by various routes. Embryo and fetal toxicity consisted primarily of decreased fetal weights, skeletal ossification and increased supernumerary ribs at maternally toxic dose levels. Transient delays in developmental or behavioral parameters were also seen in pups from rat dams allowed to deliver. Embryo and fetal lethality were reported only in one rabbit study at 300 mg/kg (3600 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), a dose that would cause extreme maternal toxicity in the rabbit. The dosages listed for mouse, rat and rabbit are 1.7, 1.9 and 14.6 times the maximum daily human dosage (246 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), respectively.</p><p class="First">Tramadol was evaluated in peri- and post-natal studies in rats. Progeny of dams receiving oral (gavage) dose levels of 50 mg/kg (300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or 1.2 times the maximum daily human tramadol dosage) or greater had decreased weights, and pup survival was decreased early in lactation at 80 mg/kg (480 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or 1.9 and higher the maximum daily human dose).</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tramadol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Neonatal seizures, neonatal withdrawal syndrome, fetal death and still birth have been reported during post-marketing.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">Ultram ODT should not be used in pregnant women prior to or during labor unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Safe use in pregnancy has not been established. Chronic use during pregnancy may lead to physical dependence and post-partum withdrawal symptoms in the newborn (see <span class="Bold Italics">DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</span>). Tramadol has been shown to cross the placenta. The mean ratio of serum tramadol in the umbilical veins compared to maternal veins was 0.83 for 40 women given tramadol during labor.</p><p>The effect of tramadol if any, on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child is unknown.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Ultram ODT is not recommended for obstetrical preoperative medication or for post-delivery analgesia in nursing mothers because its safety in infants and newborns has not been studied. Following a single IV 100 mg dose of tramadol, the cumulative excretion in breast milk within 16 hours postdose was 100 µg of tramadol (0.1% of the maternal dose) and 27 µg of M1.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of Ultram ODT in patients under 16 years of age have not been established. The use of Ultram ODT in the pediatric population is not recommended.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In patients over 75 years of age, daily doses in excess of 300 mg are not recommended (see <span class="Bold Italics">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span> <span class="Bold Italics">and</span> <span class="Bold Italics">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p>A total of 455 elderly (65 years of age or older) subjects were exposed to tramadol in controlled clinical trials. Of those, 145 subjects were 75 years of age and older.</p><p>In studies including geriatric patients, treatment-limiting adverse events were higher in subjects over 75 years of age compared to those under 65 years of age. Specifically, 30% of those over 75 years of age had gastrointestinal treatment-limiting adverse events compared to 17% of those under 65 years of age. Constipation resulted in discontinuation of treatment in 10% of those over 75.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">An orally swallowed immediate release tablet of tramadol was administered to 550 patients during the double-blind or open-label extension periods in U.S. studies of chronic nonmalignant pain. Of these patients, 375 were 65 years old or older. Table 2 reports the cumulative incidence rate of adverse reactions by 7, 30 and 90 days for the most frequent reactions (5% or more by 7 days). The most frequently reported events were in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal system. Although the reactions listed in the table are felt to be probably related to tramadol administration, the reported rates also include some events that may have been due to underlying disease or concomitant medication. The overall incidence rates of adverse experiences in these trials were similar for tramadol and the active control groups, acetaminophen 300 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg, and aspirin 325 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg, however, the rates of withdrawals due to adverse events appeared to be higher in the tramadol groups.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Incidence 1% to less than 5%, possibly causally related:</span><br/>

A causal relationship between tramadol and these events has not been determined. However, the most significant events are listed below as alerting information to the physician.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular:</span> Abnormal ECG, Hypertension, Hypotension, Myocardial ischemia, Palpitations, Pulmonary edema, Pulmonary embolism.</p><p><span class="Bold">Central Nervous System:</span> Migraine, Speech disorders.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal:</span> Gastrointestinal bleeding, Hepatitis, Stomatitis, Liver failure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Abnormalities:</span> Creatinine increase, Elevated liver enzymes, Hemoglobin decrease, Proteinuria.</p><p><span class="Bold">Sensory:</span> Cataracts, Deafness, Tinnitus.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><p class="First">Ultram ODT may induce psychic and physical dependence of the morphine-type (µ-opioid) (see <span class="Bold Italics">WARNINGS</span>). Dependence and abuse, including drug-seeking behavior and taking illicit actions to obtain the drug are not limited to those patients with prior history of opioid dependence. The risk in patients with substance abuse has been observed to be higher. Tramadol is associated with craving and tolerance development. Withdrawal symptoms may occur if Ultram ODT is discontinued abruptly. These symptoms may include: anxiety, sweating, insomnia, rigors, pain, nausea, tremors, diarrhea, upper respiratory symptoms, piloerection, and rarely hallucinations. Other symptoms that have been seen less frequently with reference listed drug discontinuation include: panic attacks, severe anxiety, and paresthesias. Clinical experience suggests that withdrawal symptoms may be relieved by reinstitution of opioid therapy followed by a gradual, tapered dose reduction of the medication combined with symptomatic support.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Serious potential consequences of overdosage are respiratory depression, lethargy, coma, seizure, cardiac arrest and death (see <span class="Bold Italics">WARNINGS</span>). Fatalities have been reported in post marketing in association with both intentional and unintentional overdose with tramadol. In treating an overdose, primary attention should be given to maintaining adequate ventilation along with general supportive treatment. While naloxone will reverse some, but not all, symptoms caused by overdosage with tramadol, the risk of seizures is also increased with naloxone administration. In animals convulsions following the administration of toxic doses of tramadol could be suppressed with barbiturates or benzodiazepines but were increased with naloxone. Naloxone administration did not change the lethality of an overdose in mice. Hemodialysis is not expected to be helpful in an overdose because it removes less than 7% of the administered dose in a 4-hour dialysis period.</p><h2>Ultram ODT Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Do NOT chew, break, or split the tablet.</p><p class="First">Adults (17 years of age and over)</p><p>For patients with moderate to moderately severe chronic pain not requiring rapid onset of analgesic effect, the tolerability of tramadol hydrochloride tablets can be improved by initiating therapy with a titration regimen. The total daily dose may be increased by 50 mg as tolerated every 3 days to reach 200 mg/day (50 mg q.i.d.). After titration, Ultram ODT 50 to 100 mg can be administered as needed for pain relief every 4 to 6 hours <span class="Bold">not to exceed 400 mg/day.</span></p><p>For the subset of patients for whom rapid onset of analgesic effect is required and for whom the benefits outweigh the risk of discontinuation due to adverse events associated with higher initial doses, Ultram ODT 50 mg to 100 mg can be administered as needed for pain relief every 4 to 6 hours, <span class="Bold">not to exceed 400 mg per day.</span></p><p>Place Ultram ODT tablet on the tongue until it completely disintegrates and then swallow it. It may take approximately one minute for the tablet to disintegrate on the tongue. Tablet may be taken with or without water.</p><h3>Individualization of Dose</h3><p class="First">Good pain management practice dictates that the dose be individualized according to patient need using the lowest beneficial dose. Studies with tramadol in adults have shown that starting at the lowest possible dose and titrating upward will result in fewer discontinuations and increased tolerability.</p><p>In all patients with <span class="Bold">creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min,</span> it is recommended that the dosing interval of Ultram ODT be increased to 12 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Since only 7% of an administered dose is removed by hemodialysis, <span class="Bold">dialysis patients</span> can receive their regular dose on the day of dialysis.</p><p>The recommended dose for adult patients with <span class="Bold">cirrhosis</span> is 50 mg every 12 hours.</p><p>In general, dose selection for an elderly patient over 65 years old should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. For elderly patients <span class="Bold">over 75 years old,</span> total dose should not exceed 300 mg/day.</p><h2>How is Ultram ODT Supplied</h2><p class="First">Ultram ODT (tramadol hydrochloride) Orally Disintegrating Tablets are 50 mg white tablets, debossed with "B" on one side and "50" on the other side, and supplied in cartons of 30 tablets (5 cards of 6 single dose units) in child resistant blister packs.</p><p>NDC #0062-0660-30</p><p>Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15-30°C (59-86°F).</p><p class="First">Manufactured by :<br/>
