</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Immunological Agent</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Interferon Gamma</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for interferon gamma-1b</h2><p>Interferon gamma-1b injection is used to lower the frequency and severity of serious infections caused by chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). It is also used to slow down the progression of severe, malignant osteopetrosis (SMO). Interferon gamma-1b is a man-made version of a substance naturally produced by cells in the body to help fight infections and tumors.</p><p>Interferon gamma-1b is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using interferon gamma-1b</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For interferon gamma-1b, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to interferon gamma-1b or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Actimmune® to treat CGD in children 1 year of age and older, and to treat SMO in children 1 month and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children to treat CGD younger than 1 year of age, and in newborns with SMO.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Actimmune® in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving Actimmune®.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of interferon gamma-1b. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Arrhythmia (heart rhythm problem) or</li>
<li>Congestive heart failure or</li>
<li>Heart disease (eg, ischemia) or</li>
<li>Nervous system problems, or history of or</li>
<li>Seizures—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Kidney disease or</li>
<li>Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of interferon gamma-1b</h2><p>Interferon gamma-1b is given as a shot under your skin, usually in the right and left upper arms, or thighs.</p><p>Each package of interferon gamma-1b contains a patient instruction sheet. Read this sheet carefully and make sure you understand:</p><ul>
<li>How to prepare the injection.</li>
<li>Proper use of disposable syringes.</li>
<li>How to give the injection.</li>
<li>How long the injection is stable.</li>
</ul><p>If you have any questions about any of this, check with your doctor.</p><p>You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections.</p><p>Use each vial only one time. Do not save an open vial. If the medicine in the vial has changed color, or if you see particles in it, do not use it. Do not shake it.</p><p>Do not mix it with other medicines in the same syringe.</p><p>You may have fewer side effects (headache, fever, or muscle aches) if you give yourself the shot just before bedtime. Ask your doctor if you can take acetaminophen to prevent or relieve side effects.</p><p>Throw away used needles in a hard, closed container that the needles cannot poke through. Keep this container away from children and pets.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of interferon gamma-1b will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of interferon gamma-1b. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Interferon gamma-1b commonly causes flu-like reactions, with aching muscles, fever and chills, and headache. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully about taking your temperature, and how much and when to take the acetaminophen to treat fever and pain.</p><p>Interferon gamma-1b may cause dizziness, decreased mental status, clumsiness, or trouble walking. <i>Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how interferon gamma-1b affects you</i>.</p><p>Actimmune® can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.</p><p>Interferon gamma-1b may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using interferon gamma-1b.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you change in how much or how often you urinate, lower back or side pain, difficult or painful urination.</p><p>The stopper of the vial contains natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you have a latex allergy before you start using interferon gamma-1b.</p><p>While you are being treated with Actimmune® and after you stop using it, do not have any vaccines without your doctor's approval. Actimmune® may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Interferon gamma-1b side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
