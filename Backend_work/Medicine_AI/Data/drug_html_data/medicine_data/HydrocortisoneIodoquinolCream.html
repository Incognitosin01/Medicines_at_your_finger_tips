While the mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity is unclear, there is evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and the therapeutic efficacy in humans lodoquinol has both antifungal and antibacterial properties.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The extent of the percutaneous absorption of topical steroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier and the use of occlusive dressings. Hydrocortisone can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other inflammatory disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Once absorbed through the skin, hydrocortisone is metabolized in the liver and most body tissue to hydrogeneted and degraded forms such as tetrahydrocortisone and tetrahydrocortisol. These are excreted in the urine, mainly conjugated as glucuronides, together with a very small proportion of unchanged hydrocortisone. There are no data available regarding the percutaneous absorption of iodoquinol; however, following oral administration, 3-5% of the dose was recovered in the urine as glucuronide.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Based on a review of a related drug by the National Research Council and subsequent FDA classification for that drug, the indications are as follows: "Possibly" Effective: Contact or atopic dermatitis; impetiginized eczema; nummular eczema; endogenous chronic infectious dermatitis; stasis dermatitis; pyoderma; nuchal eczema and chronic eczematoid otitis externa; acne urticata; localized or disseminated neurodermatitis; lichen simplex chronicus; anogenital pruritus (vulvae, scroti, ani); folliculitis; bacterial dermatoses; mycotic dermatoses such as tinea (capitis, cruris, corporis, pedis); moniliasis; intertrigo. Final classification of the less-than-effective indications requires further investigation.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in persons with known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of the product.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NOT FOR OPHTHALMIC USE.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.</span></p><p>Avoid contact with eyes, lips and mucous membranes.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">If irritation develops, the use of this product should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Staining of the skin, hair and fabrics may occur. Not intended for the use on infants or under diapers of occlusive dressings. If extensive areas are treated or if the occlusive dressing technique is used, the possibility exists of increased systemic absorption of the corticosteroid, and suitable precautions should be taken.</p><p>Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity.</p><p>Iodoquinol may be absorbed through the skin and interfere with thyroid function tests. If such tests are contemplated, wait at least one month after discontinuance of therapy to perform these tests. The ferric chloride test for phenylketonuria (PKU) can yield a false positive result if iodoquinol is present in the diaper or urine. Prolonged use may result on overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms requiring appropriate therapy.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies for carcinogenic potential have not been performed on this product to date. In vitro studies to determine mutagenicity with hydrocortisone have revealed negative results. Mutagenicity studies have not been performed with iodoquinol.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is also not known whether this product can affect reproduction capacity or cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. This product should be used by a pregnant woman only if clearly needed or when potential benefits outweigh potential hazards to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when this product is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following local adverse reactions are reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infections, skin atrophy, striae and miliaria.</p><h2>Hydrocortisone Iodoquinol Cream Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Apply to affected area 3 to 4 times daily in accordance with physician's directions.</p><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F), excursions permitted between 15°C to 30°C (between 59°F to 86°F). Brief exposure to temperatures up to 40°C (104°F) may be tolerated provided the mean kinetic temperature does not exceed 25°C (77°F); however, such exposure should be minimized. Keep container tightly closed.</p><h3>NOTICE</h3><p class="First">Protect from freezing and excessive heat.</p><h2>How is Hydrocortisone Iodoquinol Cream Supplied</h2><p class="First">1 oz. tubes, NDC 69367-286-01</p><p><span class="Bold">To report</span> a serious adverse event or obtain product information, call 1-844-221-7294.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Manufactured for:</span></p><p>Westminster Pharmaceuticals, LLC</p><p>Nashville, TN 37217</p><p>Rev. 08/20</p><h2>PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL - 28.4 g Tube Carton</h2><p class="First">NDC 69367-286-01<br/>
