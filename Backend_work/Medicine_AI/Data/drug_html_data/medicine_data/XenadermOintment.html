PAT. NO. 6,479,060</p><p><span class="Bold">ACTIVE INGREDIENTS:</span> Each gram contains Trypsin USP NLT 90 USP units, Balsam Peru 87.0 mg, Castor Oil USP/NF 788.0 mg.</p><p><span class="Bold">INACTIVE INGREDIENTS:</span> Safflower Oil, Aluminum Magnesium Hydroxide Stearate.</p><p><span class="Bold">ACTION:</span> Balsam Peru is an effective capillary bed stimulant used to increase circulation in the wound site area. Also, Balsam Peru has a mildly bactericidal action. Castor Oil is used to improve epithelialization by reducing premature epithelial desiccation and cornification. Also, it can act as a protective covering and aids in the reduction of pain. Trypsin is intended for drebridement of eschar and other necrotic tissue. It appears that in many instances removal of wound debris strengthens humoral defense mechanisms sufficiently to retard proliferation of local pathogens.</p><ul>
