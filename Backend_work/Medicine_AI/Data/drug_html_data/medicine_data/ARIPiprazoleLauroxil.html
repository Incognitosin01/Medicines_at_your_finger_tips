Following intramuscular injection, aripiprazole lauroxil is likely converted by enzyme-mediated hydrolysis to N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole, which is then hydrolyzed to aripiprazole. Aripiprazole is a quinolinone antipsychotic that exhibits high affinity for D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors; moderate affinity for D<sub>4</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, 5-HT<sub>7</sub>, alpha<sub>1</sub> adrenergic, and H<sub>1</sub> receptors. It also possesses moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake transporter; has no affinity for muscarinic (cholinergic) receptors. Aripiprazole functions as a partial agonist at the D<sub>2</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, and as an antagonist at the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (de Bartolomeis 2015).</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>V<sub>d</sub>: 268 L.</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Prodrug; undergoes enzyme-mediated hydrolysis to N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole followed by enzyme-mediated hydrolysis to aripiprazole. Aripiprazole undergoes hepatic metabolism via CYP2D6, CYP3A4 (dehydro-aripiprazole metabolite has affinity for D<sub>2</sub> receptors similar to the parent drug and represents 40% of the parent drug exposure in plasma) (Sheehan 2010).</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>Aristada: 5 to 6 days following injection; within 4 days following injection when administered concomitantly with oral aripiprazole.</p><p>Aristada Initio (675 mg strength nanocrystal dispersion): Reaches systemic circulation on day of injection; reaches clinically relevant serum concentrations 4 days following injection when administered concomitantly with oral aripiprazole 30 mg.</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Serum: Aristada Initio (675 mg strength nanocrystal dispersion): 16 to 35 days (median 27 days).</p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>Aristada: 36 days following appearance in the systemic circulation.</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Aristada: 53.9 to 57.2 days.</p><p>Aristada Initio (675 mg strength nanocrystal dispersion): 15 to 18 days.</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>&gt;99%, primarily to albumin.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Schizophrenia:</b> Treatment of schizophrenia in adults.</p><p>Limitations of use: The <b>675 mg</b> strength aripiprazole lauroxil nanocrystal dispersion (Aristada Initio) is only to be used as a single dose in combination with oral aripiprazole for initiation of long-term treatment with aripiprazole lauroxil (Aristada) or as a single dose to reinitiate treatment after a missed dose of aripiprazole lauroxil (Aristada).

Generally, when discontinuing antipsychotic therapy for a chronic psychiatric disorder (eg, schizophrenia), decreasing the dose gradually over months with close monitoring may be appropriate and may enable clinicians to detect prodromal symptoms of disease recurrence (APA [Lehman 2004]; CPA 2005).</p><p><b>Switching antipsychotics:</b> An optimal, universal strategy for switching antipsychotic drugs has not been established. Strategies include: Cross-titration (gradually discontinuing the first antipsychotic while gradually increasing the new antipsychotic) and abrupt change (abruptly discontinuing the first antipsychotic and either increasing the new antipsychotic gradually or starting it at a treatment dose). In patients with schizophrenia at high risk of relapse, the current medication may be maintained at full dose as the new medication is increased (ie, overlap); once the new medication is at therapeutic dose, the first medication is gradually decreased and discontinued over 1 to 2 weeks (Cerovecki 2013; Remington 2005; Takeuchi 2017). Based upon clinical experience, some experts generally prefer cross-titration and overlap approaches rather than abrupt change (Post 2019; Stroup 2019).</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy: </b>Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IM: For IM administration only. Administer the 441 mg dose (Aristada) and the <b>675 mg</b> nanocrystal dispersion dose (Aristada Initio) in the deltoid or gluteal muscle, and other dose strengths (Aristada) in the gluteal muscle. Inject in a rapid and continuous manner. Avoid administering aripiprazole lauroxil nanocrystal dispersion (Aristada Initio) and aripiprazole lauroxil (Aristada) concurrently in the same muscle. Prior to administration, tap the syringe at least 10 times and then shake the syringe vigorously ≥30 seconds to ensure a uniform suspension. If the syringe is not used within 15 minutes, shake again for 30 seconds. Use the appropriate sized needle for the injection site; a 21-gauge, 1 inch or 20-gauge, 1.5-inch needle for deltoid injection and a 20-gauge, 1.5- or 2-inch needle for gluteal injection. Use the longer needles for patients with a larger amount of subcutaneous tissue overlaying the injection site muscle.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Abametapir: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors).<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors (Central): May enhance the neurotoxic (central) effect of Antipsychotic Agents.

Aripiprazole lauroxil is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Altered cardiac conduction: May alter cardiac conduction; life-threatening arrhythmias have occurred with therapeutic doses of antipsychotics.</p><p>• Blood dyscrasias: Leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis (sometimes fatal) have been reported in clinical trials and postmarketing reports with antipsychotic use; presence of risk factors (eg, preexisting low WBC/ANC or history of drug-induced leuko-/neutropenia) should prompt periodic blood count assessment. Discontinue therapy at first signs of blood dyscrasias or if absolute neutrophil count &lt;1,000/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>• Cerebrovascular effects: An increased incidence of cerebrovascular effects (eg, transient ischemic attack, stroke), including fatalities, has been reported in placebo-controlled trials of antipsychotics for the unapproved use in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis.</p><p>• CNS depression: May cause CNS depression, which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks that require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery, driving).</p><p>• Dyslipidemia: Lipid changes, including increases in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides and decreases in HDL cholesterol, have been reported; risk profile may differ between antipsychotic agents. Compared to other antipsychotics, the risk of dyslipidemia with aripiprazole lauroxil is minimal-to-low (Solmi 2017).</p><p>• Esophageal dysmotility/aspiration: Antipsychotic use has been associated with esophageal dysmotility and aspiration; risk increases with age. Use with caution in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia (eg, Alzheimer disease), particularly in patients &gt;75 years (Herzig 2017; Maddalena 2004).</p><p>• Extrapyramidal symptoms: May cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), including pseudoparkinsonism, acute dystonic reactions, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia (risk of these reactions is generally much lower relative to typical/conventional antipsychotics; frequencies reported are similar to placebo). Risk of dystonia (and probably other EPS) may be greater with increased doses, use of conventional antipsychotics, males, and younger patients. Factors associated with greater vulnerability to tardive dyskinesia include older in age, female gender combined with postmenopausal status, Parkinson disease, pseudoparkinsonism symptoms, affective disorders (particularly major depressive disorder), concurrent medical diseases such as diabetes, previous brain damage, alcoholism, poor treatment response, and use of high doses of antipsychotics (APA [Lehman 2004]; Soares-Weiser 2007). Consider therapy discontinuation with signs/symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.</p><p>• Falls: May increase the risk for falls due to somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, and motor or sensory instability.</p><p>• Hyperglycemia: Atypical antipsychotics have been associated with development of hyperglycemia; in some cases, may be extreme and associated with ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death. All patients should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia (eg, polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, weakness). Use with caution in patients with diabetes or other disorders of glucose regulation; monitor for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes (eg, obesity or family history) should have a baseline fasting blood sugar and periodic assessment of glucose regulation. Hyperglycemia may resolve with discontinuation of therapy; however, some patients may require treatment of diabetes after discontinuation of therapy. Compared to other antipsychotics, the risk of hyperglycemia with aripiprazole lauroxil is minimal-to-low (Solmi 2017).</p><p>• Impulse control disorders: Has been associated with compulsive behaviors and/or loss of impulse control, which has manifested as pathological gambling, uncontrolled sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges. Patients with prior history of impulse control issues may be at increased risk. Dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy has been reported to reverse these behaviors in most, but not all, cases (Gaboriau 2014; Moore 2014; Smith 2011).</p><p>• Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: Use may be associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome; monitor for mental status changes, fever, muscle rigidity and/or autonomic instability.</p><p>• Orthostatic hypotension: May cause orthostatic hypotension; increased risk at initiation of therapy or during dose escalation. Use with caution in patients at risk of this effect or in those who would not tolerate transient hypotensive episodes (cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, hypovolemia, or concurrent medication use which may predispose to hypotension/bradycardia). Consider using lower starting dosages and slower titrations in these patients.</p><p>• Temperature regulation: Impaired core body temperature regulation may occur; caution with strenuous exercise, heat exposure, dehydration, and concomitant medication possessing anticholinergic effects.</p><p>• Weight gain: Significant weight gain has been observed with antipsychotic therapy; incidence varies with product. Monitoring of weight is recommended. Compared to other antipsychotics, the risk of weight gain with aripiprazole lauroxil is minimal (Solmi 2017).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiac disease, cerebrovascular disease, prior myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, or conditions which predispose to hypotension.</p><p>• Dementia: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotics are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</b> Most deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (eg, heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (eg, pneumonia) in nature. Use with caution in patients with Lewy body dementia or Parkinson disease dementia due to greater risk of adverse effects, increased sensitivity to extrapyramidal effects, and association with irreversible cognitive decompensation or death (APA [Reus 2016]). <b>Aripiprazole lauroxil is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.</b></p><p>• Parkinson disease: Use with caution in patients with Parkinson disease; antipsychotics may aggravate motor disturbances (APA [Lehman 2004; Reus 2016]).</p><p>• Seizures: Use with caution in patients at risk of seizures, including those with a history of seizures, head trauma, brain damage, alcoholism, or concurrent therapy with medications which may lower seizure threshold. Elderly patients may be at increased risk of seizures due to an increased prevalence of predisposing factors.</p><p><b><i><b><i>Special populations</i></b>:</i></b></p><p>• CYP2D6 poor metabolizers: Known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may be at risk for elevated aripiprazole concentrations. Avoid use of the <b>675 mg</b> strength aripiprazole lauroxil nanocrystal dispersion (Aristada Initio) in this population; dose adjustment is required with other strengths of aripiprazole lauroxil (Aristada).</p><p><b><i><b><i>Other warnings/precautions</i></b>:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, could occur between the <b>675 mg</b> strength aripiprazole lauroxil nanocrystal dispersion (Aristada Initio) and other aripiprazole lauroxil strengths (Aristada). The <b>675 mg</b> strength nanocrystal dispersion (Aristada Initio) is not intended for repeat dosing, and is only used as a single dose in combination with oral aripiprazole for initiation of long-term treatment with intramuscular aripiprazole lauroxil (Aristada) or as a single dose to reinitiate treatment after a missed dose of intramuscular aripiprazole lauroxil (Aristada). The <b>675 mg</b> strength aripiprazole lauroxil nanocrystal dispersion (Aristada Initio) is not interchangeable with other aripiprazole lauroxil strengths (Aristada).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Mental status; vital signs (as clinically indicated); blood pressure (baseline; repeat 3 months after antipsychotic initiation, then yearly); weight, height, BMI, waist circumference (baseline; repeat at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after initiating or changing therapy, then quarterly; consider switching to a different antipsychotic for a weight gain ≥5% of initial weight); CBC (as clinically indicated; monitor frequently during the first few months of therapy in patients with preexisting low WBC or history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia); electrolytes and liver function (annually and as clinically indicated); personal and family history of obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease (baseline; repeat annually); fasting plasma glucose level/HbA<sub>1c</sub> (baseline; repeat 3 months after starting antipsychotic, then yearly); fasting lipid panel (baseline; repeat 3 months after initiation of antipsychotic; if LDL level is normal repeat at 2- to 5-year intervals or more frequently if clinical indicated); changes in menstruation, libido, development of galactorrhea, erectile and ejaculatory function (yearly); abnormal involuntary movements or parkinsonian signs (baseline; repeat weekly until dose stabilized for at least 2 weeks after introduction and for 2 weeks after any significant dose increase); tardive dyskinesia (every 12 months; high-risk patients every 6 months); ocular examination (yearly in patients &gt;40 years; every 2 years in younger patients) (ADA 2004; Lehman 2004; Marder 2004); fall risk (baseline and periodically during treatment in patients with diseases or on medications that may also increase fall risk).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Aripiprazole crosses the placenta; aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole can be detected in the cord blood at delivery (Nguyen 2011; Watanabe 2011).</p><p>Antipsychotic use during the third trimester of pregnancy has a risk for abnormal muscle movements (extrapyramidal symptoms [EPS]) and/or withdrawal symptoms in newborns following delivery.
