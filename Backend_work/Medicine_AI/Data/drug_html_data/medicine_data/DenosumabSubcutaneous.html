This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For denosumab, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to denosumab or any other medicines.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Use of denosumab injection is not recommended in the pediatric population, except for teenagers with giant cell tumor of the bone. The safety and efficacy of denosumab for other conditions have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of denosumab injection in the elderly.
