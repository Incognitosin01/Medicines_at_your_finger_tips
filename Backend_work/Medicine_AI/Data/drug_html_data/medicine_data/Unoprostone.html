Cardiovascular and pulmonary function were not affected in clinical studies. IOP was decreased by 3-4 mm Hg in patients with a mean baseline IOP of 23 mm Hg. IOP may also be lowered by increased trabecular meshwork outflow via stimulation of calcium-activated BK and CIC-2 type channels (Fung, 2014).</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Through cornea and conjunctival epithelium (minimal systemic exposure)</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Hydrolyzed by esterases unoprostone-free acid</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (as metabolites)</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>14 minutes</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension:</b> To lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to unoprostone or any component of the formulation </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension:</b> Ophthalmic: Instill 1 drop into affected eye(s) twice daily</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>May be used with other eye drops to lower intraocular pressure; if using more than one product, wait at least 5 minutes between application of each medication. Remove contact lenses prior to administration and wait 15 minutes before reinserting. Minimize contamination by not touching the eyelids or surrounding areas with the dropper tip; keep bottle tightly closed when not in use. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store between 2°C to 25°C (36°F to 77°F).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Prostaglandins (Ophthalmic).

May also cause pigment changes to periorbital tissues and eyelashes during use; reversible upon discontinuation in most patients.</p><p>• Infection: Bacterial keratitis, caused by inadvertent contamination of multiple-dose ophthalmic solutions, has been reported. Minimize contamination by not touching the eyelids or surrounding areas with the dropper tip; keep bottle tightly closed when not in use. </p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Ocular disease: Use with caution in patients with intraocular inflammation (eg, uveitis); may exacerbate intraocular inflammatory conditions. May cause macular edema, including cystoid macular edema; use cautiously in aphakic patients, pseudophakic patients with torn posterior lens capsules, or in patients at risk for macular edema. </p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Contact lens wearers: Contains benzalkonium chloride which may be adsorbed by contact lenses; remove contacts prior to administration and wait 15 minutes before reinserting. </p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Contains benzalkonium chloride 0.015% as a preservative.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
C

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>In animal reproduction studies, adverse events were observed when administered subcutaneously at doses greater than the recommended human dose. Following ophthalmic administration, systemic absorption is minimal; systemic absorption would be required in order for unoprostone to cross the placenta and reach the fetus. If ophthalmic agents are needed during pregnancy, the minimum effective dose should be used in combination with punctal occlusion to decrease potential exposure to the fetus (Samples, 1988).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat glaucoma.</p><p>• It is used to lower high eye pressure.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
