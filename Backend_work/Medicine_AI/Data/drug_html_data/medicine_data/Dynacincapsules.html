</ul><h2>Dynacin Description</h2><p class="First">Minocycline hydrochloride, a semisynthetic derivative of tetracycline, is 4,7-Bis(dimethylamino)-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12a-octahydro-3,10,12,12a-tetrahydroxy-1,11-dioxo-2-naphthacenecarboxamide monohydrochloride. The structural formula is represented below:</p><p>C<span class="Sub">23</span>H<span class="Sub">27</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">7</span>.HCl                                                                                                                          M. W. 493.94</p><p>Each minocycline hydrochloride capsule, for oral administration, contains the equivalent of 50 mg, 75 mg or 100 mg of minocycline. In addition each capsule contains the following inactive ingredients: magnesium stearate and starch (corn).</p><p>The 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg capsule shells contain: gelatin, silicon dioxide, sodium lauryl sulfate and titanium dioxide.</p><p>The 75 mg and 100 mg capsule shells also contain: black iron oxide.</p><h2>Dynacin - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Following oral administration of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is rapid. Maximum serum concentrations following a single dose of minocycline hydrochloride to normal fasting adult volunteers were attained in 1 to 4 hours. The serum half-life in normal volunteers ranges from approximately 11 hours to 22 hours.</p><p>When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a meal which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was not noticeably influenced. The peak plasma concentrations were slightly decreased and delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions.</p><p>In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers is one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracyclines is common.</p><p>Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections as described in the <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span> section:</p><p>AEROBIC GRAM-POSITIVE MICROORGANISMS</p><p>Because many strains of the following gram-positive microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility testing are especially recommended. Tetracycline antibiotics should not be used for streptococcal diseases unless the organism has been demonstrated to be susceptible. Tetracyclines are not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.</p><p>AEROBIC GRAM-NEGATIVE MICROORGANISMS</p><p>Because many strains of the following groups of gram-negative microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility tests are especially recommended:</p><p>"OTHER" MICROORGANISMS</p><p><span class="Sup">†</span>When penicillin is contraindicated, tetracyclines are alternative drugs in the treatment of infections caused by the cited microorganisms.</p><h3>Susceptibility tests</h3><p class="First">Susceptibility testing should be performed with tetracycline since it predicts susceptibility to minocycline. However, certain organisms (e.g., some staphylococci, and <span class="Italics">Acinetobacter</span> ssp.) may be more susceptible to minocycline and doxycycline than to tetracycline.</p><p class="First">Dilution techniques</p><p>Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method<span class="Sup">1,3</span> (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tetracycline powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:</p><p class="First">For testing aerobic gram-negative microorganisms (Enterobacteriaceae), <span class="Italics">Acinetobacter</span> ssp. and <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span>.</p><p>For testing <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span><span class="Sup">a</span> and <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span><span class="Sup">b</span>:</p><p><span class="Sup">a</span> These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing with <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span> using Haemophilus Test Medium. <span class="Sup">1</span></p><p><span class="Sup">b</span> These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing using cation-adjusted Muller-Hinton broth with 2 – 5% lysed horse blood. <span class="Sup">1</span></p><p class="First">For testing <span class="Italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span><span class="Sup">c</span>.</p><p><span class="Sup">c</span> These interpretative standards are applicable only to agar dilution susceptibility testing using GC agar base and 1% defined growth supplements. <span class="Sup">1</span></p><p class="First">A report of "Susceptible" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of "Intermediate" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of "Resistant" indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.</p><p>Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard tetracycline powder should provide the following MIC values:</p><p class="First">Diffusion techniques</p><p>Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure<span class="Sup">2,3</span> requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30µg tetracycline (class disk) <span class="Italics">or</span> 30µg minocycline to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to minocycline. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30µg tetracycline or minocycline disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:</p><p>For testing aerobic gram-negative microorganisms (Enterobacteriaceae) <span class="Italics">Acinetobacter</span> ssp. and <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span>:</p><p>For testing <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span><span class="Sup">d</span>:</p><p><span class="Sup">d</span> These zone diameter standards are applicable only to susceptibility testing with <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span> using Haemophilus Test Medium and a 30µg tetracycline disk.<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">For testing <span class="Italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span><span class="Sup">e</span>:</p><p><span class="Sup">e</span> These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using GC agar and 1% growth supplements, and a 30µg tetracycline disk.<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">For testing <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span><span class="Sup">f</span>:</p><p><span class="Sup">f</span> These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using Muller-Hinton agar adjusted with 5% sheep blood and a 30µg tetracycline disk.<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">For testing <span class="Italics">Vibrio cholerae</span><span class="Sup">g</span>:</p><p><span class="Sup">g</span> These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing performed with a 30µg tetracycline disk.<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for tetracycline.</p><p>As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 30µg tetracycline or minocycline disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains:</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Dynacin</h2><p class="First">Minocycline Hydrochloride Capsules are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms:</p><p>Minocycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms, when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug:</p><p>Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug:</p><p>When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections:</p><p>In <span class="Italics">acute intestinal amebiasis</span>, minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides.</p><p>In severe <span class="Italics">acne</span>, minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy.</p><p>Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of <span class="Italics">Neisseria</span> <span class="Italics">meningitidis</span> to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high.</p><p><span class="Italics">Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection.</span></p><p>Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium</span> <span class="Italics">marinum.</span></p><p>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS ANTIBIOTICS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN).</p><p>This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED.</p><p>All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued.</p><p>Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy.</p><p>The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable.</p><p>Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline.</p><p>Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><p>Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. The usual clinical manifestations are headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. While both of these conditions and related symptoms usually resolve after discontinuation of tetracycline, the possibility for permanent sequelae exists.</p><p>Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated.</p><p>Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</h3><p class="First">Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported rarely with use of minocycline.</p><p>Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>) should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy.</p><p>Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective (see <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span>).</p><p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic studies should be performed.</p><p>All patients with gonorrhea should have a serologic test for syphilis at the time of diagnosis. Patients treated with minocycline should have a follow-up serologic test for syphilis after 3 months.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.</p><p>Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin.</p><p>Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.</p><p>The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.</p><p>Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective.</p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">(See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>)</p><p class="First">(See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>)</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">(See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.)</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Due to oral minocycline's virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal</h3><p class="First">Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, pancreatitus, inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region, and increases in liver enzymes have been reported. Rarely, hepatitis and liver failure have been reported. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and the parenteral administration of tetracyclines. Rare instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients taking the tetracycline-class antibiotics in capsule and tablet form. Most of these patients took the medication immediately before going to bed (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h3>Skin</h3><p class="First">Maculopapular and erythematous rashes. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported but is uncommon. Fixed drug eruptions have been rarely reported. Lesions occurring on the glans penis have caused balanitis. Erythema multiforme and rarely Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. Photosensitivity is discussed above (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). Pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes has been reported.</p><h3>Renal toxicity</h3><p class="First">Elevations in BUN have been reported and are apparently dose related (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). Acute renal failure has been rarely reported and, in most cases, has been reversible.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity reactions</h3><p class="First">Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, polyarthralgia, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus and rarely pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia have been reported. A lupus-like syndrome and serum sickness-like reactions also have been reported.</p><h3>Blood</h3><p class="First">Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported.</p><h3>Central Nervous System</h3><p class="First">Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) in adults (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS-General</span>) have been reported. Headache has also been reported.</p><h3>Other</h3><p class="First">When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid glands. Very rare cases of abnormal thyroid function have been reported.</p><p>Tooth discoloration in pediatric patients less than 8 years of age (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>) and also, rarely, in adults has been reported.</p><p>Tinnitus and decreased hearing have been rarely reported in patients on minocycline hydrochloride.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures. Minocycline is not removed in significant quantities by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.</p><h2>Dynacin Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS.</p><p>Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food. (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>.)</p><h3>For Pediatric Patients Above 8 Years of Age</h3><p class="First">The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours.</p><h3>Adults</h3><p class="First">The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours.
