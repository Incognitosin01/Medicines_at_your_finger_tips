Each tablet contains 90 mg ledipasvir and 400 mg sofosbuvir.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">If ledipasvir and sofosbuvir is administered with ribavirin, the contraindications to ribavirin also apply to this combination regimen. Refer to the ribavirin prescribing information for a list of contraindications for ribavirin <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Risk of Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation in Patients Coinfected with HCV and HBV</h3><p class="First">Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct acting antivirals, and who were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Cases have been reported in patients who are HBsAg positive and also in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection (i.e., HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive). HBV reactivation has also been reported in patients receiving certain immunosuppressants or chemotherapeutic agents; the risk of HBV reactivation associated with treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals may be increased in these patients.</p><p>HBV reactivation is characterized as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level. In patients with resolved HBV infection, reappearance of HBsAg can occur. Reactivation of HBV replication may be accompanied by hepatitis, i.e., increases in aminotransferase levels and, in severe cases, increases in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur.</p><p>Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating HCV treatment with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. In patients with serologic evidence of HBV infection, monitor for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir and during post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone</h3><p class="First">Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, as well as fatal cardiac arrest and cases requiring pacemaker intervention, have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease, may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.</p><p>Coadministration of amiodarone with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative, viable treatment options and who will be coadministered ledipasvir and sofosbuvir:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia</li>
<li>Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment.</li>
</ul><p>Patients who are taking ledipasvir and sofosbuvir who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative, viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.</p><p>Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting ledipasvir and sofosbuvir should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.</p><p>Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion, or memory problems <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Use with P-gp Inducers</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir and P-gp inducers may significantly decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced therapeutic effect of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. Therefore, the use of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Risks Associated with Ribavirin Combination Treatment</h3><p class="First">If ledipasvir and sofosbuvir is administered with ribavirin, the warnings and precautions for ribavirin, in particular the pregnancy avoidance warning, apply to this combination regimen. Refer to the ribavirin prescribing information for a full list of the warnings and precautions for ribavirin <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

The side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs.</p><p>The safety assessment of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir was also based on pooled data from three open-label trials (Study 1119, ION-4, and ELECTRON-2) in 118 subjects with chronic HCV genotype 4, 5, or 6 infection with compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>. The subjects received Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) once daily by mouth for 12 weeks. The safety profile in subjects with chronic HCV genotype 4, 5, or 6 infection with compensated liver disease was similar to that observed in subjects with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection with compensated liver disease.

Table 5 presents the adverse reactions, as defined above, that occurred with at least 5% greater frequency in subjects treated with 24 weeks of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir or 12 weeks of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir + ribavirin, compared to those reported for 12 weeks of placebo. The majority of the adverse reactions presented in Table 5 were Grade 1 or 2 in severity.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Subjects Coinfected with HIV-1</span></p><p>The safety assessment of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir was based on an open-label clinical trial in 335 genotype 1 or 4 subjects with HCV/HIV-1 coinfection who were on stable antiretroviral therapy in Study ION-4 <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.4)]</span>. The safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected subjects was similar to that observed in HCV mono-infected subjects. The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of subjects were headache (20%) and fatigue (17%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Liver Transplant Recipients and/or Subjects with Decompensated Cirrhosis</span></p><p>The safety assessment of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir with ribavirin in liver transplant recipients and/or those who had decompensated liver disease was based on pooled data from two Phase 2 open-label clinical trials including 336 subjects who received Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) plus ribavirin for 12 weeks. Subjects with Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) scores greater than 12 were excluded from the trials <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.5)]</span>.</p><p>The adverse events observed were consistent with the expected clinical sequelae of liver transplantation and/or decompensated liver disease, or the known safety profile of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir and/or ribavirin.</p><p>Decreases in hemoglobin to less than 10 g/dL and 8.5 g/dL during treatment were observed in 38% and 13% of subjects treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks, respectively. Ribavirin was permanently discontinued in 11% of subjects treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Liver Transplant Recipients with Compensated Liver Disease:</span></p><p>Among the 174 liver transplant recipients with compensated liver disease who received Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) with ribavirin for 12 weeks, 2 (1%) subjects permanently discontinued ledipasvir and sofosbuvir due to an adverse event.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Subjects with Decompensated Liver Disease:</span></p><p>Among the 162 subjects with decompensated liver disease (pre- or post-transplant) who received Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) with ribavirin for 12 weeks, 7 (4%) subjects died, 4 (2%) subjects underwent liver transplantation, and 1 subject (&lt;1%) underwent liver transplantation and died during treatment or within 30 days after discontinuation of treatment. Because these events occurred in patients with advanced liver disease who are at risk of progression of liver disease including liver failure and death, it is not possible to reliably assess the contribution of drug effect to outcomes. A total of 4 (2%) subjects permanently discontinued ledipasvir and sofosbuvir due to an adverse event.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Less Common Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials (less than 5%):</span> The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 5% of subjects receiving Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) in any one trial. These events have been included because of their seriousness or assessment of potential causal relationship.</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric disorders:</span> depression (including in subjects with pre-existing history of psychiatric illness).</p><p>Depression (particularly in subjects with pre-existing history of psychiatric illness) occurred in subjects receiving sofosbuvir containing regimens. Suicidal ideation and suicide have occurred in less than 1% of subjects treated with sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin or pegylated interferon/ribavirin in other clinical trials.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Laboratory Abnormalities</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Bilirubin Elevations:</span> Bilirubin elevations of greater than 1.5×ULN were observed in 3%, less than 1%, and 2% of subjects treated with Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively. Bilirubin elevations of greater than 1.5×ULN were observed in 3%, 11%, and 3% of subjects with compensated cirrhosis treated with placebo, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12 weeks, and ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 24 weeks, respectively, in the SIRIUS trial.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Lipase Elevations:</span> Transient, asymptomatic lipase elevations of greater than 3×ULN were observed in less than 1%, 2%, and 3% of subjects treated with Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively. Transient, asymptomatic lipase elevations of greater than 3×ULN were observed in 1%, 3%, and 9% of subjects with compensated cirrhosis treated with placebo, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12 weeks, and ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 24 weeks, respectively, in the SIRIUS trial.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Creatine Kinase:</span> Creatine kinase was not assessed in Phase 3 trials ION-3, ION-1, or ION-2 of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. Creatine kinase was assessed in the ION-4 trial. Isolated, asymptomatic creatine kinase elevations of greater than or equal to 10×ULN was observed in 1% of subjects treated with Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) for 12 weeks in the ION-4 trial and has also been previously reported in subjects treated with sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin or peginterferon/ribavirin in other clinical trials.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Adults with Severe Renal Impairment, Including those on Dialysis</span></p><p>In an open-label trial (Trial 0154) in which adults with HCV with compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis) and severe renal impairment received Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) for 12 weeks (N=18), the most common adverse reaction was fatigue (17%) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.6)].</span></p><p>In an open-label clinical trial, Trial 4063, a total of 95 adults with HCV with compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis) and ESRD requiring dialysis received Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) for 8 (n=45), 12 (n=31), or 24 (n=19) weeks. The most common adverse reactions were insomnia and headache (each reported in 4% of subjects overall) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.6)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects 3 Years of Age and Older</span></p><p>The safety assessment of Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg), ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (HARVONI) tablets (45 mg/200 mg), or ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (HARVONI) oral pellets in pediatric subjects 3 years of age and older is based on data from a Phase 2, open-label clinical trial (Study 1116). In total, 226 subjects were enrolled, which included 223 subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis who were treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks; one genotype 1 treatment-experienced subject with cirrhosis who was treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 24 weeks; and two genotype 3 subjects who were treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 24 weeks. The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical studies of Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) in adults. Limited safety data are available in pediatric subjects receiving ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 24 weeks. No Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions or discontinuation due to an adverse reaction was observed in those pediatric subjects receiving ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 24 weeks <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.7)]</span>.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir.

Angioedema</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Potential for Drug Interaction</h3><p class="First">Any interactions that have been identified with ledipasvir or sofosbuvir individually may occur with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir.</p><p>After oral administration of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir is rapidly absorbed and subject to extensive first-pass hepatic extraction. In clinical pharmacology studies, both sofosbuvir and the inactive metabolite GS-331007 were monitored for purposes of pharmacokinetic analyses.</p><p>Ledipasvir is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and may increase intestinal absorption of coadministered substrates for these transporters.</p><p>Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 is not. P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) may decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, and the use with P-gp inducers is not recommended with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Established and Potentially Significant Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Clearance of HCV infection with direct acting antivirals may lead to changes in hepatic function, which may impact the safe and effective use of concomitant medications. For example, altered blood glucose control resulting in serious symptomatic hypoglycemia has been reported in diabetic patients in postmarketing case reports and published epidemiological studies. Management of hypoglycemia in these cases required either discontinuation or dose modification of concomitant medications used for diabetes treatment.</p><p>Frequent monitoring of relevant laboratory parameters (e.g., International Normalized Ratio [INR] in patients taking warfarin, blood glucose levels in diabetic patients) or drug concentrations of concomitant medications such as cytochrome P450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., certain immunosuppressants) is recommended to ensure safe and effective use. Dose adjustments of concomitant medications may be necessary.</p><p>Table 6 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with either Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) or ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as individual agents, or are predicted drug interactions that may occur with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><ul>

Trial results in the genotype 4, 5, and 6 HCV populations are based upon limited number of subjects in some subgroups, particularly in subjects who have been previously treated and subjects with cirrhosis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Genotype 4</span></p><p>In two open-label studies (Study 1119 and ION-4), Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) were administered for 12 weeks to treatment-naïve and previously-treated adult subjects with genotype 4 HCV infection. Study 1119 enrolled 44 treatment-naïve or previously-treated subjects with genotype 4 HCV, with or without cirrhosis. ION-4 enrolled 4 treatment-naïve and 4 previously-treated subjects with genotype 4 HCV infection who were coinfected with HIV-1, none of whom had cirrhosis.</p><p>In Study 1119, the overall SVR12 rate was 93% (41/44). SVR12 was similar based upon prior HCV treatment history and cirrhosis status. In ION-4, all 8 subjects achieved SVR12.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Genotype 5</span></p><p>In the open-label 1119 trial, Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) were administered for 12 weeks to 41 treatment-naïve or previously treated adult subjects with genotype 5 HCV infection, with or without cirrhosis. The overall SVR12 was 93% (38/41). SVR12 was similar based upon prior HCV treatment history and cirrhosis status.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Genotype 6</span></p><p>In the open-label ELECTRON-2 trial, Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) were administered for 12 weeks to 25 treatment-naïve or previously treated adult subjects with genotype 6 HCV infection, with or without cirrhosis. The overall SVR12 was 96% (24/25). SVR12 was similar based upon prior HCV treatment history and cirrhosis status. The single subject who relapsed discontinued study treatment early (at approximately Week 8).</p><h3>Clinical Trials in Subjects Coinfected with HCV and HIV-1</h3><p class="First">ION-4 was an open-label clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment with Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) without ribavirin in HCV treatment-naïve and previously treated adult subjects with genotype 1 or 4 HCV infection who were coinfected with HIV-1. Treatment-experienced subjects had failed prior treatment with Peg-IFN + ribavirin, Peg-IFN + ribavirin + an HCV protease inhibitor, or sofosbuvir + ribavirin. Subjects were on a stable HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy that included emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, administered with efavirenz, rilpivirine, or raltegravir.</p><p>Of the 335 treated subjects, the median age was 52 years (range: 26 to 72); 82% of the subjects were male; 61% were White; 34% were Black; mean body mass index was 27 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (range: 18 to 66 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>); 75% had genotype 1a HCV infection; 2% had genotype 4 infection; 76% had non-C/C IL28B alleles (CT or TT); and 20% had compensated cirrhosis. Fifty-five percent (55%) of the subjects were treatment-experienced.</p><p>Table 18 presents the SVR12 in the ION-4 trial after 12 weeks of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir treatment.</p><p>SVR12 rates were 94% (63/67) in subjects with cirrhosis and 98% (46/47) in subjects who were previously treated and had cirrhosis. The relapse rate in the ION-4 trial in Black subjects was 9% (10/115), all of whom were IL28B non-CC genotype, and none in non-Black subjects (0/220). In the ION-1, ION-2, and ION-3 HCV mono-infection studies, relapse rates were 3% (10/305) in Black subjects and 2% (26/1637) in non-Black subjects.</p><p>No subject had HIV-1 rebound during the study. The percentage of CD4+ cells did not change during treatment. Median CD4+ cell count increase of 29 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> was observed at the end of treatment with Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets for 12 weeks.</p><h3>Clinical Trials in Liver Transplant Recipients and/or Subjects with Decompensated Cirrhosis</h3><p class="First">SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 were two open-label trials that evaluated 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) in combination with ribavirin in HCV treatment-naïve and previously treated adult subjects with genotype 1 and 4 infection who had undergone liver transplantation and/or who had decompensated liver disease. The two trials were identical in study design. Subjects were enrolled in one of the seven groups in the trials based on liver transplantation status and severity of hepatic impairment (see Table 19). Subjects with a CPT score greater than 12 were excluded. Within each group, subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive ledipasvir and sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12 weeks or ledipasvir and sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 24 weeks. For subjects with decompensated cirrhosis in SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 studies, the starting ribavirin dosage was 600 mg per day regardless of transplantation status. Ribavirin dose adjustments were performed according to the ribavirin labeling <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>.</p><p>Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across the treatment groups. Of the 670 treated subjects, the median age was 59 years (range: 21 to 81); 77% of the subjects were male; 91% were White; mean body mass index was 28 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (range: 18 to 49 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>); 94% and 6% had genotype 1 and 4 HCV infection, respectively; 78% of the subjects failed a prior HCV therapy.</p><p>Table 19 presents the pooled SVR12 rates for SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 in subjects with genotype 1 HCV treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12 weeks. The SVR12 rates observed with 24 weeks of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir + ribavirin were similar to the SVR12 rates observed with 12 weeks of treatment. Therefore, the results for the ledipasvir and sofosbuvir + ribavirin 24 weeks arm are not presented in Table 19.</p><p>There were 7 subjects with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis in the 12-week treatment arm, and all subjects achieved SVR12.</p><p>In genotype 4 HCV post-transplant subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12 weeks (N=12), the SVR12 rate was similar to rates reported with genotype 1; no subjects relapsed. Available data in subjects with genotype 4 HCV who had decompensated cirrhosis (pre- and post-liver transplantation) were insufficient for dosing recommendations; therefore, these results are not presented.</p><h3>Clinical Trials in Adults with Severe Renal Impairment, Including those Requiring Dialysis</h3><p class="First">Trial 0154 was an open-label clinical trial that evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir Tablets (90 mg/400 mg) in 18 treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced (subjects with prior exposure to an HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor were excluded) genotype 1 HCV-infected adults with severe renal impairment not requiring dialysis. At baseline, two subjects (11%) had cirrhosis and the mean eGFR was 24.9 mL/min (range: 9.0 to 39.6). The SVR rate was 100% (18/18).</p><p>As shown in the table below, Trial 4063 was an open-label three-arm clinical trial that evaluated 8, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir in a total of 63 adults with chronic HCV infection and ESRD requiring dialysis. Of the 63 subjects, 10% had cirrhosis, 24% were treatment-experienced, 95% were on hemodialysis, and 5% were on peritoneal dialysis; mean duration on dialysis was 12 years (range: 0.2 to 43 years). The SVR rates for the 8, 12, and 24 week ledipasvir and sofosbuvir treatment groups are shown in Table 20.</p><h3>Clinical Trial in Pediatric Subjects</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir was evaluated in an open-label trial (Study 1116) in 224 HCV treatment-naïve (N=186) and treatment-experienced (N=38) pediatric subjects 3 years of age or older. This study evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir once daily in genotype 1 (N=183) or genotype 4 (N=3) treatment-naive subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis; genotype 1 treatment-experienced subjects without cirrhosis (N=37); and evaluated 24 weeks of treatment with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir once daily in one genotype 1 subject who was both treatment-experienced and cirrhotic.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Subjects 12 Years to &lt;18 Years of Age:</span> Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir was evaluated in 100 subjects 12 years to &lt;18 years of age with HCV genotype 1 infection. Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced subjects (patients had failed an interferon based regimen with or without ribavirin). The median age was 15 years (range: 12 to 17); 63% of the subjects were female; 91% were White, 7% were Black, and 2% were Asian; 13% were Hispanic/Latino; mean body mass index was 23 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (range: 13.1 to 36.6 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>); mean weight was 61 kg (range 33 to 126 kg); 55% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000 IU/mL; 81% had genotype 1a HCV infection. One subject (treatment-naïve) had known compensated cirrhosis. The majority of subjects (84%) had been infected through vertical transmission.</p><p>The SVR12 rate was 98% overall (98% [78/80] in treatment-naïve subjects and 100% [20/20] in treatment-experienced subjects). No subject experienced on-treatment virologic failure or relapse. Two subjects were lost to follow-up.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Subjects 6 Years to &lt;12 Years of Age:</span> Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir was evaluated in 90 subjects 6 years to &lt;12 years of age with HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection.

Eighty-nine of the subjects (87 with genotype 1 HCV infection and 2 with genotype 4 HCV infection) were treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, 1 subject with genotype 1 HCV infection was treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 24 weeks. The median age was 9 years (range: 6 to 11); 59% of the subjects were male; 79% were White, 8% were Black, and 6% were Asian; 10% were Hispanic/Latino; mean body mass index was 18 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (range: 13 to 31kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>); mean weight was 33 kg (range 18 to 76 kg); 59% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000 IU/mL; 86% had genotype 1a HCV infection; 2 subjects (1 treatment-naïve, 1 treatment-experienced) had known compensated cirrhosis. The majority of subjects (97%) had been infected through vertical transmission.</p><p>The SVR12 rate was 99% (86/87) in subjects with genotype 1 HCV infection, and 100% (2/2) in subjects with genotype 4 HCV infection. The one genotype 1 subject treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 24 weeks also achieved SVR12. The one subject (genotype 1) who did not achieve SVR12 and relapsed had been treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Subjects 3 Years to &lt;6 Years of Age:</span> Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir was evaluated in 34 subjects 3 years to &lt;6 years of age with HCV genotype 1 (N = 33) or genotype 4 (N = 1) infection. All of the subjects were treatment-naïve and treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. The median age was 5 years (range: 3 to 5); 71% of the subjects were female; 79% were White, 3% were Black, and 6% were Asian; 18% were Hispanic/Latino; mean body mass index was 17 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (range: 13 to 25 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>); mean weight was 19 kg (range 11 to 34 kg); 56% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000 IU/mL; 82% had genotype 1a HCV infection; no subjects had known cirrhosis.
