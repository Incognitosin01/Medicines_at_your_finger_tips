Do not use sodium chloride for initial reconstitution (sodium chloride will cause precipitation). Do not mix with other nebulizer solutions.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Inhalation: Deliver via Respirgard II nebulizer until nebulizer is emptied (30-45 minutes). Administer at a flow rate of 5 to 7 L/minute from a 40 to 50 pound-per-square inch (PSI) oxygen or air source. A 40-50 PSI air compressor can be used alternatively, with a set flow rate at 5 to 7 L/minute or a set pressure of 22 to 25 PSI. Air compressors &lt;20 PSI should not be used. Use appropriate precautions to minimize exposure to healthcare personnel; refer to individual institutional policy.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store intact vials at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); protect from light.</p><p>The manufacturer recommends the use of freshly prepared solutions for inhalation; however, may be stored for up to 48 hours in the vial at room temperature if protected from light. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>There are no known significant interactions.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>&gt;5%:</p><p>Central nervous system: Fatigue (66%), dizziness (45%)</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Decreased appetite (50%)</p><p>Infection: Infection (15%)</p><p>Respiratory: Cough (1% to 63%), dyspnea (48%), wheezing (32%), bronchospasm (≤15%)</p><p>Miscellaneous: Fever (51%)</p><p>1% to 5%:</p><p>Cardiovascular: Chest pain</p><p>Central nervous system: Headache</p><p>Dermatologic: Night sweats</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, dysgeusia, nausea, oral candidiasis</p><p>Hematologic &amp; oncologic: Anemia</p><p>Infection: Herpes virus infection, herpes zoster, influenza</p><p>Respiratory: Pharyngitis (≤5%), bronchitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection</p><p>Miscellaneous: Night sweats</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Abscess (oral), abdominal cramps, andominal pain, acute pancreatitis, acute rhinitis, ageusia, amnesia, anaphylaxis, anxiety, arthralgia, asthma, bacterial pneumonia, blepharitis, blurred vision, body odor, bronchitis, cerebrovascular accident, chest congestion, chest tightness, colitis, confusion, conjunctivitis, constipation, contact lens intolerance, cyanosis, cytomegalovirus disease (including colitis and retinitis), cytopenia, depression, dermatitis, desquamation, diabetes mellitus, disuption of body temperature regulation, drowsiness, dry hair, dyspepsia, dyspnea, emotional lability, encephalitis (viral), eosinophilia, eosinophilic pneumonitis, erythema, esophageal candidiasis, esophagitis, eye pain, facial edema, flank pain, gag reflex, gastritis, gastric ulcer, gingivitis, gout, hallucination, hematochezia, hemianopia, hemoptysis, hepatic insufficiency, hepatitis, hepatomegaly, herpes virus infection (pharyngeal), hiatal hernia, histoplasmosis, hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hypersensitivity reaction, hypertension, hyperventilation, hypocalcemia, hypoesthesia, hypoglycemia, hypotension, hypothermia, hypoxia, increased blood urea nitrogen, increased bronchial secretions, increased serum creatinine, infection (mycoplasma), insomnia, interstitial pneumonitis, Kaposi's sarcoma, laryngitis, laryngospasm, lethargy, lower extremity edema, melena, meningitis (cryptococcal infection), myalgia, nasal congestion, nephritis, nervousness, neuralgia, neuropathy, neutropenia, oral herpes, oral mucosa ulcer, otitis, palpitations, pancreatitis, pancytopenia, paranoia, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, pleurisy, pneumothorax, pruritus, pulmonary disease, rales, renal failure, renal insufficiency, renal pain, rhinitis, seizure, sepsis (central venous line-related), serious infection (extrapulmonary pneumocystosis), SIADH, sialorrhea, skin rash, splenomegaly, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, ST segment changes on ECG, syncope, tachycardia, tachypnea, thrombocytopenia, tonsillitis, torsades de pointes, tremor, tuberculosis, unsteady gait, urinary incontinence, urticaria, vasodilation, vasculitis, ventricular tachycardia, vertigo, vomiting, xeroderma, xerostomia</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Asthma: Use inhalation formulation with caution in patients with asthma. May induce bronchospasm or cough, especially in patients with a smoking or asthma history (an inhaled bronchodilator prior to pentamidine may ameliorate symptoms).</p><p>• Pancreatitis: Use with caution in patients with a history of pancreatic disease or elevated amylase/lipase levels; acute pancreatitis (with fatality) has been reported. Discontinue inhalational pentamidine if signs/symptoms of acute pancreatitis occur. </p><p>• PCP: Acute PCP may develop despite aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis. Although rare, extrapulmonary PCP disease may occur and has been associated with aerosolized pentamidine. Use appropriate precautions to minimize exposure to healthcare personnel; refer to individual institutional policy.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Adverse effects: Injection: According to the manufacturer, extent and consequence of pentamidine accumulation following chronic inhalation therapy are not known. Patients receiving pentamidine inhalation should be closely monitored for the development of serious adverse reactions that have occurred in patients receiving parenteral pentamidine, including hypotension, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hepatic or renal dysfunction, ventricular tachycardia (eg, torsade de pointes), pancreatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hyperkalemia and abnormal ST segment of ECG.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Liver function tests, renal function tests, blood glucose, serum potassium and calcium, CBC and platelets</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
C

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>It is not known if clinically significant concentrations reach the fetus when administered via the aerosolized route. Information related to fetal outcomes following maternal use of pentamidine is limited. If administered via the aerosolized route, maternal serum concentrations are lower, minimizing the exposure to the fetus (Gates 1993; Nanda 1992; Sperling 1992). Concern regarding occupational exposure and theoretical risk to pregnant health care workers has been discussed in the literature. Pregnant health care workers should avoid aerosolized exposure if possible (Conover 1988; Ito 1994; Smaldone 1991).</p><p>Aerosolized pentamidine may be used as an alternative agent for the prophylaxis of <i>Pneumocystis</i> pneumonia (PCP) in pregnant females with HIV infection who either cannot tolerate the preferred therapy or who wish to avoid it during the first trimester of pregnancy (HHS [OI adult 2020]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to prevent <i>Pneumocystis jirovecii</i> pneumonia.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
