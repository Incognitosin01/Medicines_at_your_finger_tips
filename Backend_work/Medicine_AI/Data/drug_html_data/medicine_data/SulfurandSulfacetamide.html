In addition, contact dermatitis, reddening, and scaling of the skin may occur.</p><p>• Hepatic effects: Fatalities associated with severe reactions, including fulminant hepatic necrosis and jaundice, have occurred with sulfonamides (regardless of route).</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Skin rash or other reactions have occurred in patients with no prior history of sulfonamide hypersensitivity. Discontinue use at the first sign of hypersensitivity or rash.</p><p>• Sulfonamide ("sulfa") allergy: Traditionally, concerns for cross-reactivity have extended to all compounds containing the sulfonamide structure (SO<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>). An expanded understanding of allergic mechanisms indicates cross-reactivity between antibiotic sulfonamides and nonantibiotic sulfonamides may not occur, or at the very least this potential is extremely low (Brackett 2004; Johnson 2005; Slatore 2004; Tornero 2004). In particular, mechanisms of cross-reaction due to antibody production (anaphylaxis) are unlikely to occur with nonantibiotic sulfonamides and antibiotic sulfonamides. A nonantibiotic sulfonamide compound which contains the arylamine structure and therefore may cross-react with antibiotic sulfonamides is sulfasalazine (Zawodniak 2010). T-cell-mediated (type IV) reactions (eg, maculopapular rash) are less understood and it is not possible to completely exclude this potential based on current insights. In cases where prior reactions were severe (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/TEN), some clinicians choose to avoid exposure to these classes.</p><p>• Systemic effects: Systemic absorption is increased with application to large, infected, abraded, denuded, or burned skin.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity ("gasping syndrome") in neonates; the "gasping syndrome" consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggest that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol with caution in neonates. See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For external use only; avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, lips, and mucous membranes. Use with caution if areas of denuded or abraded skin are involved. Discontinue use if irritation, rash, or signs of hypersensitivity occur.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Signs of local irritation and/or sensitization, especially during long-term therapy.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
