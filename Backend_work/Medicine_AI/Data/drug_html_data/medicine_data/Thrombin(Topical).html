Shake gently to dissolve until clear.</p><p>Recothrom: Reconstitute using diluent provided in prefilled syringe. Gently swirl to dissolve powder; avoid excessive agitation; powder should dissolve within 1 minute at room temperature. For some vial sizes, do not use diluent syringe to withdraw solution from vial.</p><p>Thrombi-Gel: Must wet with NS or SWFI before use; may cut or roll to desired shape prior to wetting. Refer to manufacturer’s labeling for fluid volume used for wetting a specific product. Once wetted and prior to applying, knead thoroughly to saturate the pad and remove trapped air bubbles.</p><p>Thrombin-JMI: Used as drug powder or wetted. If wetted, reconstitute with NS or provided diluent to a concentration of 1,000 to 2,000 units/mL using a syringe or transfer device. In cases in which approximately 1,000 units/mL is desired, reconstitute with entire vial of provided diluent. When used with Gel-Flow NT, reconstitute the 5,000 unit syringe spray kit with 5 mL NS.</p><p>Thrombi-Pad: Used dry or wetted with up to 10 mL of NS.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>For topical use only; do not administer intravenously or intra-arterially.</p><p>Evithrom: Sponge or suction target surface free of blood prior to application (do not wipe). Use syringe and small-gauge needle to apply; avoid sponging the clot after application. When used in conjunction with absorbable gelatin sponge, transfer solution to sterile container and immerse gelatin sponge(s) into solution; vigorously knead until all air is expelled and sponge can return to its original size and shape; hold sponge in place with gauze or cotton pledget using moderate pressure until hemostasis is achieved.</p><p>Recothrom: May apply reconstituted solution directly using ZymoGenetics spray applicator kit or in combination with absorbable gelatin sponge. When using spray applicator, use the sterile bowl in kit as receptacle for reconstituted solution; refer to spray kit manufacturer’s labeling for spray pump and syringe spray assembly and use. When used in conjunction with absorbable gelatin sponge(s), transfer solution to sterile container and immerse gelatin sponge(s) into solution until completely saturated; gently squeeze to remove excess solution; apply sponge(s) to bleeding site in a single layer.</p><p>Thrombi-Gel: After wetting, place directly over bleeding source and apply adjunct manual compression until hemostasis is achieved; may cut or roll to desired shape prior to wetting.</p><p>Thrombin-JMI: Sponge (do not wipe) application surface prior to use, if possible. Apply as dry powder or reconstituted solution. When used as a solution, flood surface using a sterile syringe with a small-gauge needle or use in conjunction with Thrombin-JMI pump spray kit, syringe spray kit, or epistaxis kit; refer to manufacturer’s kit labeling for assembly and use. The 5,000 unit syringe spray kit may be used to saturate gelatin powder in Gel-Flow NT; mixture may be smeared, filled or pressed against surface to control bleeding (refer to Gel-Flow NT product labeling for preparation instructions). When used in conjunction with absorbable gelatin sponge, immerse sponge strips into solution; vigorously knead sponge with moistened gloved fingers until all air is expelled; apply saturated sponge to bleeding area; hold in place with gauze or cotton pledget using moderate pressure until hemostasis is achieved. Product is most effective when it mixes freely with blood as soon as it reaches the surface. Avoid sponging of treated surfaces.</p><p>Thrombi-Pad: Apply dry or wet directly to the bleeding source and apply adjunct manual compression; may be left in place for up to 24 hours. To remove, do not disrupt clot by physical manipulation. If pad adheres to the site, irrigate with nonheparinized NS and remove.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>All products: Store at 2°C to 25°C (36°F to 77°F) prior to reconstitution or wetting.</p><p>Evithrom: Protect from light.

Thrombosis may result from the development of antibodies against bovine thrombin. Bleeding may result from the development of antibodies against factor V.  These may cross-react with human factor V and lead to its deficiency.  Do not re-expose patients to thrombin topical (bovine) if there are known or suspected antibodies to bovine thrombin and/or factor V.  Monitor patients for abnormal coagulation laboratory values, bleeding, or thrombosis.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Institute supportive measure and treat individual symptoms immediately.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Human plasma product: Evithrom is a product of human plasma; may potentially contain infectious agents that could transmit infectious agents, such as viruses and, theoretically the Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease agent, or unknown infectious agents. Screening of donors, as well as testing and/or inactivation or removal of certain viruses, reduces the risk. Infections thought to be transmitted by this product should be reported to the manufacturer.</p><p>• Infection risk: Thrombi-Gel and Thrombi-Pad: Do not use in the presence of infection; use caution in areas of contamination.</p><p>• Nonabsorbable product: Thrombi-Pad: Do not use as a replacement for absorbable hemostats. Product is nonabsorbable; do not leave in the body.</p><p>• Proteins (snake and hamster origin): Recothrom: Use caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to snake or hamster proteins (manufacturing process uses a genetically modified hamster cell line and snake proteins); the potential for allergic reaction theoretically exists.</p><p>• Severe bleeding and thrombosis complications: Thrombin-JMI, Thrombi-Gel, and Thrombi-Pad only. <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Thrombin topical (bovine) can cause fatal severe bleeding or thrombosis. Thrombosis may result from the development of antibodies against bovine thrombin. Bleeding may result from the development of antibodies against factor V.
