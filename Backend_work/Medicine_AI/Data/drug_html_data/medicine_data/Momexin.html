</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION:</span> MomexinTM Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% contains mometasone furoate, USP for dermatologic use.  Mometasone furoate<br/>
is a synthetic corticosteroid with antiinflammatory activity.<br/></p><p>Chemically, mometasone furoate is 9a,21-Dichloro-11b,17- dihydroxy-16a-methylpregna-1, 4-diene-3,20-dione 17-(2-furoate), with the empirical formula<br/>
C27H30CI2O6, a molecular weight of 521.4 and the following structural formula:</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>Mometasone furoate is a white to off-white powder practically insoluble in water, slightly soluble in octanol, and moderately soluble in ethyl alcohol.<br/>
Each gram of Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% contains: 1 mg mometasone furoate, USP in a cream base of hexylene glycol,<br/>
phosphoric acid, propylene glycol stearate, stearyl alcohol and ceteareth-20, titanium dioxide, aluminum starch octenylsuccinate,<br/>
white wax, white petrolatum, and purified water.<br/></p><p class="First">The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive<br/>
dressings with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours have not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly<br/>
enhances penetration.</p><p>Studies in humans indicate that approximately 0.4% of the applied dose of Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% enters the circulation after 8 hours of contact on normal skin without<br/>
occlusion. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. <br/></p><p>Studies performed with Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% indicate that it is in the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids.</p><p>In a study evaluating the effects of mometasone furoate cream on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, 15 grams were applied twice daily for 7 days to six adult patients with<br/>
psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. The cream was applied without occlusion to at least 30% of the body surface. The results show that the drug caused a slight lowering of adrenal corticosteroid<br/>
secretion.</p><p class="First">Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:</p><p>1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes.<br/></p><p>2. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed.<br/></p><p>3. The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped so as to be occlusive, unless directed by<br/>
the physician.</p><p>4. Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse reactions.<br/></p><p>5. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% in the treatment of diaper<br/>
dermatitis. Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% should not be applied in the diaper area as diapers or plastic pants may<br/>
constitute occlusive dressing (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p><p>6. This medication should not be used on the face, underarm or groin areas unless directed by the physician. <br/></p><p>7. As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved.  If no improvement is<br/>
seen within 2 weeks, contact physicion.</p><p>8.  Other corticosteroid-containing products should not be used with Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.01%<br/>
without first consulting with the physician.<br/></p><p class="First">The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression:<br/>
ACTH stimulation test<br/>
A.M. plasma cortisol test<br/>
Urinary free cortisol test<br/></p><p class="ddc-disclaimer-link">Medical Disclaimer</p></body></html>
