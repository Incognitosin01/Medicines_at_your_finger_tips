Teriparatide forms new bone, increases bone mineral density and bone strength, and as a result reduces the chance of getting a fracture (broken bone). Teriparatide can be used by men or postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are at high risk for having fractures. Teriparatide can be used by people who have had a fracture related to osteoporosis, or who have multiple risk factors for fracture, or who cannot use other osteoporosis treatments.</p><p>Teriparatide has been used by injection into a vein as a test to help diagnose problems of the parathyroid gland. This test determines whether you have hypoparathyroidism or a type of pseudohypoparathyroidism.</p><p>This product, for use as a test to help diagnose problems of the parathyroid gland, was withdrawn from the U.S. market in January 1997.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using teriparatide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
