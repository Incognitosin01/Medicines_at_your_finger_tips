Vitamin <span class="Sub">9</span> metabolism can be affected by malabsorption issues which differ widely among population groups. The March 5, 1996 Federal Register Notice (61 FR 8760) states that "The agency concluded that <span class="Bold Italics">the scientific literature did not support the superiority of any one source of vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> over others, and that the data were insufficient to provide a basis for stating that a specific amount of vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> is more effective than another amount</span> [emphasis added]." The actual amount and source of vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> require a licensed medical practitioner's supervision to achieve a satisfactory maintenance level, and may exceed the 0.8 mg UL. The Federal Register Notice of August 2, 1973 (38 FR 20750) specifically states that "dietary supplement preparations are available without a prescription (21 CFR 121.1134). <span class="Bold Italics">Levels higher than dietary supplement amounts are available only with a prescription. Oral preparations supplying more than 0.8 mg of vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> per dosage unit would be restricted to prescription dispensing</span> and that a dietary supplement furnishing 0.8 mg <span class="Italics">could be</span> prescribed when a maintenance level of 0.8 mg per day was indicated. When clinical symptoms have subsided and the blood picture and/or CSF vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> levels have become normal, a maintenance level should be used. Patients should be kept under close supervision and adjustment of the maintenance level made if relapse appears imminent. In the presence of alcoholism, hemolytic anemia, anticonvulsant therapy, or chronic infection, the maintenance level may need to be increased [emphasis added]." However, once the level of active vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> exceeds 0.8 mg - as prescribed dosages, then the product is no longer a medical food but a <span class="Bold">dietary management / prescription (R<span class="Sub">x</span>)-vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span></span> regardless of pregnancy/lactation status in spite of the fact that folic acid - including reduced forms, may be added to medical foods as defined in section 5(b)(3) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 USC 360ee(b)(3)), or to food (21 CFR 172.345). In the Letter Regarding Dietary Supplement Health Claim for Folic Acid, Vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span>, and Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> and Vascular Disease (Docket No. 99P-3029) dated November 28, 2000, FDA wrote "... high intakes of vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> may partially and temporarily correct pernicious anemia while the neurological damage of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency progresses. IOM/NAS (1998) set the UL for all adults of 1 mg per day because of devastating and irreversible neurological consequences of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency, the data suggesting that <span class="Bold Italics">pernicious anemia may develop at a younger age in some racial or ethnic groups, and the uncertainty about the extent of the occurrence of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency in <span class="Bold">younger age groups</span></span> (IOM/NAS, 1998) [emphasis added]." Summary: This product is a dietary management product that - due to advanced vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> levels, requires administration under the care of a licensed medical practitioner, and the most appropriate way to do that is to provide the product as prescription for pedigree reporting and safety monitoring. The ingredients, indication or claims of this product are not to be construed to be drug claims.</p><h2>REFERENCES:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">VITAMIN B<span class="Sub">9</span> MECHANISM OF ACTION:</span> Vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> is essential for the production of certain coenzymes in many metabolic systems such as purine and pyrimidine synthesis. It is also essential in the synthesis and maintenance of nucleoprotein in erythropoiesis. It also promotes white blood cell (WBC) and platelet production in vitamin B9-deficiency anemia. Vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> is associated with methylation and transformylation biochemistry.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INTERACTIONS:</span> Talk to your healthcare practitioner and/or pharmacist before taking or using any prescription or over-the-counter medicines or herbal/health supplements alongside this product.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS:</span> Allergic reactions have been reported following the use of oral and parenteral vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span>. Mild transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, itching, transitory exanthema and the feeling of swelling of the entire body has been associated with cobalamin. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, transient skin rash, flushing, epigastric pain, and constipation have been associated with acetylcysteine.</p><p>Call your medical practitioner about side effects.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS:</span> This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components contained in this product.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span> Caution is recommended in patients with a history of bipolar illness. Mood elevation is possible in this population.</p><p>Caution is also recommended in patients taking anticonvulsant medications as vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> may interfere with anticonvulsant medication, and may lower seizure threshold.</p><p>Patients undergoing cancer treatment should consult their licensed medical practitioner for advice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> Vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is deficient. Vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations progress.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PREGNANCY and NURSING MOTHERS:</span> This product is not intended for use as a prenatal/postnatal multivitamin for lactating and non-lactating mothers. This product contains B vitamins plus NAC. Talk with your medical practitioner before using if pregnant or lactating.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HOW SUPPLIED:</span> Levomefolate Calcium/Acetylcysteine/Mecobalamin/Algal Powder (6 mg-600 mg-2 mg-90.314 mg) is supplied as a coated, gray caplet debossed "V324", dispensed in bottles of 1000 caplets.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics"><span class="Sup">†</span>This product is a prescription-vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> with or without other dietary ingredients that - due to increased vitamin B9 levels (AUG 2 1973 FR 20750), requires an R<span class="Sub">x</span> on the label because of increased risk associated with masking of B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency (pernicious anemia). Based on our assessment of the risk of obscuring pernicious anemia, this product requires licensed medical supervision, an Rx status, and a National Drug Code (NDC) - or similar product code, as required by pedigree reporting requirements and supply-chain control as well as - in some cases, for insurance-reimbursement applications.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Manufactured for:</span><br/>
