Periodontal disease is caused by bacteria growing beneath the gum line. Doxycycline works by keeping the number of bacteria from growing. Lowering the amount of bacteria helps to reduce inflammation and swelling in your mouth, and the amount of bleeding around the teeth. Doxycycline is placed in deep gum pockets next to your teeth in order to reduce the depth of the pockets.</p><p>Doxycycline will be applied by your dentist or other oral health care professional.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using doxycycline</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of doxycycline</h2><p>Doxycycline periodontal system is placed by your dentist into one or more deep gum pockets next to your teeth. A dental dressing or adhesive will be placed on top to help keep the system in place. The treatment may be repeated four months later.</p><p>The treatment period for the doxycycline periodontal system is seven days after your dentist inserts it. If the system comes loose or falls out before the 7 days are up, check with your dentist.</p><p>Doxycycline periodontal system does not have to be removed by the dentist; it will dissolve. The dental dressing or adhesive that holds the system in place may fall out naturally. However, if the dental dressing or adhesive is still present after 7 days, it should be removed by the dentist.</p><p>After the medicine is placed in your mouth, try to avoid any actions that may cause the medicine to come out. For example:</p><ul>
<li>Do not brush around the teeth that have been treated for 7 days.</li>
<li>Do not use dental floss or any other cleaning tools that go between the teeth for 7 days after treatment.</li>
