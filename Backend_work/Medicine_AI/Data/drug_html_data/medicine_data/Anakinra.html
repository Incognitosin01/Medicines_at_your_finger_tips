Anakinra may also help slow the progress of the disease. Anakinra is usually given after other arthritis medications have been tried without successful treatment of symptoms.</p><p>Anakinra is also used in newborn babies to treat a rare genetic condition called neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID). NOMID is a form of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). This condition causes uncontrolled inflammation in many parts of the body, including the skin, joints, and central nervous system.</p><p>Anakinra may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use  anakinra if you are allergic to medicines that contain E. coli bacteria proteins, or if you have an active infection.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use this medicine if you are allergic to anakinra or to other medicines that contain E. coli bacteria proteins.

Do not use  anakinra in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Anakinra is injected under the skin. You may be shown how to use injections at home. Do not inject this medicine yourself if you do not understand how to use the injection and properly dispose of used needles and syringes.</p><p>Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>Anakinra is usually given once per day, or once every other day. Follow your doctor's instructions. Inject your dose at the same time of day when you use the medicine.</p><p>Your care provider will show you the best places on your body to inject anakinra. Use a different place each time you give an injection. Do not inject into the same place two times in a row. Each injection should be given at least 1 inch away from where you last injected the medicine.</p><p><b>Do not shake the prefilled syringe</b> or you may ruin the medicine. Prepare your dose in a syringe only when you are ready to give yourself an injection. Do not use the medication if it has changed colors, looks cloudy, or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medication.</p><p>Each prefilled syringe of anakinra is for one use only. Throw away after one use, even if there is still some medicine left in it after injecting your dose.</p><p>Use a disposable needle and syringe only once. Follow any state or local laws about throwing away used needles and syringes. Use a puncture-proof "sharps" disposal container (ask your pharmacist where to get one and how to throw it away). Keep this container out of the reach of children and pets.</p><p>Use anakinra regularly to get the most benefit. Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely.</p><p>Call your doctor if your arthritis symptoms do not improve, or if they get worse while using anakinra.</p><p>Anakinra can lower blood cells that help your body fight infections. This can make it easier for you to get sick from being around others who are ill. You will need regular medical tests to be sure this medicine is not causing harmful effects. Your doctor may also want to check your blood cells for several months after you stop using anakinra. Visit your doctor regularly.</p><p>Store in the refrigerator, do not freeze.
