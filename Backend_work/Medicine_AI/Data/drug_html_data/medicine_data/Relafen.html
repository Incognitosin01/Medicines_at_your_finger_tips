Nabumetone works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body.</p><p>Relafen is used to relieve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.</p><p>Relafen may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Relafen can increase your risk of fatal heart attack or stroke, especially if you use it long term or take high doses, or if you have heart disease. Do not use this medicine just before or after heart bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG).</p><p>Relafen may also cause stomach or intestinal bleeding, which can be fatal. These conditions can occur without warning while you are using Relafen, especially in older adults.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have symptoms of bleeding in your stomach or intestines. This includes black, bloody, or tarry stools, or coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.</p><p>Do not use any other over-the-counter cold, allergy, or pain medication without first asking your doctor or pharmacist. Many medicines available over the counter contain aspirin or other medicines similar to Relafen (such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, or naproxen). If you take certain products together you may accidentally take too much of this type of medication. Read the label of any other medicine you are using to see if it contains aspirin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, or naproxen. Do not drink alcohol while taking Relafen. Alcohol can increase the risk of stomach bleeding caused by nabumetone. Avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays (sunlamps or tanning beds). Relafen can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight and sunburn may result.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Relafen can increase your risk of fatal heart attack or stroke, especially if you use it long term or take high doses, or if you have heart disease.
