</ul><h2>Desmopressin Rhinal Tube Description</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE Rhinal Tube </span>is a synthetic analogue of the natural pituitary hormone 8-arginine vasopressin (ADH), an antidiuretic hormone affecting renal water conservation. It is chemically defined as follows:</p><p>Mol. wt. 1183.34 Empirical formula: C<span class="Sub">46</span>H<span class="Sub">64</span>N<span class="Sub">14</span>O<span class="Sub">12</span>S<span class="Sub">2</span>•C<span class="Sub">2</span>H<span class="Sub">4</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>•3H<span class="Sub">2</span>O</p><p> <br/>
<br/></p><p>1-(3-mercaptopropionic acid)-8-D-arginine vasopressin monoacetate (salt) trihydrate.</p><p><span class="Bold">DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE Rhinal Tube </span>is provided as an aqueous solution for intranasal use.</p><p>Each mL contains:</p><h2>Desmopressin Rhinal Tube - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE Rhinal Tube </span>contains as active substance desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. One mL (0.1 mg) of intranasal DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE has an antidiuretic activity of about 400 IU; 10 mcg of desmopressin acetate is equivalent to 40 IU.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Desmopressin Rhinal Tube</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Central Cranial Diabetes Insipidus:</span> <span class="Bold">DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE Rhinal Tube </span>is indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central cranial diabetes insipidus and for management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. It is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.</p><p>The use of<span class="Bold"> DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE Rhinal Tube</span> in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with increase in urine osmolality and a decrease in plasma osmolality. This will allow the resumption of a more normal life-style with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia.</p><p>There are reports of an occasional change in response with time, usually greater than 6 months. Some patients may show a decreased responsiveness, others a shortened duration of effect. There is no evidence this effect is due to the development of binding antibodies but may be due to a local inactivation of the peptide.</p><p>Patients are selected for therapy by establishing the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or the response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to intranasal DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE can be monitored by urine volume and osmolality.</p><p>DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE is also available as a solution for injection when the intranasal route may be compromised. These situations include nasal congestion and blockage, nasal discharge, atrophy of nasal mucosa, and severe atrophic rhinitis. Intranasal delivery may also be inappropriate where there is an impaired level of consciousness. In addition, cranial surgical procedures, such as transsphenoidal hypophysectomy create situations where an alternative route of administration is needed as in cases of nasal packing or recovery from surgery.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE Rhinal Tube</span> is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of<span class="Bold"> DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE Rhinal Tube</span>.</p><p>DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50mL/min).</p><p>DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia or a history of hyponatremia.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> Intranasal DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE at high dosage has infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure, which disappeared with a reduction in dosage. The drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease because of possible rise in blood pressure.</p><p>DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure and renal disorders, because these patients are prone to hyponatremia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Ensure that in children administration is under adult supervision in order to control the dose intake.</span></p><p>Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal administration of DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE.</p><p><span class="Bold">Central Cranial Diabetes Insipidus:</span> Since <span class="Bold">DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE Rhinal Tube </span>is used intranasally, changes in the nasal mucosa such as scarring, edema, or other disease may cause erratic, unreliable absorption in which case intranasal DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE should not be used. For such situations, DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE Injection should be considered.</p><p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests:</span> Laboratory tests for following the patient with central cranial diabetes insipidus or post-surgical or head trauma-related polyuria and polydipsia include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases plasma osmolality measurements may be required.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span> Although the pressor activity of DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE is very low compared to the antidiuretic activity, use of large doses of intranasal DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE with other pressor agents should only be done with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution.</p><p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span> Studies with DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category B:</span> Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) revealed no harm to the fetus due to DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p>Several publications of desmopressin acetate's use in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year, Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 10 mcg. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE is administered to a nursing woman.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> Central Cranial Diabetes Insipidus: <span class="Bold">DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE Rhinal Tube </span>has been used in pediatric patients with diabetes insipidus. Use in infants and pediatric patients will require careful fluid intake restriction to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. (See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.) The dose must be individually adjusted to the patient with attention in the very young to the danger of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality with resulting convulsions. Dose should start at 0.05 mL or less.</p><p>There are reports of an occasional change in response with time, usually greater than 6 months. Some patients may show a decreased responsiveness, others a shortened duration of effect. There is no evidence this effect is due to the development of binding antibodies but may be due to a local inactivation of the peptide.</p><p><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use:</span> Clinical studies of DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE Rhinal Tube did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance below 50ml/min). (See <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>, Human Pharmacokinetics and <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>.)</p><p>Use of DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE Rhinal Tube in geriatric patients will require careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Fluid restriction should be discussed with the patient. (See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.)</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Infrequently, high dosages of intranasal DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE have produced transient headache and nausea. Nasal congestion, rhinitis and flushing have also been reported occasionally along with mild abdominal cramps. These symptoms disappeared with reduction in dosage. Nosebleed, sore throat, cough and upper respiratory infections have also been reported.</p><p>The following table lists the percent of patients having adverse experiences without regard to relationship to study drug from the pooled pivotal study data for nocturnal enuresis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Post Marketing:</span> There have been rare reports of hyponatremic convulsions associated with concomitant use with the following medications: oxybutinin and imipramine.</p><p>See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS </span>for the possibility of water intoxication and hyponatremia.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Signs of overdose may include confusion, drowsiness, continuing headache, problems with passing urine and rapid weight gain due to fluid retention. (See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.) In case of overdosage, the dose should be reduced, frequency of administration decreased, or drug withdrawn according to the severity of the condition. There is no known specific antidote for desmopressin acetate or <span class="Bold">DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE Rhinal Tube</span>.</p><p>An oral LD<span class="Sub">50 </span>has not been established. An intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg in mice demonstrated no effect.</p><h2>Desmopressin Rhinal Tube Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Central Cranial Diabetes Insipidus:</span> This drug is administered into the nose through a soft, flexible plastic rhinal tube which has four graduation marks on it that measure 0.2, 0.15, 0.1 and 0.05 mL. <span class="Bold">DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE Rhinal Tube</span> dosage must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to the diurnal pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients with nasal congestion and blockage have often responded well to intranasal DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE. The usual dosage range in adults is 0.1 to 0.4 mL daily, either as a single dose or divided into two or three doses. Most adults require 0.2 mL daily in two divided doses. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. For children aged 3 months to 12 years, the usual dosage range is 0.05 to 0.3 mL daily, either as a single dose or divided into two doses. About 1/4 to 1/3 of patients can be controlled by a single daily dose of DESMOPRESSIN ACETATE administered intranasally. Fluid restriction should be observed.
