Excess nitrogen can cause hyperammonemia (HYE-per-AM-moe-NEE-mee-a), a build-up of ammonia in the blood. Ammonia is very toxic when it circulates in blood and tissues and can cause permanent brain damage, coma, or death.</p><p>Glycerol phenylbutyrate helps prevent a build-up of ammonia in the blood in people with urea cycle disorder.  glycerol phenylbutyrate is used in adults and children who are at least 2 months old. Glycerol phenylbutyrate will not treat hyperammonemia.</p><p>Glycerol phenylbutyrate is usually given together with a low-protein diet and sometimes dietary supplements.</p><p>Glycerol phenylbutyrate may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>This medicine can affect your nervous system. <b>Call your doctor right away if you have:</b> confusion, headaches, memory problems, hearing problems, vomiting, an altered sense of taste, numbness or tingling in your hands or feet, or if you feel unusually sleepy or light-headed.</p><p><b>Glycerol phenylbutyrate should not be given to a child under 2 months old.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use glycerol phenylbutyrate if you are allergic to it.</p><p><b>Glycerol phenylbutyrate should not be given to a child under 2 months old.</b> Do not give  glycerol phenylbutyrate to a child younger than 2 years old without medical advice.</p><p>To make sure glycerol phenylbutyrate is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
