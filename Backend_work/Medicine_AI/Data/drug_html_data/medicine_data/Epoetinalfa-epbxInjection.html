If the body does not produce enough red blood cells, severe anemia can occur. This often occurs in people with chronic kidney failure whose kidneys are not working properly. Epoetin alfa-epbx may be used for patients on kidney dialysis or for those not on dialysis. Anemia can also occur in people who are receiving cancer treatment to treat cancer or in patients with HIV who are receiving zidovudine. Epoetin alfa-epbx is used to treat severe anemia in these patients.</p><p>Epoetin alfa-epbx injection is also used to lessen or avoid the need for blood transfusion in patients scheduled for any type of surgery where a lot of blood loss is expected.</p><p>Epoetin alfa-epbx is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using epoetin alfa-epbx</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For epoetin alfa-epbx, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to epoetin alfa-epbx or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of epoetin alfa-epbx <i>single-dose vial</i> in children 1 month of age and older. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 1 month of age with chronic kidney disease on dialysis, in children not on dialysis, or in children younger than 5 years of age with cancer. Epoetin alfa-epbx <i>multiple-dose vial</i> should not be used in newborn or infants.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of epoetin alfa-epbx injection in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of epoetin alfa-epbx.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of epoetin alfa-epbx</h2><p>Epoetin alfa-epbx injection is usually given by a doctor in a hospital or clinic.

When epoetin alfa-epbx begins to work, most people start to feel better. Some people are able to be more active. But epoetin alfa-epbx only corrects anemia. It has no effect on kidney disease, cancer, or any other medical problem that needs regular medical attention. Even if you are feeling much better, <i>it is very important that you do not miss any appointments with your doctor or any dialysis treatments</i>.</p><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's blood on a regular basis while you are using epoetin alfa-epbx</i>. You may also need to monitor your blood pressure at home. If you notice any changes to your recommended blood pressure, call your doctor right away.</p><p>Using epoetin alfa-epbx <i>multiple-dose vial</i> while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Epoetin alfa-epbx <i>multiple-dose vial</i> contains benzyl alcohol, which may cause serious reactions to newborn or premature babies. Discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned.</p><p>Epoetin alfa-epbx may increase your risk of having blood clots. This is more likely in patients who use high doses of epoetin alfa-epbx, or who use epoetin alfa-epbx before major surgery. If you have chest pain, trouble breathing, or pain, redness, or swelling in your arms or legs while using epoetin alfa-epbx, call your doctor right away. If you are getting kidney dialysis treatments, tell your doctor right away if you notice blood clots at your injection site. Your doctor may give you a blood thinner before surgery to help prevent blood clots.</p><p>Epoetin alfa-epbx may also increase your risk of having serious heart and blood vessel problems such as a heart attack, congestive heart failure, or stroke. Check with your doctor right away if you start having dizziness, fainting spells, severe tiredness, chest pain, trouble with breathing, sudden or severe headache, or problems with vision, speech, or walking.</p><p>When used in patients with certain types of cancer (eg, breast, cervix, lymphoid, lung, head, or neck cancer), epoetin alfa-epbx has shortened survival time and worsened the tumor or cancer in some patients. If you are concerned about this, talk with your doctor.</p><p>Epoetin alfa-epbx sometimes causes convulsions (seizures), especially during the first few months of treatment. During this time, it is best to <i>avoid driving, operating heavy machinery, or other activities that could cause a serious injury if a seizure occurs while you are performing them</i>.</p><p>Epoetin alfa-epbx may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema. These can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after using epoetin alfa-epbx.</p><p>Serious skin reactions can occur with epoetin alfa-epbx. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, red skin lesions, severe acne or a skin rash, sores or ulcers on the skin, or fever or chills with epoetin alfa-epbx.</p><p>Many people with kidney problems need to be on a special diet. Also, people with high blood pressure (which may be caused by kidney disease or by epoetin treatment) may need to be on a special diet or to take medicine to keep their blood pressure under control. After their anemia has been corrected, some people feel so much better that they want to eat more than before. To keep your kidney disease or your high blood pressure from getting worse, it is very important that you or your child follow your special diet and take your medicines regularly, even if you are feeling better.</p><p>In addition to epoetin, your body needs iron and vitamins to make red blood cells. Your doctor may direct you or your child to take iron or vitamin supplements. Be sure to follow your doctor's orders carefully. Epoetin alfa-epbx will not work properly if there is not enough iron or vitamins in your body.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Epoetin alfa-epbx side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
