Recommended dosage adjustments for adults are shown in Table 1. In order to calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this, an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:</p><p>                 [140-age (years)] x weight (kg)<br/>
CLcr =   ----------------------------------------------   (x 0.85 for female patients)<br/>
                 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)<br/></p><p>Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:</p><p>                                                 CLcr (mL/min)<br/>
CLcr (mL/min/1.73m <span class="Sup">2</span>) =    -----------------------------    x 1.73<br/>

Reactions have included anaphylaxis and angioedema <span class="Italics">[ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]</span> .</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Behavioral Abnormalities and Psychotic Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Levetiracetam extended-release tablets may cause behavioral abnormalities and psychotic symptoms. Patients treated with levetiracetam extended-release tablets should be monitored for psychiatric signs and symptoms.</p><p><span class="Bold">Behavioral abnormalities</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Levetiracetam Extended-Release Tablets</span><br/>
A total of 7% of levetiracetam extended-release tablets - treated patients experienced non-psychotic behavioral disorders (reported as irritability and aggression) compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. Irritability was reported in 7% of levetiracetam extended- release tablets - treated patients. Aggression was reported in 1% of levetiracetam extended-release tablets - treated patients.</p><p>No patient discontinued treatment or had a dose reduction as a result of these adverse reactions.</p><p>The number of patients exposed to levetiracetam extended-release tablets was considerably smaller than the number of patients exposed to immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in controlled trials. Therefore, certain adverse reactions observed in the immediate-release levetiracetam tablets controlled trials will likely occur in patients receiving levetiracetam extended-release tablets.</p><p><span class="Italics">Immediate-Release Levetiracetam Tablets</span><br/>
<br/>
A total of 13% of adult patients and 38% of pediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age) treated with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets experienced non-psychotic behavioral symptoms (reported as aggression, agitation, anger, anxiety, apathy, depersonalization, depression, emotional lability, hostility, hyperkinesias, irritability, nervousness, neurosis, and personality disorder), compared to 6% and 19% of adult and pediatric patients on placebo. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age). An exploratory analysis suggested a worsening in aggressive behavior in patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in that study [ <span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</span>].</p><p>A total of 1.7% of adult patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets discontinued treatment due to behavioral adverse reactions, compared to 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. The treatment dose was reduced in 0.8% of adult patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets, compared to 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Overall, 11% of pediatric patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets experienced behavioral symptoms associated with discontinuation or dose reduction, compared to 6.2% of placebo-treated pediatric patients.</p><p>One percent of adult patients and 2% of pediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age) treated with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets experienced psychotic symptoms, compared to 0.2% and 2%, respectively, in adult and placebo-treated pediatric patients. In the controlled study that assessed the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in pediatric patients 4 to 16 years of age, 1.6% levetiracetam -treated patients experienced paranoia, compared to no placebo-treated patients. There were 3.1% patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets who experienced confusional state, compared to no placebo-treated patients [ <span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Psychotic symptoms</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Immediate-Release Levetiracetam Tablets</span><br/>
One percent of levetiracetam-treated adult patients experienced psychotic symptoms compared to 0.2% of placebo-treated patients.</p><p>Two (0.3%) levetiracetam-treated adult patients were hospitalized and their treatment was discontinued due to psychosis. Both events, reported as psychosis, developed within the first week of treatment and resolved within 1 to 2 weeks following treatment discontinuation. There was no difference between drug and placebo-treated patients in the incidence of pediatric patients who discontinued treatment due to psychotic and non-psychotic adverse reactions.</p><h3>Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</h3><p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including levetiracetam extended-release tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p><p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p><p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis</span></p><p class="First">Indication</p><p class="First">Placebo Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients</p><p class="First">Drug Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients</p><p class="First">Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients</p><p class="First">Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1,000 Patients</p><p class="First">Epilepsy</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">3.4</p><p class="First">3.5</p><p class="First">2.4</p><p class="First">Psychiatric</p><p class="First">5.7</p><p class="First">8.5</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">2.9</p><p class="First">Other</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">1.9</p><p class="First">0.9</p><p class="First">Total</p><p class="First">2.4</p><p class="First">4.3</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">1.9</p><p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.</p><p>Anyone considering prescribing levetiracetam extended-release tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p><h3>Somnolence and Fatigue</h3><p class="First">Levetiracetam extended-release tablets may cause somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be monitored for these signs and symptoms and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on levetiracetam extended-release tablets to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.</p><p><span class="Bold">Somnolence</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Levetiracetam Extended-Release Tablets</span><br/>
In the levetiracetam extended-release tablets double-blind, controlled trial in patients experiencing partial-onset seizures, 8% of levetiracetam extended-release tablets-treated patients experienced somnolence compared to 3% of placebo-treated patients.</p><p>No patient discontinued treatment or had a dose reduction as a result of these adverse reactions.</p><p>The number of patients exposed to levetiracetam extended-release tablets was considerably smaller than the number of patients exposed to immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in controlled trials. Therefore, certain adverse reactions observed in the immediate-release levetiracetam controlled trials will likely occur in patients receiving levetiracetam extended-release tablets.</p><p><span class="Italics">Immediate-Release Levetiracetam Tablets</span><br/>
In controlled trials of adult patients with epilepsy experiencing partial-onset seizures, 15% of levetiracetam-treated patients reported somnolence, compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients. There was no clear dose response up to 3,000 mg/day. In a study where there was no titration, about 45% of patients receiving 4,000 mg/day reported somnolence. The somnolence was considered serious in 0.3% of the levetiracetam-treated patients, compared to 0% in the placebo group. About 3% of levetiracetam-treated patients discontinued treatment due to somnolence, compared to 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. In 1.4% of levetiracetam-treated patients and in 0.9% of placebo-treated patients the dose was reduced, while 0.3% of the treated patients were hospitalized due to somnolence.</p><p><span class="Bold">Asthenia</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Immediate-Release Levetiracetam Tablets</span><br/>
In controlled trials of adult patients with epilepsy experiencing partial-onset seizures, 15% of levetiracetam-treated patients reported asthenia, compared to 9% of placebo-treated patients. Treatment was discontinued due to asthenia in 0.8% of levetiracetam-treated patients as compared to 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.5% of levetiracetam-treated patients and in 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to asthenia.</p><p>Somnolence and asthenia occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks of treatment.</p><h3>Anaphylaxis and Angioedema</h3><p class="First">Levetiracetam extended-release tablets can cause anaphylaxis or angioedema after the first dose or at any time during treatment. Signs and symptoms in cases reported in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with levetiracetam have included hypotension, hives, rash, respiratory distress, and swelling of the face, lip, mouth, eye, tongue, throat, and feet. In some reported cases, reactions were life-threatening and required emergency treatment. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis or angioedema, levetiracetam extended-release tablets should be discontinued and the patient should seek immediate medical attention. Levetiracetam extended-release tablets should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established <span class="Italics">[ see Contraindications (4) ]</span> .</p><h3>Serious Dermatological Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious dermatological reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in patients treated with levetiracetam. The median time of onset is reported to be 14 to 17 days, but cases have been reported at least four months after initiation of treatment. Recurrence of the serious skin reactions following rechallenge with levetiracetam has also been reported. Levetiracetam extended-release tablets should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.</p><h3>Coordination Difficulties</h3><p class="First">Coordination difficulties were not observed in the levetiracetam extended-release tablets controlled trial, however, the number of patients exposed to levetiracetam extended-release tablets was considerably smaller than the number of patients exposed to immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in controlled trials. However, adverse reactions observed in the immediate-release levetiracetam controlled trials may also occur in patients receiving levetiracetam extended-release tablets.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immediate-Release Levetiracetam Tablets</span><br/>
A total of 3.4% of adult levetiracetam-treated patients experienced coordination difficulties, (reported as either ataxia, abnormal gait, or incoordination) compared to 1.6% of placebo-treated patients. A total of 0.4% of patients in controlled trials discontinued levetiracetam treatment due to ataxia, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.7% of levetiracetam-treated patients and in 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to coordination difficulties, while one of the levetiracetam-treated patients was hospitalized due to worsening of pre-existing ataxia. These events occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks of treatment.</p><p>Patients should be monitored for these signs and symptoms and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on levetiracetam to gauge whether it could adversely affect their ability to drive or operate machinery.</p><h3>Withdrawal Seizures</h3><p class="First">As with most antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam extended-release tablets should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction, rapid discontinuation can be considered.</p><h3>Hematologic Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Levetiracetam extended-release tablets can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cell (RBC) counts; decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have also been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.</p><p>In controlled trials of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in patients experiencing partial-onset seizures, minor, but statistically significant, decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC count (0.03 x 10 <span class="Sup">6</span>/mm <span class="Sup">3</span>), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in immediate-release levetiracetam-treated patients.</p><p>A total of 3.2% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤2.8 x 10 <span class="Sup">9</span>/L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of levetiracteam-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤1.0 x 10 <span class="Sup">9</span>/L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the levetiracetam-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.</p><p>In pediatric patients (4 to &lt;16 years of age), statistically significant decreases in WBC and neutrophil counts were seen in patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam, as compared to placebo. The mean decreases from baseline in the immediate-release levetiracetam group were -0.4 × 10 <span class="Sup">9</span>/L and -0.3 × 10 <span class="Sup">9</span>/L, respectively, whereas there were small increases in the placebo group. A significant increase in mean relative lymphocyte counts was observed in 1.7% of patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam compared to a decrease of 4% in patients on placebo.</p><p>In the controlled pediatric trial, a possibly clinically significant abnormal low WBC value was observed in 3% of patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam, compared to no patients on placebo. However, there was no apparent difference between treatment groups with respect to neutrophil count. No patient was discontinued secondary to low WBC or neutrophil counts.</p><p>In the controlled pediatric cognitive and neuropsychological safety study, two subjects (6.1%) in the placebo group and 5 subjects (8.6%) in the immediate-release levetiracetam-treated group had high eosinophil count values that were possibly clinically significant (≥10% or ≥0.7X10 <span class="Sup">9</span>/L). .</p><h3>Seizure Control During Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more details in other sections of labeling:</p><ul>

In the controlled clinical study in patients with partial-onset seizures <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span> , the most common adverse reactions in patients receiving levetiracetam extended-release tablets in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were irritability and somnolence.</p><p>Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of epilepsy patients receiving levetiracetam extended-release tablets in the placebo-controlled study and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo.

In the controlled clinical study, 5% of patients receiving levetiracetam extended-release tablets and 3% receiving placebo discontinued as a result of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions that resulted in discontinuation and that occurred more frequently in levetiracetam extended-release tablets-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients were asthenia, epilepsy, mouth ulceration, rash, and respiratory failure. Each of these adverse reactions led to discontinuation in a levetiracetam extended-release tablets-treated patient and no placebo-treated patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immediate-Release Levetiracetam Tablets</span><br/>
Table 4 lists the adverse reactions in the controlled studies of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in adult patients experiencing partial-onset seizures <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span> . Although the pattern of adverse reactions in the levetiracetam extended-release tablets study seems somewhat different from that seen in partial-onset seizure controlled studies for immediate-release levetiracetam tablets, this is possibly due to the much smaller number of patients in this study compared to the immediate-release tablet studies. The adverse reactions for levetiracetam extended-release tablets are expected to be similar to those seen with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets.</p><p><span class="Italics">Adults</span><br/>
In controlled clinical studies of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets as adjunctive therapy to other AEDs in adults with partial-onset seizures, the most common adverse reactions, for events with rates greater than placebo, were somnolence, asthenia, infection, and dizziness.</p><p>Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of adult epilepsy patients receiving immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in placebo-controlled studies and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo.

The target dose of immediate-release levetiracetam was 60 mg/kg/day. Neurocognitive effects were measured by the Leiter-R Attention and Memory (AM) Battery, which assesses various aspects of a child's memory and attention. Although no substantive differences were observed between the placebo- and levetiracetam-treated groups in the median change from baseline in this battery, the study was not adequate to assess formal statistical non-inferiority between the drug and placebo. The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6 to 18), a standardized validated tool used to assess a child’s competencies and behavioral/emotional problems, was also assessed in this study. An analysis of the CBCL/6 to 18 indicated a worsening in aggressive behavior, one of the eight syndrome scores, in patients treated with levetiracetam [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data</span></p><p>Studies of levetiracetam in juvenile rats (dosed on postnatal days 4 through 52) and dogs (dosed from postnatal weeks 3 through 7) at doses of up to 1,800 mg/kg/day (approximately 7 and 24 times, respectively, the maximum recommended pediatric dose of 60 mg/kg/day on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis) did not demonstrate adverse effects on postnatal development.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">There were insufficient numbers of elderly subjects in controlled trials of epilepsy to adequately assess the effectiveness of levetiracetam extended-release tablets in these patients. It is expected that the safety of levetiracetam extended-release tablets in elderly patients 65 and over would be comparable to the safety observed in clinical studies of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets.</p><p>There were 347 subjects in clinical studies of immediate-release levetiracetam that were 65 and over. No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. There were insufficient numbers of elderly subjects in controlled trials of epilepsy to adequately assess the effectiveness of immediate-release levetiracetam in these patients.</p><p>Levetiracetam is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [ <span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The effect of levetiracetam extended-release tablets on renally impaired patients was not assessed in the controlled study. However, it is expected that the effect on levetiracetam extended-release tablets-treated patients would be similar to the effect seen in controlled studies of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets. Clearance of levetiracetam is decreased in patients with renal impairment and is correlated with creatinine clearance [ <span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> Dose adjustment is recommended for patients with impaired renal function [ <span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span>].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Signs, Symptoms and Laboratory Findings of Acute Overdosage in Humans</h3><p class="First">The signs and symptoms for levetiracetam extended-release tablets overdose are expected to be similar to those seen with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets.</p><p>The highest known dose of oral immediate-release levetiracetam received in the clinical development program was 6,000 mg/day. Other than drowsiness, there were no adverse reactions in the few known cases of overdose in clinical trials. Cases of somnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression and coma were observed with immediate-release levetiracetam overdoses in postmarketing use.</p><h3>Management of Overdose</h3><p class="First">There is no specific antidote for overdose with levetiracetam extended-release tablets. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient’s clinical status. A Certified Poison Control Center should be contacted for up to date information on the management of overdose with levetiracetam extended-release tablets.</p><h3>Hemodialysis</h3><p class="First">Standard hemodialysis procedures result in significant clearance of levetiracetam (approximately 50% in 4 hours) and should be considered in cases of overdose. Although hemodialysis has not been performed in the few known cases of overdose, it may be indicated by the patient's clinical state or in patients with significant renal impairment.</p><h2>Levetiracetam Extended Release Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Levetiracetam extended-release tablets, USP is an antiepileptic drug available as 500 mg and 750 mg (white) tablets for oral administration.</p><p>The chemical name of levetiracetam, a single enantiomer, is (-)-(S)-α-ethyl-2-oxo-1- pyrrolidine acetamide, its molecular formula is C <span class="Sub">8</span>H <span class="Sub">14</span>N <span class="Sub">2</span>O <span class="Sub">2</span> and its molecular weight is 170.21. Levetiracetam is chemically unrelated to existing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). It has the following structural formula:</p><p>Levetiracetam is a white to off-white crystalline powder with a faint odor and a bitter taste. It is very soluble in water (104.0 g/100 mL). It is freely soluble in chloroform (65.3 g/100 mL) and in methanol (53.6 g/100 mL), soluble in ethanol (16.5 g/100 mL), sparingly soluble in acetonitrile (5.7 g/100 mL) and practically insoluble in n-hexane. (Solubility limits are expressed as g/100 mL solvent.)</p><p>Levetiracetam extended-release tablets, USP contain the labeled amount of levetiracetam, USP. Inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, povidone, opadry white (03F180003). Opadry white (03F180003) contains hypromellose, titanium dioxide, macrogol and talc.</p><p>The medication is combined with a drug release controlling polymer that provides a drug release at a controlled rate. The biologically inert components of the tablet may occasionally remain intact during GI transit and will be eliminated in the feces as a soft, hydrated mass.</p><p>This product meets the requirements of <span class="Italics">USP Dissolution Test 2.</span></p><h2>Levetiracetam Extended Release Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The precise mechanism(s) by which levetiracetam exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown.</p><p>A saturable and stereoselective neuronal binding site in rat brain tissue has been described for levetiracetam. Experimental data indicate that this binding site is the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, thought to be involved in the regulation of vesicle exocytosis. Although the molecular significance of levetiracetam binding to synaptic vesicle protein SV2A is not understood, levetiracetam and related analogs showed a rank order of affinity for SV2A which correlated with the potency of their antiseizure activity in audiogenic seizure-prone mice. These findings suggest that the interaction of levetiracetam with the SV2A protein may contribute to the antiepileptic mechanism of action of the drug.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on QTc Interval</span><br/>
The effects of levetiracetam extended-release tablets on QTc prolongation is expected to be the same as that of immediate-release levetiracetam. The effect of immediate-release levetiracetam on QTc prolongation was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) and placebo-controlled crossover study of levetiracetam (1,000 mg or 5,000 mg) in 52 healthy subjects. The upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc was below 10 milliseconds. Therefore, there was no evidence of significant QTc prolongation in this study.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Overview</span><br/>
<br/>
Bioavailability of levetiracetam extended-release tablets are similar to that of the immediate-release levetiraccetam tablets. The pharmacokinetics (AUC and C <span class="Sub">max</span>) were shown to be dose proportional after single dose administration of 1000 mg, 2000 mg, and 3000 mg extended-release levetiracetam. Plasma half-life of extended-release levetiracetam is approximately 7 hours.</p><p>Levetiracetam is almost completely absorbed after oral administration. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are linear and time-invariant, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Levetiracetam is not significantly protein-bound (&lt;10% bound) and its volume of distribution is close to the volume of intracellular and extracellular water. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the dose is renally excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathway of levetiracetam (24% of dose) is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. It is not liver cytochrome P450 dependent. The metabolites have no known pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. Plasma half-life of levetiracetam across studies is approximately 6 to 8 hours. The half-life is increased in the elderly (primarily due to impaired renal clearance) and in subjects with renal impairment.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption and Distribution</span><br/>
<br/>
Extended-release levetiracetam peak plasma concentrations occur in about 4 hours. The time to peak plasma concentrations is about 3 hours longer with extended-release levetiracetam than with immediate-release tablets.</p><p>Single administration of two 500 mg extended-release levetiracetam tablets once daily produced comparable maximal plasma concentrations and area under the plasma concentration versus time as did the administration of one 500 mg immediate-release tablet twice daily in fasting conditions. After multiple dose extended-release levetiracetam tablets intake, extent of exposure (AUC <span class="Sub">0-24</span>) was similar to extent of exposure after multiple dose immediate-release tablets intake. C <span class="Sub">max</span> and C <span class="Sub">min</span> were lower by 17% and 26% after multiple dose extended-release levetiracetam tablets intake in comparison to multiple dose immediate-release tablets intake. Intake of a high fat, high calorie breakfast before the administration of extended-release levetiracetam tablets resulted in a higher peak concentration, and longer median time to peak. The median time to peak (T <span class="Sub">max</span>) was 2 hours longer in the fed state.</p><p>Two 750 mg extended-release levetiracetam tablets were bioequivalent to a single administration of three 500 mg extended-release levetiracetam tablets.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span><br/>
<br/>
Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, which produces the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057 (24% of dose) and is not dependent on any liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The major metabolite is inactive in animal seizure models. Two minor metabolites were identified as the product of hydroxylation of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring (2% of dose) and opening of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring in position 5 (1% of dose). There is no enantiomeric interconversion of levetiracetam or its major metabolite.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span><br/>
<br/>
Levetiracetam plasma half-life in adults is 7±1 hour and is unaffected by either dose or repeated administration. Levetiracetam is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug which represents 66% of administered dose. The total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg and the renal clearance is 0.6 mL/min/kg. The mechanism of excretion is glomerular filtration with subsequent partial tubular reabsorption. The metabolite ucb L057 is excreted by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance of 4 mL/min/kg. Levetiracetam elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance. Levetiracetam clearance is reduced in patients with impaired renal function [ <span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Elderly</span><br/>
<br/>
There are insufficient pharmacokinetic data to specifically address the use of extended-release levetiracetam in the elderly population.</p><p>Pharmacokinetics of immediate-release levetiracetam were evaluated in 16 elderly subjects (age 61 to 88 years) with creatinine clearance ranging from 30 to 74 mL/min. Following oral administration of twice-daily dosing for 10 days, total body clearance decreased by 38% and the half-life was 2.5 hours longer in the elderly compared to healthy adults. This is most likely due to the decrease in renal function in these subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span><br/>
<br/>
An open label, multicenter, parallel-group, two-arm study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam extended-release tablets in pediatric patients (13 to 16 years old) and in adults (18 to 55 years old) with epilepsy. Levetiracetam extended-release oral tablets (1000 mg to 3000 mg) were administered once daily with a minimum of 4 days and a maximum of 7 days of treatment to 12 pediatric patients and 13 adults in the study. Dose-normalized steady-state exposure parameters, C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC, were comparable between pediatric and adult patients.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy</span><br/>
<br/>
Levetiracetam extended-release tablets levels may decrease during pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Gender</span><br/>
<br/>
Extended-release levetiracetam C <span class="Sub">max</span> was 21 to 30% higher and AUC was 8 to 18% higher in women (N=12) compared to men (N=12). However, clearances adjusted for body weight were comparable.</p><p><span class="Italics">Race</span><br/>
<br/>
Formal pharmacokinetic studies of the effects of race have not been conducted with extended-release or immediate-release levetiracetam. Cross study comparisons involving Caucasians (N=12) and Asians (N=12), however, show that pharmacokinetics of immediate-release levetiracetam were comparable between the two races. Because levetiracetam is primarily renally excreted and there are no important racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic differences due to race are not expected.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span><br/>
<br/>
The effect of levetiracetam extended-release tablets on renally impaired patients was not assessed in the controlled study. However, it is expected that the effect on levetiracetam extended-release tablets-treated patients would be similar to that seen in controlled studies of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets. In patients with end stage renal disease on dialysis, it is recommended that immediate-release levetiracetam be used instead of levetiracetam extended-release tablets.</p><p>The disposition of immediate-release levetiracetam was studied in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Total body clearance of levetiracetam is reduced in patients with impaired renal function by 40% in the mild group (CLcr = 50 to 80 mL/min), 50% in the moderate group (CLcr = 30 to 50 mL/min) and 60% in the severe renal impairment group (CLcr &lt;30 mL/min). Clearance of levetiracetam is correlated with creatinine clearance.</p><p>In anuric (end stage renal disease) patients, the total body clearance decreased 70% compared to normal subjects (CLcr &gt;80mL/min). Approximately 50% of the pool of levetiracetam in the body is removed during a standard 4-hour hemodialysis procedure [ <span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span><br/>
<br/>
In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were unchanged. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), total body clearance was 50% that of normal subjects, but decreased renal clearance accounted for most of the decrease. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic impairment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> data on metabolic interactions indicate that levetiracetam is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite, at concentrations well above C <span class="Sub">max</span> levels achieved within the therapeutic dose range, are neither inhibitors of, nor high affinity substrates for, human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms, epoxide hydrolase or UDP-glucuronidation enzymes. In addition, levetiracetam does not affect the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> glucuronidation of valproic acid.</p><p>Potential pharmacokinetic interactions of or with levetiracetam were assessed in clinical pharmacokinetic studies (phenytoin, valproate, warfarin, digoxin, oral contraceptive, probenecid) and through pharmacokinetic screening with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in the placebo-controlled clinical studies in epilepsy patients. The potential for drug interactions for levetiracetam extended-release tablets is expected to be essentially the same as that with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets.</p><p><span class="Italics">Phenytoin</span><br/>
<br/>
Immediate-release levetiracetam tablets (3,000 mg daily) had no effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of phenytoin in patients with refractory epilepsy. Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were also not affected by phenytoin.</p><p><span class="Italics">Valproate</span><br/>
<br/>
Immediate-release levetiracetam tablets (1,500 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of valproate in healthy volunteers. Valproate 500 mg twice daily did not modify the rate or extent of levetiracetam absorption or its plasma clearance or urinary excretion. There also was no effect on exposure to and the excretion of the primary metabolite, ucb L057.</p><p><span class="Italics">Other Antiepileptic Drugs</span><br/>
<br/>
Potential drug interactions between immediate-release levetiracetam tablets and other AEDs (carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone and valproate) were also assessed by evaluating the serum concentrations of levetiracetam and these AEDs during placebo-controlled clinical studies. These data indicate that levetiracetam does not influence the plasma concentration of other AEDs and that these AEDs do not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.</p><p><span class="Italics">Oral Contraceptives</span><br/>
<br/>
Immediate-release levetiracetam tablets (500 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel, or of the luteinizing hormone and progesterone levels, indicating that impairment of contraceptive efficacy is unlikely. Coadministration of this oral contraceptive did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.</p><p><span class="Italics">Digoxin</span><br/>
<br/>
Immediate-release levetiracetam tablets (1,000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (ECG) of digoxin given as a 0.25 mg dose every day. Coadministration of digoxin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.</p><p><span class="Italics">Warfarin</span><br/>
<br/>
Immediate-release levetiracetam tablets (1,000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of R and S warfarin. Prothrombin time was not affected by levetiracetam. Coadministration of warfarin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.</p><p><span class="Italics">Probenecid</span><br/>
<br/>
Probenecid, a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, administered at a dose of 500 mg four times a day, did not change the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam 1000 mg twice daily. C <span class="Sup">ss</span><span class="Sub">max</span> of the metabolite, ucb L057, was approximately doubled in the presence of probenecid while the fraction of drug excreted unchanged in the urine remained the same. Renal clearance of ucb L057 in the presence of probenecid decreased 60%, probably related to competitive inhibition of tubular secretion of ucb L057. The effect of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets on probenecid was not studied.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span><br/>
<br/>
Rats were dosed with levetiracetam in the diet for 104 weeks at doses of 50 mg/kg/day, 300 mg/kg/day and 1,800 mg/kg/day. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the highest dose was approximately 6 times that in humans at the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD) of 3,000 mg. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity. In mice, oral administration of levetiracetam for 80 weeks (doses up to 960 mg/kg/day) or 2 years (doses up to 4,000 mg/kg/day, lowered to 3,000 mg/kg/day after 45 weeks due to intolerability) was not associated with an increase in tumors. The highest dose tested in mice for 2 years (3000 mg/kg/day) is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a body surface area (mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>) basis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span><br/>
<br/>
Levetiracetam was negative in in vitro (Ames, chromosomal aberration in mammalian cells) and in vivo (mouse micronucleus) assays. The major human metabolite of levetiracetam (ucb L057) was negative in in vitro (Ames, mouse lymphoma) assays.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span><br/>
<br/>
No adverse effects on male or female fertility or reproductive performance were observed in rats at oral doses up to 1,800 mg/kg/day, which were associated with plasma exposures (AUC) up to approximately 6 times that in humans at the MRHD.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The effectiveness of levetiracetam extended-release tablets for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. This was supported by the demonstration of efficacy of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets (see below) in partial seizures in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in adults, as well as a demonstration of comparable bioavailability between the XR and immediate-release formulations [ <span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>] in adults. The effectiveness for levetiracetam extended-release tablets for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients, 12 years of age and older, was based upon a single pharmacokinetic study showing comparable pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam extended-release tablets in adults and adolescents [ <span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. All studies are described below.</p><h3>Levetiracetam Extended-Release Tablets in Adults</h3><p class="First">The effectiveness of levetiracetam extended-release tablets for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study across 7 countries in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization (Study 1).</p><p><span class="Bold">Study 1</span><br/>
<br/>
Patients enrolled in Study 1 had at least eight partial seizures with or without secondary generalization during the 8-week baseline period and at least two partial seizures in each 4-week interval of the baseline period. Patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one AED and could take a maximum of three AEDs. After a prospective baseline period of 8 weeks, 158 patients were randomized to placebo (N=79) or 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets) of levetiracetam extended-release tablets (N=79), given once daily over a 12-week treatment period.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint in Study 1 was the percent reduction over placebo in mean weekly frequency of partial-onset seizures. The median percent reduction in weekly partial-onset seizure frequency from baseline over the treatment period was 46.1% in the levetiracetam extended-release tablets 1,000 mg treatment group (N=74) and 33.4% in the placebo group (N=78). The estimated percent reduction over placebo in weekly partial-onset seizure frequency over the treatment period was 14.4% (statistically significant).</p><p>The relationship between the effectiveness of the same daily dose of levetiracetam extended-release tablets and immediate-release levetiracetam has not been studied and is unknown.</p><h3>Immediate-Release Levetiracetam in Adults</h3><p class="First">The effectiveness of immediate-release levetiracetam for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization (Studies 2, 3, and 4). The tablet formulation was used in all three studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to placebo, levetiracetam 1,000 mg, levetiracetam 2,000 mg, or levetiracetam 3,000 mg/day. Patients enrolled in Study 2 or Study 3 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study 4 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least 1 year and had taken one AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one AED and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.</p><p><span class="Bold">Study 2</span></p><p>Study 2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 41 sites in the United States, comparing immediate-release levetiracetam 1,000 mg/day (N=97), immediate-release levetiracetam 3,000 mg/day (N=101), and placebo (N=95), given in equally divided doses twice daily. After a prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients in Study 2 were randomized to one of the three treatment groups described above. The 18-week treatment period consisted of a 6-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED regimens were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness in Study 2 was a between-group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period).
