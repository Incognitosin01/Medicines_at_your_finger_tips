This medicine lowers blood sugar in three ways. It slows the rate that food moves from your stomach to your intestines, which keeps your blood sugar from rising too fast. This medicine also lowers the amount of glucose (sugar) your liver produces. Lastly, this medicine triggers the feeling of fullness after meals to help control your appetite and decrease how much food you eat.</p><p>SymlinPen 60 is used together with insulin to treat type 1 or type 2 diabetes. This medicine is usually given after other diabetes medicines have been tried without success.</p><p>SymlinPen 60 may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use  SymlinPen 60 if you have a digestive condition called "delayed gastric emptying."</p><p>You should not use SymlinPen 60 if you cannot recognize symptoms of low blood sugar.

Your doctor may occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results. When you first start using SymlinPen 60, your insulin dose will change. Do not use your medicines in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>SymlinPen 60 is injected under the skin, at the same time as your insulin injection but in a separate injection. Do not self-inject your medicines if you do not fully understand how to give the injections and properly dispose of used needles and syringes.</p><p><b>Do not mix SymlinPen 60 and insulin together in the same syringe.</b></p><p> SymlinPen 60 comes with patient instructions for safe and effective use. Follow these directions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>SymlinPen 60 is usually given just before each major meal. <b>If you skip a meal, you should also skip your this medicine dose.</b></p><p>Use a different place on your stomach or thigh each time you give the injection. Inject your insulin in a separate skin area. Do not inject insulin or SymlinPen 60 into the same place two times in a row.</p><p>Do not use SymlinPen 60 if it has changed colors or looks cloudy. Call your pharmacist for new medication.</p><p>Low blood sugar <b>(hypoglycemia)</b> can happen to everyone who has diabetes. Symptoms include headache, hunger, sweating, confusion, irritability, dizziness, or feeling shaky. Always keep a source of sugar with you in case you have low blood sugar. Sugar sources include fruit juice, hard candy, crackers, raisins, and non-diet soda. Be sure your family and close friends know how to help you in an emergency.</p><p>Take care not to let your blood sugar get too low. Severely low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) may occur within 3 hours after your SymlinPen 60 injection. If you have severe hypoglycemia and cannot eat or drink, use a glucagon injection. Your doctor can prescribe a glucagon emergency injection kit and tell you how to use it.</p><p>Also watch for signs of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) such as increased thirst, increased urination, hunger, dry mouth, fruity breath odor, drowsiness, dry skin, blurred vision, and weight loss.</p><p>Check your blood sugar carefully during times of stress, travel, illness, surgery or medical emergency, vigorous exercise, or if you drink alcohol or skip meals. These things can affect your glucose levels and your dose needs may also change. <b>Do not change your medication dose or schedule without your doctor's advice.</b></p><p>Use a disposable needle and syringe only once. Follow any state or local laws about throwing away used needles and syringes. Use a puncture-proof "sharps" disposal container (ask your pharmacist where to get one and how to throw it away). Keep this container out of the reach of children and pets.</p><p>Never share an injection pen with another person. Sharing injection pens can allow disease such as hepatitis or HIV to pass from one person to another.</p><p>Call your doctor if you have severe nausea that lasts for several days. This may be a sign that your dose is too high.</p><p>SymlinPen 60 is only part of a treatment program that also includes diet, exercise, weight control, regular blood sugar testing, and special medical care. Keep a regular schedule when using your injections and testing your blood sugar. It is also important to plan your meals and physical activity. You may not be able to keep using this medicine if you do not follow the dosing instructions.</p><p>If you stop using SymlinPen 60 for a short time, you may need to restart the medicine at a lower dose. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p><b>Storing unopened injection pens:</b> Keep in the carton and store in a refrigerator, protected from light. Throw away any SymlinPen 60 not used before the expiration date on the medicine label. <b>Do not freeze this medicine</b>, and throw away the medication if it has become frozen.</p><p>Take an injection pen out of the refrigerator and allow it to reach room temperature before injecting your dose. Do not remove SymlinPen 60 from an injector pen and put the medicine in a syringe. You may receive too high a dose.</p><p>Storing after your first use: You may keep "in-use" injection pens in the refrigerator or at room temperature. Use within 30 days.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, but only if you are getting ready to eat a meal. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.
