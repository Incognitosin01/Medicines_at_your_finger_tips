Oral budesonide formulations allow for targeted, pH-dependent budesonide release in the treatment of IBD (eg, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis). The controlled release capsule contains enteric coated granules that dissolve at a pH ≥5.5, delivering budesonide to the ileum and ascending colon. The multimatrix enteric coated tablet dissolves at a pH ≥7, delivering budesonide to the entire colon (Abdalla 2016; Iborra 2014).</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Children ≥9 years and Adolescents ≤14 years: IV: 2.2 ± 0.4 L/kg</p><p>Adults: 2.2 to 3.9 L/kg</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Hepatic via CYP3A4 to two metabolites: 16 alpha-hydroxyprednisolone and 6 beta-hydroxybudesonide; both are &lt;1% as active as parent</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (60%) and feces as metabolites</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Capsules: Children ≥9 years of age and adolescents ≤14 years of age: Median: 5 hours; Adults: 0.5 to 10 hours; Tablet (extended release): 13.3 ± 5.9 hours.</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Children ≥9 years of age and adolescents ≤14 years of age: IV: 1.9 hours.</p><p>Adults: IV: 2 to 3.6 hours; Capsule (delayed release): 6.3 ± 1.6 hours (range: 2 to 8 hours).</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>85% to 90%</p><h2>Special Populations: Hepatic Function Impairment</h2><p>Increased systemic exposure (≥2.5 fold) has been reported in moderate hepatic impairment.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Crohn disease, mild to moderate (capsules):</b> Treatment of active Crohn disease (mild to moderate) involving the ileum and/or the ascending colon in patients ≥8 years of age; maintenance of clinical remission (for up to 3 months) of Crohn disease (mild to moderate) involving the ileum and/or the ascending colon in adults</p><p><b>Ulcerative colitis (tablets):</b> Induction of remission in patients with active ulcerative colitis (mild to moderate)</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Eosinophilic esophagitis</h3><p>Data from controlled trials and meta-analyses indicate that budesonide inhalational suspension, compounded into a viscous suspension and swallowed rather than inhaled, is effective at improving the clinicopathologic features of eosinophilic esophagitis <sup>[Chuang 2015]</sup>, <sup>[Dohil 2010]</sup>, <sup>[Murali 2016]</sup>, <sup>[Straumann 2010]</sup>.</p><p>Guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology and consensus recommendations from the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute/North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition on the management of eosinophilic esophagitis recommend oral administration of inhalational corticosteroids (eg, fluticasone, budesonide) as first-line therapy in adults and children with eosinophilic esophagitis and that the corticosteroid type and duration of therapy be individualized.

HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis. Withdrawal and discontinuation of a corticosteroid should be done slowly and carefully. Particular care is required when patients are transferred from systemic corticosteroids to inhaled products or corticosteroids with lower systemic effect due to possible adrenal insufficiency or withdrawal from steroids, including an increase in allergic symptoms. Adult patients receiving &gt;20 mg per day of prednisone (or equivalent) may be most susceptible. Fatalities have occurred due to adrenal insufficiency in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to aerosol steroids; aerosol steroids do <b>not</b> provide the systemic steroid needed to treat patients having trauma, surgery, or infections.</p><p>• Anaphylactoid reactions: Rare cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been observed in patients receiving corticosteroids.</p><p>• Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may increase the incidence of secondary infection, mask acute infection (including fungal infections), prolong or exacerbate viral infections, or limit response to killed or inactivated vaccines. Exposure to chickenpox or measles should be avoided; corticosteroids should not be used to treat ocular herpes simplex. Corticosteroids should not be used for cerebral malaria, fungal infections, viral hepatitis. Close observation is required in patients with latent tuberculosis and/or tuberculosis (TB) reactivity; restrict use in active TB (only fulminating or disseminated TB in conjunction with antituberculosis treatment). Amebiasis should be ruled out in any patient with recent travel to tropic climates or unexplained diarrhea prior to initiation of corticosteroids. Use with extreme caution in patients with <i>Strongyloides</i> infections; hyperinfection, dissemination and fatalities have occurred.</p><p>• Kaposi sarcoma: Prolonged treatment with corticosteroids has been associated with the development of Kaposi sarcoma (case reports); if noted, discontinuation of therapy should be considered (Goedert 2002).</p><p>• Myopathy: Acute myopathy has been reported with high-dose corticosteroids, usually in patients with neuromuscular transmission disorders; may involve ocular and/or respiratory muscles; monitor creatine kinase; recovery may be delayed.</p><p>• Psychiatric disturbances: Corticosteroid use may cause psychiatric disturbances, including euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, severe depression or psychotic manifestations. Preexisting psychiatric conditions may be exacerbated by corticosteroid use.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with heart failure and/or hypertension; use has been associated with fluid retention, electrolyte disturbances, and hypertension. Use with caution following acute myocardial infarction; corticosteroids have been associated with myocardial rupture.</p><p>• Diabetes: Use corticosteroids with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus; may alter glucose production/regulation leading to hyperglycemia.</p><p>• Gastrointestinal disease: Use with caution in patients with GI diseases (diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, active or latent peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, abscess or other pyogenic infection) due to perforation risk.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Avoid use of ER capsules in moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B and C) and delayed release capsules in severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Consider reduced dosage of delayed release capsules in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B); monitor for hypercortisolism. Long-term use of corticosteroids in patients with hepatic impairment, including cirrhosis, has been associated with fluid retention.</p><p>• Myasthenia gravis: Use with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis; exacerbation of symptoms has occurred especially during initial treatment with corticosteroids.</p><p>• Ocular disease: Use with caution in patients with cataracts and/or glaucoma; increased intraocular pressure, open-angle glaucoma, and cataracts have occurred with prolonged use. Consider routine eye exams in chronic users.</p><p>• Osteoporosis: Use with caution in patients with osteoporosis; high doses and/or long-term use of corticosteroids have been associated with increased bone loss and osteoporotic fractures.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; fluid retention may occur.</p><p>• Seizure disorders: Use corticosteroids with caution in patients with a history of seizure disorder; seizures have been reported with adrenal crisis.</p><p>• Systemic sclerosis: Use with caution in patients with systemic sclerosis; an increase in scleroderma renal crisis incidence has been observed with corticosteroid use. Monitor BP and renal function in patients with systemic sclerosis treated with corticosteroids (EULAR [Kowal-Bielecka 2017]).</p><p>• Thyroid disease: Changes in thyroid status may necessitate dosage adjustments; metabolic clearance of corticosteroids increases in hyperthyroid patients and decreases in hypothyroid ones.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Serum glucose, electrolytes; blood pressure, weight and other growth parameters, presence of infection; monitor IOP with therapy &gt;6 weeks; bone mineral density; assess HPA axis suppression (eg, ACTH stimulation test, morning plasma cortisol test, urinary free cortisol test)</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Fertility may be decreased in females with active inflammatory bowel disease. Corticosteroids used for the management of inflammatory bowel disease are not expected to decrease female fertility (AGA [Mahadevan 2019]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Some studies have shown an association between first trimester systemic corticosteroid use and oral clefts (Park-Wyllie 2000; Pradat 2003). Systemic corticosteroids may also influence fetal growth (decreased birth weight); however, information is conflicting (Lunghi 2010). Hypoadrenalism may occur in newborns following maternal use of corticosteroids in pregnancy (monitor).</p><p>Because systemic corticosteroids may increase the risk of gestational diabetes and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, use for maintenance therapy in pregnant women with inflammatory bowel disease is not recommended. However, corticosteroids may be used to treat disease flares in pregnant patients (AGA [Mahadevan 2019]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
