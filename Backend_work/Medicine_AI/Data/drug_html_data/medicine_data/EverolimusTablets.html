Non-infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with Everolimus in clinical trials, some cases were reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension) as a secondary event. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4% and up to 0.2%, respectively <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions</span> (</span><span class="Italics">6.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Fatal outcomes have been observed.</p><p>Consider a diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Consider opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in the differential diagnosis. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms.</p><p>Continue Everolimus without dose alteration in patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms. Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis.</p><p>For Grade 2 to 4 non-infectious pneumonitis, withhold or permanently discontinue Everolimus based on severity <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.9)]</span>. Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose.</p><h3>Infections</h3><p class="First">Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, or PJP), and viral infections (e.g., reactivation of hepatitis B virus) have occurred. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, or resulting in multisystem organ failure) or fatal. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 infections was up to 10% and up to 3%, respectively.</p><p>Complete treatment of preexisting invasive fungal infections prior to starting treatment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Withhold or permanently discontinue Everolimus based on severity of infection <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.9)]</span>.</p><p>Administer prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required.</p><h3>Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions to Everolimus have been observed and include anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, chest pain, and angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)]</span>. The incidence of Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions was up to 1%. Permanently discontinue Everolimus for the development of clinically significant hypersensitivity.</p><h3>Angioedema with Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitors with Everolimus may be at increased risk for angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis of randomized double-blind oncology clinical trials, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking Everolimus with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor. Permanently discontinue Everolimus for angioedema.</p><h3>Stomatitis</h3><p class="First">Stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis, has occurred in patients treated with Everolimus at an incidence ranging from 44% to 78% across clinical trials. Grades 3-4 stomatitis was reported in 4% to 9% of patients <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Stomatitis most often occurs within the first 8 weeks of treatment. When starting Everolimus, initiating dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution as a swish and spit mouthwash reduces the incidence and severity of stomatitis <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. If stomatitis does occur, mouthwashes and/or other topical treatments are recommended. Avoid alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme- containing products, as they may exacerbate the condition. Do not administer antifungal agents, unless fungal infection has been diagnosed.</p><h3>Renal Failure</h3><p class="First">Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have occurred in patients taking Everolimus. Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking Everolimus <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 elevations of serum creatinine was up to 2% and up to 1%, respectively. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 proteinuria was up to 1% and up to 0.5%, respectively. Monitor renal function prior to starting Everolimus and annually thereafter. Monitor renal function at least every 6 months in patients who have additional risk factors for renal failure.</p><h3>Risk of Impaired Wound Healing</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway. Therefore, Everolimus has the potential to adversely affect wound healing.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Withhold Everolimus for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of treatment upon resolution of wound healing complications has not been established</span>.</p><h3>Metabolic Disorders</h3><p class="First">Hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in patients taking Everolimus at an incidence up to 75%, 86%, and 73%, respectively. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 15% and up to 0.4%, respectively <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. In non-diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose prior to starting Everolimus and annually thereafter. In diabetic patients, monitor fasting serum glucose more frequently as clinically indicated. Monitor lipid profile prior to starting Everolimus and annually thereafter. When possible, achieve optimal glucose and lipid control prior to starting Everolimus. For Grade 3 to 4 metabolic events, withhold or permanently discontinue Everolimus based on severity <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.9)]</span>.</p><h3>Myelosuppression</h3><p class="First">Anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients taking Everolimus. The incidence of these Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities was up to 16% and up to 2%, respectively <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Monitor complete blood count (CBC) prior to starting Everolimus every 6 months for the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. Withhold or permanently discontinue Everolimus based on severity <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics">Dosage and</span><span class="Italics">Administration (2.9)]</span>.</p><h3>Risk of Infection or Reduced Immune Response with Vaccination</h3><p class="First">The safety of immunization with live vaccines during Everolimus therapy has not been studied. Due to the potential increased risk of infection, avoid the use of live vaccines and close contact with individuals who have received live vaccines during treatment with Everolimus. Due to the potential increased risk of infection or reduced immune response with vaccination, complete the recommended childhood series of vaccinations according to American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines prior to the start of therapy. An accelerated vaccination schedule may be appropriate.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action, Everolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the clinical dose of 10 mg once daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use effective contraception during treatment with Everolimus and for 8 weeks after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Everolimus and for 4 weeks after the last dose <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to Everolimus (n=274) and placebo (n=137) in a randomized, controlled trial (RECORD-1) in patients with metastatic RCC who received prior treatment with sunitinib and/or sorafenib. The median age of patients was 61 years (27 to 85 years), 88% were white, and 78% were male. The median duration of blinded study treatment was 141 days (19 to 451 days) for patients receiving Everolimus.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥30%) were stomatitis, infections, asthenia, fatigue, cough, and diarrhea. The most common Grade 3 to 4 adverse reactions (incidence ≥3%) were infections, dyspnea, fatigue, stomatitis, dehydration, pneumonitis, abdominal pain, and asthenia. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence ≥50%) were anemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, and increased creatinine. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence ≥3%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypercholesterolemia.</p><p>Deaths due to acute respiratory failure (0.7%), infection (0.7%), and acute renal failure (0.4%) were observed on the Everolimus arm. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 14% for the Everolimus group. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were pneumonitis and dyspnea. Infections, stomatitis, and pneumonitis were the most common reasons for treatment delay or dose reduction. The most common medical interventions required during Everolimus treatment were for infections, anemia, and stomatitis.</p><p>Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of ≥ 10% for patients receiving Everolimus vs. placebo are presented in Table 12.

The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and/or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> studies.</p><p>Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 (<span class="Italics">TSC1, TSC2</span>). Loss or inactivation of either <span class="Italics">TSC1</span> or <span class="Italics">TSC2</span> leads to activation of downstream signaling. In TSC, a genetic disorder, inactivating mutations in either the <span class="Italics">TSC1</span> or the <span class="Italics">TSC2</span> gene lead to hamartoma formation throughout the body as well as seizures and epileptogenesis. Overactivation of mTOR results in neuronal dysplasia, aberrant axonogenesis and dendrite formation, increased excitatory synaptic currents, reduced myelination, and disruption of the cortical laminar structure causing abnormalities in neuronal development and function.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of Everolimus (20 mg and 50 mg) and placebo. Everolimus at single doses up to 50 mg did not prolong the QT/QTc interval.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>After administration of Everolimus Tablets in patients with advanced solid tumors, peak everolimus concentrations are reached 1 to 2 hours after administration of oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 70 mg. Following single doses, C<span class="Sub">max</span> is dose-proportional with daily dosing between 5 mg and 10 mg. With single doses of 20 mg and higher, the increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> is less than dose-proportional; however, AUC shows dose-proportionality over the 5 mg to 70 mg dose range. Steady-state was achieved within 2 weeks following once-daily dosing.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effect of Food</span>: In healthy subjects, a high-fat meal (containing approximately 1000 calories and 55 grams of fat) reduced systemic exposure to Everolimus 10 mg (as measured by AUC) by 22% and the peak blood concentration C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 54%. Light-fat meals (containing approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat) reduced AUC by 32% and C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 42%.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>The blood-to-plasma ratio of everolimus, which is concentration-dependent over the range of 5 to 5000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus confined to the plasma is approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer patients given Everolimus 10 mg orally once daily. Plasma protein binding is approximately 74% both in healthy subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.</p><p><span class="Italics">Elimination</span></p><p>The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is approximately 30 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span>:Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood. Six main metabolites of everolimus have been detected in human blood, including three monohydroxylated metabolites, two hydrolytic ring-opened products, and a phosphatidylcholine conjugate of everolimus. These metabolites were also identified in animal species used in toxicity studies, and showed approximately 100-times less activity than everolimus itself.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span>: No specific elimination studies have been undertaken in cancer patients. Following the administration of a 3 mg single dose of radiolabeled everolimus in patients who were receiving cyclosporine, 80% of the radioactivity was recovered from the feces, while 5% was excreted in the urine.

In a 13-week male fertility study in rats, testicular morphology was affected at doses of 0.5 mg/kg and above. Sperm motility, sperm count, and plasma testosterone levels were diminished in rats treated with 5 mg/kg. The exposures at these doses (52 ng•hr/mL and 414 ng•hr/mL, respectively) were within the range of human exposure at the recommended dose of Everolimus 10 mg orally once daily (560 ng●hr/mL) and resulted in infertility in the rats at 5 mg/kg. Effects on male fertility occurred at AUC<span class="Sub">0-24h</span> values 10% to 81% lower than human exposure at the recommended dose of Everolimus 10 mg orally once daily. After a 10 to 13 week non-treatment period, the fertility index increased from zero (infertility) to 60%.</p><p>Oral doses of everolimus in female rats at ≥0.1 mg/kg (approximately 4% the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended dose of Everolimus 10 mg orally once daily) resulted in increased incidence of pre-implantation loss, suggesting that the drug may reduce female fertility.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">In juvenile rat toxicity studies, dose-related delayed attainment of developmental landmarks including delayed eye-opening, delayed reproductive development in males and females and increased latency time during the learning and memory phases were observed at doses as low as 0.15 mg/kg/day.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)</h3><p class="First">An international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial (RECORD-1, NCT00410124) comparing Everolimus 10 mg once daily and placebo, both in conjunction with BSC, was conducted in patients with metastatic RCC whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with sunitinib, sorafenib, or both sequentially. Prior therapy with bevacizumab, interleukin 2, or interferon-α was also permitted. Randomization was stratified according to prognostic score and prior anticancer therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure for the trial was PFS evaluated by RECIST, based on a blinded, independent, central radiologic review. After documented radiological progression, patients randomized to placebo could receive open-label Everolimus. Other outcome measures included OS.</p><p>In total, 416 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive Everolimus (n=277) or placebo (n=139). Demographics were well balanced between the arms (median age 61 years; 77% male, 88% white, 74% received prior sunitinib or sorafenib, and 26% received both sequentially).</p><p>Everolimus was superior to placebo for PFS (Table 23 and Figure 4). The treatment effect was similar across prognostic scores and prior sorafenib and/or sunitinib. Final OS results yield a hazard ratio of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.14), with no statistically significant difference between the arms. Planned cross-over from placebo due to disease progression to open-label Everolimus occurred in 80% of the 139 patients and may have confounded the OS benefit.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Everolimus<br/>

The key eligibility requirements for this trial were at least one angiomyolipoma of ≥ 3 cm in longest diameter on CT/MRI based on local radiology assessment, no immediate indication for surgery, and age ≥ 18 years. Patients received Everolimus 10 mg or matching placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CT or MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks and annually thereafter. Clinical and photographic assessment of skin lesions were conducted at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. The major efficacy outcome measure was angiomyolipoma response rate based on independent central radiology review, which was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in angiomyolipoma volume, absence of new angiomyolipoma lesion ≥ 1 cm, absence of kidney volume increase ≥ 20%, and no angiomyolipoma related bleeding of ≥ Grade 2. Key supportive efficacy outcome measures were time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate. The primary analyses of efficacy outcome measures were limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The comparative angiomyolipoma response rate analysis was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no).</p><p>Of the 118 patients enrolled, 79 were randomized to Everolimus and 39 to placebo.

The median response duration was 5.3+ months (2.3+ to 19.6+ months).</p><p>There were 3 patients in the Everolimus arm and 8 patients in the placebo arm with documented angiomyolipoma progression by central radiologic review (defined as a ≥ 25% increase from nadir in the sum of angiomyolipoma target lesion volumes to a value greater than baseline, appearance of a new angiomyolipoma ≥ 1 cm in longest diameter, an increase in renal volume ≥ 20% from nadir for either kidney and to a value greater than baseline, or Grade ≥ 2 angiomyolipoma-related bleeding). The time to angiomyolipoma progression was statistically significantly longer in the Everolimus arm (HR 0.08 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.37]; p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 24: Angiomyolipoma Response Rate in TSC-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma in EXIST-2</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Everolimus</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 79</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 39</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">p-value</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Primary analysis</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Angiomyolipoma response rate</span>* –</p><p>% 95% CI</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">41.8</span></p><p>(30.8,53.4)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">0</span></p><p>(0.0,9.0)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">&lt;0.0001</span></p><p>Skin lesion response rates were assessed by local investigators for 77 patients in the Everolimus arm and 37 patients in the placebo arm who presented with skin lesions at study entry. The skin lesion response rate was statistically significantly higher in the Everolimus arm (26% vs. 0, p = 0.0011); all skin lesion responses were partial responses, defined as visual improvement in 50% to 99% of all skin lesions durable for at least 8 weeks (Physician's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition).</p><p>Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive Everolimus at the time of angiomyolipoma progression or after the time of the primary analysis. After the primary analysis, patients treated with Everolimus underwent additional follow-up CT or MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 112 patients (79 randomized to Everolimus and 33 randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of Everolimus. The median duration of Everolimus treatment was 3.9 years (0.5 months to 5.3 years) and the median duration of follow-up was 3.9 years (0.9 months to 5.4 years). During the follow-up period after the primary analysis, 32 patients (in addition to the 33 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis) had an angiomyolipoma response based upon independent central radiology review. Among the 65 responders out of 112 patients, the median time to angiomyolipoma response was 2.9 months (2.6 to 33.8 months). Fourteen percent of the 112 patients treated with Everolimus had angiomyolipoma progression by the end of the follow-up period. No patient underwent a nephrectomy for angiomyolipoma progression and one patient underwent renal embolization while treated with Everolimus.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Everolimus Tablets</span></p><p><span class="Bold">2.5 mg tablets are supplied as a white to off white, uniform to lightly speckled, capsule-shaped, flat-face, beveled edge tablet with “54 [space] 391” debossed on one side and plain on the other side.</span></p><p>NDC 0054-0480-13: Bottle of 30 Tablets</p><p>NDC 0054-0480-22: Bottle of 90 Tablets</p><p>NDC 0054-0480-14: Blister Pack of 28 Tablets</p><p><span class="Bold">5 mg tablets are supplied as a white to off white, uniform to lightly speckled, capsule-shaped, flat-face, beveled edge tablet with “54 [space] 451” debossed on one side and plain on the other side.</span></p><p>NDC 0054-0481-13: Bottle of 30 Tablets</p><p>NDC 0054-0481-22: Bottle of 90 Tablets</p><p>NDC 0054-0481-14: Blister Pack of 28 Tablets</p><p><span class="Bold">7.5 mg tablets are supplied as a white to off white, uniform to lightly speckled, capsule-shaped, flat-face, beveled edge tablet with “54 [space] 627” debossed on one side and plain on the other side.</span></p><p>NDC 0054-0497-13: Bottle of 30 Tablets <span class="Bold"><br/></span> NDC 0054-0497-22: Bottle of 90 Tablets</p><p>NDC 0054-0497-14: Blister Pack of 28 Tablets</p><p>Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F).
