The amount of this protein in your body may be reduced when you have kidney failure or use certain medications. When fewer red blood cells are produced, you can develop a condition called anemia.</p><p>Omontys is used to treat anemia (a lack of red blood cells in the body) in people with chronic kidney disease who are on dialysis.</p><p>Omontys is not for treating anemia caused by other conditions. This medicine is not for use in people who are not on dialysis.</p><p>Omontys may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Omontys if you are allergic to peginesatide, or if you have untreated or uncontrolled high blood pressure.</p><p>Before using Omontys, tell your doctor if you have heart disease, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, cancer, a seizure disorder, a blood cell or clotting disorder (such as sickle cell anemia or hemophilia), or a history of stroke, heart attack, or blood clot.</p><p>Your other medication doses may need to be changed after you start using Omontys.
