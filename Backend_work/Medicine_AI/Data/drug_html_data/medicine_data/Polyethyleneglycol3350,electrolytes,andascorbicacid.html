</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for polyethylene glycol 3350, electrolytes, and ascorbic acid</h2><p>The polyethylene glycol (PEG), electrolytes, and ascorbic acid combination is used to cleanse the colon (bowel) in preparation for a procedure called a colonoscopy.</p><p>MoviPrep® is a laxative. It works by causing you to have diarrhea to clean your colon. Cleaning your colon will help your doctor see inside of it more clearly during a colonoscopy.</p><p>Polyethylene glycol 3350, electrolytes, and ascorbic acid is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using polyethylene glycol 3350, electrolytes, and ascorbic acid</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For polyethylene glycol 3350, electrolytes, and ascorbic acid, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to polyethylene glycol 3350, electrolytes, and ascorbic acid or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of MoviPrep® in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of MoviPrep® in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, and unwanted effects (eg, fluid or electrolyte imbalance), which may require caution in patients receiving polyethylene glycol 3350, electrolytes, and ascorbic acid.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking polyethylene glycol 3350, electrolytes, and ascorbic acid, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using polyethylene glycol 3350, electrolytes, and ascorbic acid with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

You must read, understand, and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p><i>It is best if you do not eat any solid food before taking polyethylene glycol 3350, electrolytes, and ascorbic acid and until after your colonoscopy</i>.</p><p>You may drink clear liquids (eg, water, clear fruit juices (without pulp), strained limeade or lemonade, coffee or tea, broth, soda, gelatin, popsicles) before, during, and up until 2 hours before the time of your colonoscopy. <i>Do not eat or drink alcohol, milk, anything colored red or purple or containing pulp</i>. However, check first with your doctor.</p><p>You may have clear soup or plain yogurt for dinner on the evening that you start taking MoviPrep®. Dinner should be at least 1 hour before you take MoviPrep®.</p><p><i>To prepare the medicine</i>:</p><ul>
<li>The powder must be mixed with water before it is used. Add lukewarm water to the fill mark on the bottle. Do not add any other ingredients, such as flavoring, to the solution.</li>
<li>Shake well until all the ingredients are dissolved.</li>
<li>After you mix the solution, you must use it within 24 hours. You may refrigerate the solution before drinking.</li>
<li>You will need to drink 8 ounces (240 milliliters) of the mixed medicine about every 15 minutes until it is gone.</li>
<li>About 1 hour after you drink the first glass of liquid, you should have your first loose stool or mild diarrhea. This is how the medicine cleans out your bowels. You may have bloating or an upset stomach before the loose stools start.</li>
<li>If you cannot swallow the liquid, tell your doctor right away.</li>
</ul><p>You will need to consume 2 liters (about 64 ounces) of the oral solution and one additional liter (about 32 ounces) of clear liquid before the test. You may do one of the following ways:</p><ul>
<li>Split-dose (2-day regimen) method: The night before the test, drink the first liter of oral solution over 1 hour and then drink 0.5 liters (about 16 ounces) of clear liquid. Then, on the morning of the test, drink the second liter of the oral solution over 1 hour and then drink another 0.5 liters of clear liquid at least 2 hours before the test.</li>
<li>Evening-only (1-day regimen) method: The night (around 6 pm) before the test, drink the first liter of the oral solution over 1 hour. After about 1.5 hours, drink the second liter of the oral solution over one hour. Drink an additional liter of clear liquid the night before the test.</li>
<li>Do not eat or drink anything 2 hours before your colonoscopy, unless your doctor provides you with different instructions.</li>
</ul><p>Avoid taking other laxatives while you are using polyethylene glycol 3350, electrolytes, and ascorbic acid.</p><p><i>Do not take any oral medicine within 1 hour before using polyethylene glycol 3350, electrolytes, and ascorbic acid</i>.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of polyethylene glycol 3350, electrolytes, and ascorbic acid will be different for different patients.
