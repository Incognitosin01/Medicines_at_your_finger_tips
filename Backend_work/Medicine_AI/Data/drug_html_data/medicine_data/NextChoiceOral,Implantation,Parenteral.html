</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Next Choice</h2><p>Progestins are hormones.</p><p>The low-dose progestins for contraception are used to prevent pregnancy. Other names for progestin-only oral contraceptives are minipills and progestin-only pills (POPs). Progestins can prevent fertilization by preventing a woman's egg from fully developing.</p><p>Also, progestins cause changes at the opening of the uterus, such as thickening of the cervical mucus. This makes it hard for the partner's sperm to reach the egg. The fertilization of the woman's egg with her partner's sperm is less likely to occur while she is taking, receiving, or using a progestin, but it can occur. Even so, the progestins make it harder for the fertilized egg to become attached to the walls of the uterus, making it difficult to become pregnant.</p><p>No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. <i>Studies show that fewer than 1 of each 100 women become pregnant during the first year of use after correctly receiving the injection on time. Fewer than 10 of each 100 women who take progestins correctly by mouth for contraception become pregnant during the first year of use</i>. Methods that do not work as well include condoms, diaphragms, or spermicides. Discuss with your doctor what your options are for birth control.</p><p>Progestin contraceptives are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2>Importance of Diet</h2><p>Make certain your doctor knows if you are on any special diet, such as a low-sodium or low-sugar diet.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Next Choice</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Progestins have been used by teenagers and have not been shown to cause different side effects or problems than they do in adults. You must take progestin-only oral contraceptives every day in order for them to work. Progestins do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases, a risk factor for teenagers. It is not known if <i>Depo-Provera Contraceptive Injection</i> causes problems with bone development and growth in teenagers and young women. It is important that your doctor check you regularly for growth problems, especially if you have been using this medicine for 2 years or longer.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>This medicine has been tested and has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Use of progestin-only contraceptives during pregnancy is not recommended. Doctors should be told if pregnancy is suspected. When accidently used during pregnancy, progestins used for contraception have not caused problems.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Although progestins pass into the breast milk, the low doses of progestins used for contraception have not been shown to cause problems in nursing babies. Progestins used for contraception are recommended for nursing mothers when contraception is desired.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Next Choice</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain progestin contraceptives.  It may not be specific to Next Choice. Please read with care.</b></p><p>To make the use of a progestin as safe and reliable as possible, you should understand how and when to take it and what effects may be expected. Progestins for contraception usually come with patient directions. Read them carefully before taking or using this medicine.</p><p>Progestins do not protect a woman from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The use of latex (rubber) condoms or abstinence is recommended for protection from these diseases.</p><p><i>Take this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered</i>. To do so may increase the chance of side effects. Try to take the medicine at the same time each day to reduce the possibility of side effects and to allow it to work better.</p><p><i>When using levonorgestrel tablet dosage form for emergency contraception</i>:</p><ul>
<li>The tablets may be taken at any time during the menstrual cycle.</li>
</ul><p><i>When using medroxyprogesterone injection dosage form for contraception</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Your injection is given by a health care professional every 3 months.</li>
<li>To stop using medroxyprogesterone injection for contraception, simply do not have another injection.</li>
<li>Full protection from pregnancy begins immediately if you receive the first injection within the first 5 days of your menstrual period or within 5 days after delivering a baby if you will not be breast-feeding. If you are going to breast-feed, you may have to wait for 6 weeks from your delivery date before receiving your first injection. If you follow this schedule, you do not need to use another form of birth control. Protection from that one injection ends at 3 months. You will need another injection every 3 months to have full protection from becoming pregnant. However, if the injection is given later than 5 days from the first day of your last menstrual period, you will need to use another method of birth control as directed by your doctor.</li>
</ul><p><i>When using an oral progestin dosage form</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Take a tablet every 24 hours each day of the year. Taking the medicine at the same time each day helps to reduce the possibility of side effects and makes it work as expected. Taking your tablet 3 hours late is the same as missing a dose and can cause the medicine to not work properly.</li>
<li>Keep the tablets in the container in which you received them to help you to keep track of your dosage schedule.</li>
<li>When switching from estrogen and progestin oral contraceptives, you should take the first dose of the progestin-only contraceptive the next day after the last active pill of the estrogen and progestin oral contraceptive has been taken. This means you will not take the last 7 days (placebo or nonactive pills) of a 28-day cycle of the estrogen and progestin oral contraceptive pack. You will begin a new pack of progestin-only birth control pills on the 22nd day.</li>
<li>Also, when switching, full protection from pregnancy begins after 48 hours if the first dose of the progestin-only contraceptive is taken on the first day of the menstrual period. If the birth control is begun on other days, full protection may begin 3 weeks after you begin taking the medicine for the first time. You should use a second method of birth control for at least the first 3 weeks to ensure full protection. You are not fully protected if you miss pills. The chances of your getting pregnant are greater with each pill that is missed.</li>
</ul><p>Follow your doctor's orders to schedule the proper time to receive an injection of progestins for contraception.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>For levonorgestrel

</ul><h3>Missed dose</h3><p>Call your doctor or pharmacist for instructions.</p><p>For <i>oral</i> dosage form (tablets):</p><ul>
<li>When you miss 1 day's dose of oral tablets or are 3 hours or more late in taking your dose, many doctors recommend that you take the missed dose immediately, continue your normal schedule, and use another method of contraception for 2 days. This is different from what is done after a person misses a dose of birth control tablets that contain more than one hormone.</li>
</ul><p>For <i>injection</i> dosage form:</p><ul>
<li>If you miss having your next injection and it has been longer than 13 weeks since your last injection, your doctor may want you to stop receiving the medicine. Use another method of birth control until your period begins or until your doctor determines that you are not pregnant.</li>
<li>If your doctor has other directions, follow that advice. Any time you miss a menstrual period within 45 days after a missed or delayed dose you will need to be tested for a possible pregnancy.</li>
</ul><h3>Storage</h3><p>Keep out of the reach of children.</p><p>Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.</p><p>Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using Next Choice</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i>. This will allow your dosage to be adjusted to your changing needs, and will allow any unwanted effects to be detected. These visits are usually every 12 months when you are taking progestins by mouth for birth control.</p><ul>
<li>If you are receiving the medroxyprogesterone injection for contraception, a physical exam is needed only every 12 months, but you need an injection every 3 months. Your doctor will also want to check you for any bone development or growth problems, especially if you are a teenager or young adult.</li>
</ul><p><i>Progestins may cause dizziness in some people</i>. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert.</p><p>It is possible that certain doses of progestins may cause a temporary thinning of the bones by changing your hormone balance. It is important that your doctor know if you have an increased risk of osteoporosis. Some things that can increase your risk for osteoporosis include cigarette smoking, abusing alcohol, taking or drinking large amounts of caffeine, and having a family history of osteoporosis or easily broken bones. Some medicines, such as steroids (cortisone-like medicines) or anticonvulsants (seizure medicines), can also cause thinning of the bones. It is especially important that you tell your doctor about any of these risk factors if you are taking <i>Depo-Provera® Contraceptive Injection</i> or <i>Depo-SubQ Provera® 104</i>. These contraceptives may cause a loss of bone mineral density. Your doctor may replace these contraceptives with a different one.</p><p>Vaginal bleeding of various amounts may occur between your regular menstrual periods during the first 3 months of use. This is not unusual and does not mean you should stop the medicine. This is sometimes called spotting when the bleeding is slight, or breakthrough bleeding when it is heavier. If this occurs, continue on your regular dosing schedule. <i>Check with your doctor</i>:</p><ul>
<li>If vaginal bleeding continues for an unusually long time.</li>
<li>If your menstrual period has not started within 45 days of your last period.</li>
</ul><p>Missed menstrual periods may occur. <i>If you suspect a pregnancy, you should call your doctor immediately</i>.</p><p>If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your doctor that you are taking a progestin. Progestins can change certain test results.</p><p>The following medicines might reduce the effectiveness of progestins for contraception:</p><ul>
<li>Aminoglutethimide (e.g., Cytadren®)</li>
<li>Carbamazepine (e.g., Tegretol®)</li>
<li>Phenobarbital</li>
<li>Phenytoin (e.g., Dilantin®)</li>
<li>Rifabutin (e.g., Mycobutin®)</li>
<li>Rifampin (e.g., Rifadin®)</li>
</ul><p>Sometimes your doctor may use these medicines with progestins for contraception, but the doctor will give you special directions to follow to make sure your progestin is working properly. In order to prevent pregnancy, <i>use a second method of birth control</i> together with the progestin when you also use a medicine that could reduce the effectiveness of the progestin. If you are using medroxyprogesterone injection for contraception, continue using a back-up method of birth control until you have your next injection, even if the medicine that affects contraceptives is discontinued. If you are using the oral tablets, continue using a back-up method of birth control for a full cycle (or 4 weeks), even if the medicine that affects contraceptives is discontinued.</p><p>If you vomit your oral progestin-only contraceptive for any reason within a few hours after taking it, do not take another dose. Return to your regular dosing schedule and use an additional back-up method of birth control for 48 hours.</p><p>If you are receiving levonorgestrel tablets for emergency contraception and vomiting occurs within 1 hour after taking either dose of the medicine, contact your physician to discuss whether the dose should be repeated.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Next Choice side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:</p><p><i>More common</i></p><ul>
