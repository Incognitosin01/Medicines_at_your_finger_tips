</ul><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets or following a dose increase (see WARNINGS).</span></p><h3>Accidental Ingestion</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Accidental ingestion of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets (see WARNINGS).</span></p><h3>Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Other Risk Factors for Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Children</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine. Most of the reported cases occurred following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine due to a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 polymorphism (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers, Nursing Mothers). TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine is contraindicated in children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Avoid the use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS).</span></p><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Prolonged use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS).</span></p><h3>Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers, CYP3A4 inhibitors, or CYP2D6 inhibitors with codeine are complex. Use of CYP3A4 inducers, CYP3A4 inhibitors, or CYP2D6 inhibitors with TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, codeine, and the active metabolite, morphine (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions).</span></p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death.

</ul><h2>Tylenol with Codeine Description</h2><p class="First">TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine is supplied in tablet form for oral administration.</p><p>Acetaminophen, 4'-hydroxyacetanilide, a slightly bitter, white, odorless, crystalline powder, is a non-opiate, non-salicylate analgesic and antipyretic. It has the following structural formula:</p><p>Codeine phosphate, 7,8-didehydro-4, 5α-epoxy-3-methoxy-17-methylmorphinan-6α-ol phosphate (1:1) (salt) hemihydrate, a white crystalline powder, is a narcotic analgesic and antitussive. It has the following structural formula:</p><p>Each TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine No. 3 tablet, USP (300 mg/30 mg) contains:</p><p>Each TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine No. 4 tablet, USP (300 mg/60 mg) contains:</p><p>In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients:</p><p>TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine No. 3 contains powdered cellulose, magnesium stearate, sodium metabisulfite1, pregelatinized starch (corn), and modified starch (corn).</p><p>TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine No. 4 contains powdered cellulose, magnesium stearate, sodium metabisulfite1, pregelatinized starch (corn), and corn starch.</p><h2>Tylenol with Codeine - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Codeine is an opioid agonist relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, but with a much weaker affinity than morphine. The analgesic properties of codeine have been speculated to come from its conversion to morphine, although the exact mechanism of analgesic action remains unknown.</p><p>The precise mechanism of the analgesic properties of acetaminophen is not established but is thought to involve central actions.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Codeine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.</p><p>Codeine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p class="First">Codeine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p class="First">Codeine produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p class="First">Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>). They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS)</span>.</p><p class="First">Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.</p><p class="First">The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of codeine for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p class="First">There is a relationship between increasing codeine plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The behavior of the individual components is described below.</p><p class="First">Codeine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is rapidly distributed from the intravascular spaces to the various body tissues, with preferential uptake by parenchymatous organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidney. Codeine crosses the blood-brain barrier and is found in fetal tissue and breast milk. The plasma concentration does not correlate with brain concentration or relief of pain. Codeine is about 7–25% bound to plasma proteins and does not accumulate in body tissues.</p><p>About 70 to 80% of the administered dose of codeine is metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid to codeine-6-glucuronide (C6G) and via O-demethylation to morphine (about 5 to 10%) and N-demethylation to norcodeine (about 10%) respectively. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 and 2B4 are the major enzymes mediating glucuronidation of codeine to C6G. <span class="Bold">CYP</span>2D6 is the major enzyme responsible for conversion of codeine to morphine and CYP3A4 is the major enzyme mediating conversion of codeine to norcodeine. Morphine and norcodeine are further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid. The glucuronide metabolites of morphine are morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). Morphine and M6G are known to have analgesic activity in humans. The analgesic activity of C6G in humans is unknown. Norcodeine and M3G are generally not considered to possess analgesic properties.</p><p>The plasma half-life is about 2.9 hours. The elimination of codeine is primarily via the kidneys, and about 90% of an oral dose is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours of dosing. The urinary secretion products consist of free and glucuronide conjugated codeine (about 70%), free and conjugated norcodeine (about 10%), free and conjugated morphine (about 10%), normorphine (4%), and hydrocodone (1%). The remainder of the dose is excreted in the feces.</p><p>At therapeutic doses, the analgesic effect reaches a peak within 2 hours and persists between 4 and 6 hours.</p><p class="First">Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed throughout most body tissues. A small fraction (10–25%) of acetaminophen is bound to plasma proteins. The plasma half-life is 1.25 to 3 hours, but may be increased by liver damage and following overdosage. Elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism (conjugation) and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites. Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver by first-order kinetics and involves three principal separate pathways: conjugation with glucuronide; conjugation with sulfate; and oxidation via the cytochrome, P450-dependent, mixed-function oxidase enzyme pathway to form a reactive intermediate metabolite, which conjugates with glutathione and is then further metabolized to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates. The principal cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved appears to be CYP2E1, with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 as additional pathways. Approximately 85% of an oral dose appears in the urine within 24 hours of administration, most as the glucuronide conjugate, with small amounts of other conjugates and unchanged drug.</p><p>See <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span> for toxicity information.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Tylenol with Codeine</h2><p class="First">TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (acetaminophen and codeine phosphate) tablets are indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain, where treatment with an opioid is appropriate and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.</p><h3>Limitations of Use</h3><p class="First">Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, with opioids, even at recommended doses (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>), reserve TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics]</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Warnings</h2><h3>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</h3><p class="First">TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine contains codeine. Codeine in combination with acetaminophen, is a Schedule III controlled substance. As an opioid, TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse (see <span class="Bold">DRUG ABUSE and DEPENDENCE</span>).</p><p>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.</p><p>Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets, and monitor all patients receiving TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers</span>). Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><h3>Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)</h3><p class="First">To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.</li>
<li>Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG.</li>
<li>Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them.</li>
<li>Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities.</li>
</ul><p>To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com. The FDA Blueprint can be found at. www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status (see <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span>). Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24–72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine.</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine are essential (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). Overestimating the TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.</p><p>Accidental ingestion of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of codeine.</p><p>Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h3>Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Other Risk Factors for Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Children</h3><p class="First">Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine. Codeine is subject to variability in metabolism based upon CYP2D6 genotype (described below), which can lead to an increased exposure to the active metabolite morphine. Based upon post-marketing reports, children younger than 12 years of age appear to be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine, particularly if there are risk factors for respiratory depression. For example, many reported cases of death occurred in the post-operative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. Furthermore, children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine for post-tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to its respiratory depressant effects. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets are contraindicated for all children younger than 12 years of age (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</li>
<li>TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets are contraindicated for post-operative management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</li>
<li>Avoid the use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as post-operative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</li>
<li>As with adults, when prescribing codeine for adolescents, healthcare providers should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of morphine overdose (see <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span>).</li>
</ul><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">At least one death was reported in a nursing infant who was exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because the mother was an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets.</p><h3>CYP2D6 Genetic Variability: Ultra-Rapid Metabolizers</h3><p class="First">Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype (e.g., gene duplications denoted as *1/*1×N or *1/*2×N). The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 1 to 10% for Whites (European, North American), 3 to 4% for Blacks (African Americans), 1 to 2% for East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), and may be greater than 10% in certain racial/ethnic groups (i.e., Oceanian, Northern African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican). These individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels. Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression or experience signs of overdose (such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing) (see <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span>). Therefore, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers should not use TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets.</p><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Prolonged use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients/Caregivers, Pregnancy</span>).</p><h3>Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes</h3><p class="First">The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers, CYP3A4 inhibitors, or CYP2D6 inhibitors with codeine are complex. Use of CYP3A4 inducers, CYP3A4 inhibitors, or CYP2D6 inhibitors with TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, codeine, and the active metabolite, morphine.</p><p class="First">The concomitant use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine with all CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) or discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may result in an increase in codeine plasma concentrations with subsequently greater metabolism by CYP2D6, resulting in greater morphine levels, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.</p><p>The concomitant use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine with all CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in lower codeine levels, greater norcodeine levels, and less metabolism via CYP2D6 with resultant lower morphine levels. This may be associated with a decrease in efficacy, and in some patients, may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.</p><p>Follow patients receiving TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer for signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal when TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine are used in conjunction with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 (see WARNINGS; PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions).</p><p>If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary or if a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider dosage reduction of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.</p><p>If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inducer is necessary or if a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</span>).</p><p class="First">The concomitant use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine with all CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, quinidine) may result in an increase in codeine plasma concentrations and a decrease in active metabolite morphine plasma concentration which could result in an analgesic efficacy reduction or symptoms of opioid withdrawal.</p><p>Discontinuation of a concomitantly used CYP2D6 inhibitor may result in a decrease in codeine plasma concentration and an increase in active metabolite morphine plasma concentration which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.</p><p>Follow patients receiving TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine and any CYP2D6 inhibitor for signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal when TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets are used in conjunction with inhibitors of CYP2D6.</p><p>If concomitant use with a CYP2D6 inhibitor is necessary, follow the patient for signs of reduced efficacy or opioid withdrawal and consider increasing the TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine dosage. After stopping use of a CYP2D6 inhibitor, consider reducing the TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine dosage and follow the patient for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression or sedation (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions</span>).</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products.</p><p>The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.</p><p>Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.</p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First">Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions</span>).</p><p>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions, Information for Patients/Caregivers</span>).</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</h3><p class="First">The use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</p><p class="First">TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially compromised respiratory function, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</span>).</p><p class="First">Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics, including clearance, compared to younger, healthier patients (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</span>).</p><p>Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets and when TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</span>). Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.</p><h3>Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may potentiate the effects of morphine, codeine's active metabolite, including respiratory depression, coma, and confusion. TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.</p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than 1 month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><h3>Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First">TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions</span>). Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine. In patients with circulatory shock TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets may cause vasodilatation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets with circulatory shock.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness</h3><p class="First">In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets.</p><p>Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity/Anaphylaxis</h3><p class="First">There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with the use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, pruritus, and vomiting. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical attention. Instruct patients to discontinue TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine immediately and seek medical care if they experience these symptoms. Do not prescribe TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets for patients with acetaminophen allergy (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers</span>).</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First">TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>The administration of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets or other opioids may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><p>TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>Sulfite Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets contain sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</h3><p class="First">The codeine in TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets therapy.</p><h3>Withdrawal</h3><p class="First">Do not abruptly discontinue TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION, DRUG ABUSE and DEPENDENCE</span>).</p><p>Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions</span>).</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (acetaminophen and codeine phosphate) tablets should be prescribed with caution in certain special-risk patients with severe impairment of renal or hepatic function, convulsive disorders, obstructive airways disease, acute abdominal conditions such as obstructive bowel disorders (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS - Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions), hypothyroidism, urethral stricture, Addison’s disease, or prostatic hypertrophy</span>.</p><h3>Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery</h3><p class="First">TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets and know how they will react to the medication (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers</span>).</p><h3>Information for Patients/Caregivers</h3><p class="First">Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).</p><p class="First">Because of the risks associated with accidental ingestion, misuse, and abuse, advise patients to store TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets securely, out of sight and reach of children, and in a location not accessible by others, including visitors to the home (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</span>). Inform patients that leaving TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets unsecured can pose a deadly risk to others in the home.</p><p>Advise patients and caregivers that when medicines are no longer needed, they should be disposed of promptly. Inform patients that drug take-back options are the preferred way to safely dispose of most types of unneeded medicines. If no take back programs or Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)-registered collectors are available, instruct patients to dispose of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets by following these four steps:</p><ul class="Disc">

As no studies have been performed evaluating the short term use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine in patients on oral anticoagulants, more frequent assessment of INR may be appropriate in such circumstances.</p><p class="First">Codeine is metabolized by CYP2D6 to form morphine. The concomitant use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine and CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, bupropion, quinidine) can increase the plasma concentration of codeine, but can decrease the plasma concentration of active metabolite morphine, which could result in reduced analgesic efficacy or symptoms of opioid withdrawal, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine is achieved (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>).</p><p>After stopping a CYP2D6 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the codeine plasma concentration will decrease but the active metabolite morphine plasma concentration will increase, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>).</p><p>If concomitant use with a CYP2D6 inhibitor is necessary, or if a CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued after concomitant use, consider dosage adjustment of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine and monitor patients closely at frequent intervals.</p><p>If concomitant use with CYP2D6 inhibitors is necessary, follow the patient for reduced efficacy or signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and consider increasing the dosage of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine as needed.</p><p>After stopping use of a CYP2D6 inhibitor, consider reducing the dosage of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine and monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression or sedation.</p><p class="First">The concomitant use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets and CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may result in an increase in codeine plasma concentrations, with subsequently greater metabolism by CYP2D6, resulting in greater morphine levels, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine is achieved (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, it may result in lower codeine levels, greater norcodeine levels, and less metabolism via CYP2D6 with resultant lower morphine levels (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>), resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to codeine.</p><p>If concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary, consider dosage reduction of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine until stable drug effects are achieved.

There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in male and female rats, respectively, at dietary doses up to 70 and 80 mg/kg/day of codeine sulfate (approximately 2 times the maximum recommended daily dose of 360 mg/day for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) for two years. Similarly there was no evidence of carcinogenicity activity in male and female mice at dietary doses up to 400 mg/kg/day of codeine sulfate (approximately 5 times the maximum recommended daily dose of 360 mg/day for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) for two years.</p><p>Long-term studies in mice and rats have been completed by the National Toxicology Program to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of acetaminophen. In 2-year feeding studies, F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were fed a diet containing acetaminophen up to 6000 ppm. Female rats demonstrated equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia at 0.8 times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD) of 4 grams/day, based on a body surface area comparison. In contrast, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in male rats that received up to 0.7 times or mice at up to 1.2–1.4 times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison.</p><p class="First">Codeine sulfate was not mutagenic in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> bacterial reverse mutation assay or clastogenic in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosome aberration assay.</p><p>In the published literature, acetaminophen has been reported to be clastogenic when administered at 1500 mg/kg/day to the rat model (3.6-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison). In contrast, no clastogenicity was noted at a dose of 750 mg/kg/day (1.8-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison), suggesting a threshold effect.</p><p class="First">No nonclinical fertility studies have been conducted with codeine or the combination of codeine and acetaminophen.</p><p>In studies conducted by the National Toxicology Program, fertility assessments with acetaminophen have been completed in Swiss CD-1 mice via a continuous breeding study. There were no effects on fertility parameters in mice consuming up to 1.7 times the MHDD of acetaminophen, based on a body surface area comparison. Although there was no effect on sperm motility or sperm density in the epididymis, there was a significant increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm in mice consuming 1.78 times the MHDD (based on a body surface comparison) and there was a reduction in the number of mating pairs producing a fifth litter at this dose, suggesting the potential for cumulative toxicity with chronic administration of acetaminophen near the upper limit of daily dosing.</p><p>Published studies in rodents report that oral acetaminophen treatment of male animals at doses that are 1.2 times the MHDD and greater (based on a body surface comparison) result in decreased testicular weights, reduced spermatogenesis, reduced fertility, and reduced implantation sites in females given the same doses. These effects appear to increase with the duration of treatment. The clinical significance of these findings is not known.</p><p class="First">Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>).</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">A study in rats and rabbits reported no teratogenic effect of codeine administered during the period of organogenesis in doses ranging from 5 to 120 mg/kg. In the rat, doses at the 120 mg/kg level, in the toxic range for the adult animal, were associated with an increase in embryo resorption at the time of implantation. In another study a single 100 mg/kg subcutaneous dose of codeine administered to pregnant mice reportedly resulted in delayed ossification in the offspring.</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p class="First">Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth.</p><p>Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><h3>Labor or Delivery</h3><p class="First">Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine, and can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</p><p>Narcotic analgesics should be avoided during labor if delivery of a premature infant is anticipated. If the mother has received narcotic analgesics during labor, newborn infants should be observed closely for signs of respiratory depression. Resuscitation may be required (see <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span>). The effect of codeine, if any, on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child is unknown.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Codeine and its active metabolite, morphine, are present in human milk. There are published studies and cases that have reported excessive sedation, respiratory depression, and death in infants exposed to codeine via breast milk. Women who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine achieve higher than expected serum levels of morphine, potentially leading to higher levels of morphine in breast milk that can be dangerous in their breastfed infants. In women with normal codeine metabolism (normal CYP2D6 activity), the amount of codeine secreted into human milk is low and dose-dependent.</p><p>There is no information on the effects of codeine on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation, respiratory depression, and death in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>Limited published studies report that acetaminophen passes rapidly into human milk with similar levels in the milk and plasma. Average and maximum neonatal doses of 1% and 2%, respectively, of the weight-adjusted maternal dose are reported after a single oral administration of 1 gram APAP. There is one well documented report of rash in a breast-fed infant that resolved when the mother stopped acetaminophen use and recurred when she resumed acetaminophen use.</p><p class="First">If infants are exposed to TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets through breast milk, they should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established.</p><p>Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). In most of the reported cases, these events followed tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine (i.e., multiple copies of the gene for CYP2D6 or high morphine concentrations). Children with sleep apnea may be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine.</p><p>Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets are contraindicated for all children younger than 12 years of age (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</li>
<li>TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets are contraindicated for post-operative management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</li>
<li>Avoid the use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as post-operative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</li>
</ul><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system depression (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>These drugs are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><p>The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Serious adverse reactions associated with codeine are respiratory depression and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest.</p><p>The most frequently observed adverse reactions with codeine administration include drowsiness, lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, sweating, dry mouth, hyperhidrosis, headache and constipation.</p><p>Other adverse reactions include allergic reactions (including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema), transaminases increased, agitation, flushing, euphoria, dysphoria, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, pruritus, rash, urticaria, thrombocytopenia, and agranulocytosis.</p><p>Other less frequently observed adverse reactions expected from opioid analgesics, including TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine:</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular system</span>: faintness, flushing, hypotension, palpitations, syncope.</p><p><span class="Italics">Digestive System</span>: abdominal cramps, anorexia, diarrhea, dry mouth, gastrointestinal distress, pancreatitis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous system</span>: anxiety, drowsiness, fatigue, headache, insomnia, nervousness, shakiness, somnolence, vertigo, visual disturbances, weakness.</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Appendages</span>: fixed eruption, rash, sweating, urticaria.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Bold">Serotonin syndrome</span>: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Adrenal insufficiency</span>: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.</li>

</ul><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets contain codeine. Codeine in combination with acetaminophen, is a Schedule III controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets contain codeine, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids, including fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p><p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful, or potentially harmful, consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</p><p>"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care providers. "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p class="First">Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets are for oral use only. Abuse of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p><p>Physical dependence is a physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after a period of regular exposure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</p><p>Do not abruptly discontinue TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.</p><p>When discontinuing TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient specific plan that considers the following: the dose of the TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>, <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy</span>).</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Following an acute overdosage, toxicity may result from codeine or acetaminophen.</p><h3>Clinical Presentation</h3><p class="First">Acute overdosage with codeine can be manifested by respiratory depression, cardiorespiratory arrest, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, confusional state, cerebral edema, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, ileus, renal failure, vomiting and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p class="First">Dose-dependent, potentially fatal hepatic necrosis is the most serious adverse effect of acetaminophen overdose. Renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma, and coagulation defects may also occur.</p><p>Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose may include; anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, pallor and general malaise. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post-ingestion.</p><h3>Treatment of Overdose</h3><p class="First">In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or serious arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to codeine overdose.</p><p>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of codeine in TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information.</p><p>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p><p class="First">Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained immediately if the patient presents 4 hours or more after ingestion to assess potential risk of hepatotoxicity; acetaminophen levels drawn less than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading. To obtain the best possible outcome, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) should be administered as soon as possible where impending or evolving liver injury is suspected. Intravenous NAC may be administered when circumstances preclude oral administration. Vigorous supportive therapy is required in severe intoxication. Procedures to limit the continuing absorption of the drug must be readily performed since the hepatic injury is dose-dependent and occurs early in the course of intoxication.</p><h2>Tylenol with Codeine Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24–72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><h3>Initial Dosage</h3><p class="First">Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of pain and response of the patient. However, it should be kept in mind that tolerance to codeine can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. Adult doses of codeine higher than 60 mg are associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions and are not associated with greater efficacy.</p><p>The usual adult dosage is:</p><p>TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine Tablets (codeine 30 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg): Take 1 to 2 tablets every 4 hours as needed for pain.</p><p>TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine Tablets (codeine 60 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg): Take one tablet every 4 hours as needed for pain.</p><p>The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours, based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.</p><p class="First">There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.</p><h3>Titration and Maintenance of Therapy</h3><p class="First">Individually titrate TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.</p><p>If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.</p><h3>Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of TYLENOL® with Codeine</h3><p class="First">Do not abruptly discontinue TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.</p><p>When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.</p><p>There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.</p><p>It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.</p><p>When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS/Withdrawal, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</span>).</p><h2>How is Tylenol with Codeine Supplied</h2><p class="First">TYLENOL<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (acetaminophen and codeine phosphate) No. 3 Tablets contain acetaminophen 300 mg and codeine phosphate 30 mg.
