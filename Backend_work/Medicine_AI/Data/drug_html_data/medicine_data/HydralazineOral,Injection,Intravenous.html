It is also used to control high blood pressure in a mother during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia or eclampsia) or in emergency situations when blood pressure is extremely high (hypertensive crisis).</p><p>High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can decrease the risk of heart attacks and strokes.</p><p>Hydralazine works by relaxing the blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload.</p><p>Hydralazine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using hydralazine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For hydralazine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to hydralazine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of hydralazine have not been performed in the pediatric population. However, no pediatric-specific problems have been documented to date.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of hydralazine in geriatric patients.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using hydralazine with any of the following may cause an increased risk of certain side effects but may be unavoidable in some cases. If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use hydralazine, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of hydralazine</h2><p><i>Take hydralazine exactly as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not take more or less of it, and do not take it more often than your doctor ordered. Your dose may need to be changed several times in order to find out what works best for you.</p><p>In addition to the use of hydralazine, treatment for your high blood pressure may include weight control and changes in the types of foods you eat, especially foods high in sodium (salt). Your doctor will tell you which of these are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet.</p><p>Many patients who have high blood pressure will not notice any signs of the problem. In fact, many may feel normal. It is very important that you <i>take your medicine exactly as directed</i> and that you keep your appointments with your doctor even if you feel well.</p><p>Remember that hydralazine will not cure your high blood pressure, but it does help control it. You must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. <i>You may have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life</i>. If high blood pressure is not treated, it can cause serious problems such as heart failure, blood vessel disease, stroke, or kidney disease.</p><p>It is best to take your medicine on an empty stomach, 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.</p><p>For patients taking the <i>oral liquid</i>:</p><ul>
