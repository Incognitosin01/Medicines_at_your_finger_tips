Low levels of dopamine in the brain are associated with Parkinson's disease.</p><p>Neupro skin patches are used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as stiffness, tremors, muscle spasms, and poor muscle control.</p><p>Neupro is also used to treat restless legs syndrome (RLS).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Some people using Neupro have fallen asleep during normal daytime activities such as working, talking, eating, or driving. You may fall asleep suddenly, even after feeling alert. Tell your doctor if you have any problems with daytime sleepiness or drowsiness. If you are unsure of how rotigotine will affect you, be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be awake and alert.</p><p>You may have increased sexual urges, unusual urges to gamble, or other intense urges while taking this medication. Talk with your doctor if you believe you have any intense or unusual urges while using Neupro.</p><p>Do not stop using Neupro suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to avoid withdrawal symptoms when you stop using Neupro. Cold or allergy medicine, narcotic pain medicine, sleeping pills, muscle relaxers, and medicine for seizures, depression or anxiety can add to sleepiness caused by rotigotine. Tell your doctor if you regularly use any of these other medicines. Drinking alcohol can increase certain side effects of rotigotine. The Neupro patch may burn your skin if you wear the patch during an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Remove the patch before undergoing such a test. Neupro may cause hallucinations (the sensation of hearing or seeing something that is not there), most commonly among elderly people. Call your doctor if you have hallucinations.</p><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package. Tell each of your healthcare providers about all your medical conditions, allergies, and all medicines you use.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Neupro if you are allergic to rotigotine.</p><p>To make sure Neupro is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
