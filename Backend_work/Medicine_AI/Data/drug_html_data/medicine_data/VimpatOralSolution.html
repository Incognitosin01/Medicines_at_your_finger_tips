</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Vimpat Oral Solution</h2><p class="First">VIMPAT is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 4 years of age and older.</p><p>As the safety of VIMPAT injection in pediatric patients has not been established, VIMPAT injection is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures only in adult patients (17 years of age and older).</p><h2>Vimpat Oral Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage Information</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Monotherapy and Adjunctive Therapy</span></p><p>The recommended dosage for adults and pediatric patients 4 years to less than 17 years of age is included in Table 1. In pediatric patients 4 years to less than 17 years of age, the recommended dosing regimen is dependent upon body weight and is only recommended to be administered orally. Dosage should be increased based on clinical response and tolerability, no more frequently than once per week. Titration increments should not exceed those shown in Table 1.</p><p>In adjunctive clinical trials in adult patients, a dosage higher than 200 mg twice daily (400 mg per day) was not more effective and was associated with a substantially higher rate of adverse reactions [ <span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">VIMPAT Injection Dosage in Adult Patients (17 years and older)</span></p><p>VIMPAT injection may be used for adult patients when oral administration is temporarily not feasible [ <span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>] <span class="Italics">.</span> VIMPAT injection can be administered intravenously to adult patients with the same dosing regimens described for oral dosing, including the loading dose. The use of VIMPAT injection in pediatric patients has not been studied.</p><p>The clinical study experience of intravenous VIMPAT is limited to 5 days of consecutive treatment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Loading Dose in Adult Patients (17 Years and Older)</span></p><p>VIMPAT and VIMPAT injection may be initiated in adult patients with a single loading dose of 200 mg, followed approximately 12 hours later by 100 mg twice daily (200 mg per day). This maintenance dose regimen should be continued for one week. VIMPAT can then be titrated as recommended in Table 1. The adult loading dose should be administered with medical supervision because of the increased incidence of CNS adverse reactions [ <span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p>The use of a loading dose in pediatric patients has not been studied.</p><h3>Converting From a Single Antiepileptic (AED) to VIMPAT Monotherapy</h3><p class="First">For patients who are already on a single AED and will convert to VIMPAT monotherapy, withdrawal of the concomitant AED should not occur until the therapeutic dosage of VIMPAT is achieved and has been administered for at least 3 days. A gradual withdrawal of the concomitant AED over at least 6 weeks is recommended.</p><h3>Dosage Information for Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">For patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, no dosage adjustment is necessary.</p><p>For patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CL <span class="Sub">CR</span>) less than 30 mL/min as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation for adults; CL <span class="Sub">CR</span> less than 30 mL/min/1.73m <span class="Sup">2</span> as estimated by the Schwartz equation for pediatric patients] or end-stage renal disease, a reduction of 25% of the maximum dosage is recommended.</p><p>In all patients with renal impairment, the dose titration should be performed with caution.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hemodialysis</span></p><p>VIMPAT is effectively removed from plasma by hemodialysis. Following a 4-hour hemodialysis treatment, dosage supplementation of up to 50% should be considered.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 Inhibitors</span></p><p>Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with renal impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 [ <span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Dosage Information for Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">For patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, a reduction of 25% of the maximum dosage is recommended. The dose titration should be performed with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.</p><p>VIMPAT use is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 Inhibitors</span></p><p>Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with hepatic impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 [ <span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Administration Instructions for Vimpat Oral Solution</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">VIMPAT tablets and oral solution may be taken with or without food.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vimpat Oral Solution</span></p><p>A calibrated measuring device is recommended to measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device.</p><p>Vimpat Oral Solution may also be administered using a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube.</p><p>Discard any unused Vimpat Oral Solution remaining after 7 weeks of first opening the bottle.</p><h3>Discontinuation of VIMPAT</h3><p class="First">When discontinuing VIMPAT, a gradual withdrawal over at least 1 week is recommended [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span>].</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vimpat Oral Solution</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>10 mg/mL: clear, colorless to yellow or yellow-brown, strawberry-flavored liquid</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None <span class="Italics">.</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</h3><p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including VIMPAT, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p><p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p><p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p><p>Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p><p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar.</p><p>Anyone considering prescribing VIMPAT or any other AED must balance this risk with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which antiepileptics are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p><h3>Dizziness and Ataxia</h3><p class="First">VIMPAT may cause dizziness and ataxia. In adult patients with partial-onset seizures taking 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs, dizziness was experienced by 25% of patients randomized to the recommended doses (200 to 400 mg/day) of VIMPAT (compared with 8% of placebo patients) and was the adverse event most frequently leading to discontinuation (3%). Ataxia was experienced by 6% of patients randomized to the recommended doses (200 to 400 mg/day) of VIMPAT (compared to 2% of placebo patients). The onset of dizziness and ataxia was most commonly observed during titration. There was a substantial increase in these adverse events at doses higher than 400 mg/day [ <span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>]. Dizziness and ataxia were also observed in pediatric clinical trials.</p><h3>Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">PR Interval Prolongation, Atrioventricular Block, and Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Dose-dependent prolongations in PR interval with VIMPAT have been observed in clinical studies in adult patients and in healthy volunteers [ <span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</span>]. In adjunctive clinical trials in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block was observed as an adverse reaction in 0.4% (4/944) of patients randomized to receive VIMPAT and 0% (0/364) of patients randomized to receive placebo. One case of profound bradycardia was observed in a patient during a 15-minute infusion of 150 mg VIMPAT. When VIMPAT is given with other drugs that prolong the PR interval, further PR prolongation is possible.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">In the postmarketing setting, there have been reports of cardiac arrhythmias in patients treated with VIMPAT, including bradycardia, AV block, and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, which have rarely resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Most, although not all, cases have occurred in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions, or in those taking concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction or prolong the PR interval. These events have occurred with both oral and intravenous routes of administration and at prescribed doses as well as in the setting of overdose [ <span class="Italics">see Overdosage (10)</span>].</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">VIMPAT should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as known cardiac conduction problems (e.g., marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker), severe cardiac disease (such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure, or structural heart disease), and cardiac sodium channelopathies (e.g., Brugada Syndrome). VIMPAT should also be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction, including sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers, and medications that prolong the PR interval [ <span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.2)</span>] <span class="Italics">.</span> In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning VIMPAT, and after VIMPAT is titrated to steady-state maintenance dose, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered VIMPAT through the intravenous route [ <span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7.2)</span>].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter</span></p><p>In the short-term investigational trials of VIMPAT in adult patients with partial-onset seizures there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in open label partial-onset seizure trials and in postmarketing experience. In adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which VIMPAT is not indicated, 0.5% of patients treated with VIMPAT experienced an adverse reaction of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. VIMPAT administration may predispose to atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or flutter), especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or cardiovascular disease.</p><h3>Syncope</h3><p class="First">In the short-term controlled trials of VIMPAT in adult patients with partial-onset seizures with no significant system illnesses, there was no increase in syncope compared to placebo. In the short-term controlled trials in adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which VIMPAT is not indicated, 1.2% of patients who were treated with VIMPAT reported an adverse reaction of syncope or loss of consciousness, compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients with diabetic neuropathy. Most of the cases of syncope were observed in patients receiving doses above 400 mg/day. The cause of syncope was not determined in most cases. However, several were associated with either changes in orthostatic blood pressure, atrial flutter/fibrillation (and associated tachycardia), or bradycardia. Cases of syncope have also been observed in open-label clinical partial-onset seizure studies in adult and pediatric patients. These cases were associated with a history of risk factors for cardiac disease and the use of drugs that slow AV conduction.</p><h3>Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)</h3><p class="First">As with all AEDs, VIMPAT should be withdrawn gradually (over a minimum of 1 week) to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders.</p><h3>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including VIMPAT. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. VIMPAT should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.</p><h3>Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria</h3><p class="First">Phenylalanine can be harmful in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Vimpat Oral Solution contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. A 200 mg dose of Vimpat Oral Solution (equivalent to 20 mL) contains 0.32 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing Vimpat Oral Solution to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including Vimpat Oral Solution.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]</li>
<li>Dizziness and Ataxia [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]</li>
<li>Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>]</li>

<li>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span>]</li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">VIMPAT Tablet and Oral Solution</span></p><p>In the premarketing development of adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures, 1327 adult patients received VIMPAT tablets in controlled and uncontrolled trials, of whom 1000 were treated for longer than 6 months, and 852 for longer than 12 months. The monotherapy development program included 425 adult patients, 310 of whom were treated for longer than 6 months, and 254 for longer than 12 months.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Monotherapy Historical-Control Trial (Study 1)</span></p><p>In the monotherapy trial, 16% of patients randomized to receive VIMPAT at the recommended doses of 300 and 400 mg/day discontinued from the trial as a result of an adverse reaction. The adverse reaction most commonly (≥1% on VIMPAT) leading to discontinuation was dizziness.</p><p>Adverse reactions that occurred in this study were generally similar to those that occurred in adjunctive placebo-controlled studies. One adverse reaction, insomnia, occurred at a rate of ≥2% and was not reported at a similar rate in previous studies. This adverse reaction has also been observed in postmarketing experience [ <span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>]. Because this study did not include a placebo control group, causality could not be established.</p><p>Dizziness, headache, nausea, somnolence, and fatigue all occurred at lower incidences during the AED Withdrawal Phase and Monotherapy Phase, compared with the Titration Phase [ <span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14.1)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adjunctive Therapy Controlled Trials (Studies 2, 3, and 4)</span></p><p>In adjunctive therapy controlled clinical trials, the rate of discontinuation as a result of an adverse reaction was 8% and 17% in patients randomized to receive VIMPAT at the recommended doses of 200 and 400 mg/day, respectively, 29% at 600 mg/day (1.5 times greater than the maximum recommended dose), and 5% in patients randomized to receive placebo. The adverse reactions most commonly (&gt;1% on VIMPAT and greater than placebo) leading to discontinuation were dizziness, ataxia, vomiting, diplopia, nausea, vertigo, and blurred vision.</p><p>Table 3 gives the incidence of adverse reactions that occurred in ≥2% of adult patients with partial-onset seizures in the VIMPAT total group and for which the incidence was greater than placebo.</p><p>The overall adverse reaction rate was similar in male and female patients. Although there were few non-Caucasian patients, no differences in the incidences of adverse reactions compared to Caucasian patients were observed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients (4 to less than 17 Years of Age)</span></p><p>Safety of VIMPAT was evaluated in clinical studies of pediatric patients 4 to less than 17 years of age for the treatment of partial-onset seizures. Across studies in pediatric patients with partial-onset seizures, 328 patients 4 to less than 17 years of age received Vimpat Oral Solution or tablet, of whom 148 received VIMPAT for at least 1 year. Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies of pediatric patients 4 to less than 17 years of age were similar to those seen in adult patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Laboratory Abnormalities</span></p><p>Abnormalities in liver function tests have occurred in controlled trials with VIMPAT in adult patients with partial-onset seizures who were taking 1 to 3 concomitant anti-epileptic drugs. Elevations of ALT to ≥3× ULN occurred in 0.7% (7/935) of VIMPAT patients and 0% (0/356) of placebo patients <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">.</span></span> One case of hepatitis with transaminases &gt;20× ULN occurred in one healthy subject 10 days after VIMPAT treatment completion, along with nephritis (proteinuria and urine casts). Serologic studies were negative for viral hepatitis. Transaminases returned to normal within one month without specific treatment. At the time of this event, bilirubin was normal. The hepatitis/nephritis was interpreted as a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to VIMPAT.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Other Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>The following is a list of adverse reactions reported by patients treated with VIMPAT in all clinical trials in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, including controlled trials and long-term open-label extension trials. Adverse reactions addressed in other tables or sections are not listed here.</p><p>Blood and lymphatic system disorders: neutropenia, anemia</p><p>Cardiac disorders: palpitations</p><p>Ear and labyrinth disorders: tinnitus</p><p>Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, dyspepsia, dry mouth, oral hypoaesthesia</p><p>General disorders and administration site conditions: irritability, pyrexia, feeling drunk</p><p>Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications: fall</p><p>Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle spasms</p><p>Nervous system disorders: paresthesia, cognitive disorder, hypoaesthesia, dysarthria, disturbance in attention, cerebellar syndrome</p><p>Psychiatric disorders: confusional state, mood altered, depressed mood</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">VIMPAT Injection</span></p><p>Adverse reactions with intravenous administration to adult patients generally were similar to those that occurred with the oral formulation, although intravenous administration was associated with local adverse reactions such as injection site pain or discomfort (2.5%), irritation (1%), and erythema (0.5%). One case of profound bradycardia (26 bpm: BP 100/60 mmHg) occurred in a patient during a 15-minute infusion of 150 mg VIMPAT. This patient was on a beta-blocker. Infusion was discontinued and the patient experienced a rapid recovery.</p><p>The safety of a 15-minute loading dose administration of VIMPAT Injection 200 mg to 400 mg followed by oral administration of VIMPAT given twice daily at the same total daily dose as the initial intravenous infusion was assessed in an open-label study in adult patients with partial-onset seizures. Patients had to have been maintained on a stable dose regimen of 1 to 2 marketed antiepileptics for at least 28 days prior to treatment assignment. Treatment groups were as follows:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Single dose of intravenous VIMPAT Injection 200 mg followed by oral VIMPAT 200 mg/day (100 mg every 12 hours)</li>
<li>Single dose of intravenous VIMPAT Injection 300 mg followed by oral VIMPAT 300 mg/day (150 mg every 12 hours)</li>
<li>Single dose of intravenous VIMPAT Injection 400 mg followed by oral VIMPAT 400 mg/day (200 mg every 12 hours).</li>
</ul><p>Table 4 gives the incidence of adverse reactions that occurred in ≥5% of adult patients in any VIMPAT dosing group.</p><p>Adverse reactions that occurred with infusion of VIMPAT 200 mg over 15-minutes followed by VIMPAT 100 mg administered orally twice per day were similar in frequency to those that occurred in 3-month adjunctive therapy controlled trials. Considering the difference in period of observations (1 week vs. 3 months), the incidence of CNS adverse reactions, such as dizziness, somnolence, and paresthesia may be higher with 15-minute administration of VIMPAT Injection than with administration over a 30-to 60-minute period.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VIMPAT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Agranulocytosis</p><p>Psychiatric disorders: Aggression, agitation, hallucination, insomnia, psychotic disorder</p><p>Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Angioedema, rash, urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.</p><p>Neurologic disorders: New or worsening seizures</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Patients with renal or hepatic impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 may have a significant increase in exposure to VIMPAT. Dose reduction may be necessary in these patients.</p><h3>Concomitant Medications that Affect Cardiac Conduction</h3><p class="First">VIMPAT should be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction (sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers) including those that prolong PR interval (including sodium channel blocking AEDs), because of a risk of AV block, bradycardia, or ventricular tachyarrhythmia. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning VIMPAT, and after VIMPAT is titrated to steady-state, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered VIMPAT through the intravenous route [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>].</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Exposure Registry</span></p><p>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as VIMPAT, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking VIMPAT during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or visiting http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no adequate data on the developmental risks associated with the use of VIMPAT in pregnant women.</p><p>Lacosamide produced developmental toxicity (increased embryofetal and perinatal mortality, growth deficit) in rats following administration during pregnancy. Developmental neurotoxicity was observed in rats following administration during a period of postnatal development corresponding to the third trimester of human pregnancy. These effects were observed at doses associated with clinically relevant plasma exposures <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span> .</p><p>In the U.S. general population the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Oral administration of lacosamide to pregnant rats (20, 75, or 200 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg/kg/day) during the period of organogenesis did not produce any effects on the incidences of fetal structural abnormalities. However, the maximum doses evaluated were limited by maternal toxicity in both species and embryofetal death in rats. These doses were associated with maternal plasma lacosamide exposures (AUC) approximately 2 and 1 times (rat and rabbit, respectively) that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 400 mg/day.</p><p>In two studies in which lacosamide (25, 70, or 200 mg/kg/day and 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation, increased perinatal mortality and decreased body weights in the offspring were observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity in rats (70 mg/kg/day) was associated with a maternal plasma lacosamide AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD.</p><p>Oral administration of lacosamide (30, 90, or 180 mg/kg/day) to rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of development resulted in decreased brain weights and long-term neurobehavioral changes (altered open field performance, deficits in learning and memory). The early postnatal period in rats is generally thought to correspond to late pregnancy in humans in terms of brain development. The no-effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in rats was associated with a plasma lacosamide AUC less than that in humans at the MRHD.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">In Vitro Data</span></p><p>Lacosamide has been shown <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> to interfere with the activity of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a protein involved in neuronal differentiation and control of axonal outgrowth. Potential adverse effects on CNS development related to this activity cannot be ruled out.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of lacosamide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Studies in lactating rats have shown excretion of lacosamide and/or its metabolites in milk.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for VIMPAT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from VIMPAT or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of VIMPAT tablets and oral solution have been established in pediatric patients 4 to less than 17 years of age. Use of VIMPAT in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of VIMPAT in adults with partial-onset seizures, pharmacokinetic data from adult and pediatric patients, and safety data in 328 pediatric patients 4 to less than 17 years of age [ <span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p>Safety of VIMPAT injection in pediatric patients has not been established.</p><p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years have not been established.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Animal Data</span></span></p><p>Lacosamide has been shown <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> to interfere with the activity of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a protein involved in neuronal differentiation and control of axonal outgrowth. Potential related adverse effects on CNS development cannot be ruled out. Administration of lacosamide to rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of postnatal development (approximately equivalent to neonatal through adolescent development in humans) resulted in decreased brain weights and long-term neurobehavioral changes (altered open field performance, deficits in learning and memory). The no-effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in rats was associated with a plasma lacosamide exposure (AUC) less than that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose of 400 mg/day.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">There were insufficient numbers of elderly patients enrolled in partial-onset seizure trials (n=18) to adequately determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.</p><p>No VIMPAT dose adjustment based on age is necessary. In elderly patients, dose titration should be performed with caution, usually starting at the lower end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic function, decreased renal function, increased cardiac conduction abnormalities, and polypharmacy [ <span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3, 2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Based on data in adults, no dose adjustment is necessary in adult and pediatric patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (CL <span class="Sub">CR</span> ≥30 mL/min). In adult and pediatric patients with severe renal impairment (CL <span class="Sub">CR</span> &lt;30 mL/min) and in those with end-stage renal disease, a reduction of 25% of the maximum dosage is recommended [ <span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p>In all patients with renal impairment, dose titration should be performed with caution.</p><p>VIMPAT is effectively removed from plasma by hemodialysis. Dosage supplementation of up to 50% following hemodialysis should be considered.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Based on data in adults, for adult and pediatric patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, a reduction of 25% of the maximum dosage is recommended. Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should be observed closely during dose titration [ <span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment. VIMPAT use is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">VIMPAT is a Schedule V controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">In a human abuse potential study, single doses of 200 mg and 800 mg lacosamide produced euphoria-type subjective responses that differentiated statistically from placebo; at 800 mg, these euphoria-type responses were statistically indistinguishable from those produced by alprazolam, a Schedule IV drug. The duration of the euphoria-type responses following lacosamide was less than that following alprazolam. A high rate of euphoria was also reported as an adverse event in the human abuse potential study following single doses of 800 mg lacosamide (15% [5/34]) compared to placebo (0%) and in two pharmacokinetic studies following single and multiple doses of 300-800 mg lacosamide (ranging from 6% [2/33] to 25% [3/12]) compared to placebo (0%). However, the rate of euphoria reported as an adverse event in the VIMPAT development program at therapeutic doses was less than 1%.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Abrupt termination of lacosamide in clinical trials with diabetic neuropathic pain patients produced no signs or symptoms that are associated with a withdrawal syndrome indicative of physical dependence. However, psychological dependence cannot be excluded due to the ability of lacosamide to produce euphoria-type adverse events in humans.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Events reported after an intake of more than 800 mg (twice the maximum recommended daily dosage) of VIMPAT include dizziness, nausea, and seizures (generalized tonic-clonic seizures, status epilepticus). Cardiac conduction disorders, confusion, decreased level of consciousness, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, and coma have also been observed. Fatalities have occurred following lacosamide overdoses of several grams.</p><p>There is no specific antidote for overdose with VIMPAT. Standard decontamination procedures should be followed. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of patient. A Certified Poison Control Center should be contacted for up to date information on the management of overdose with VIMPAT.</p><p>Standard hemodialysis procedures result in significant clearance of VIMPAT (reduction of systemic exposure by 50% in 4 hours). Hemodialysis may be indicated based on the patient's clinical state or in patients with significant renal impairment.</p><h2>Vimpat Oral Solution Description</h2><p class="First">The chemical name of lacosamide, the single (R)-enantiomer, is (R)-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide (IUPAC). Lacosamide is a functionalized amino acid. Its molecular formula is C <span class="Sub">13</span>H <span class="Sub">18</span>N <span class="Sub">2</span>O <span class="Sub">3</span> and its molecular weight is 250.30. The chemical structure is:</p><p>Lacosamide is a white to light yellow powder. It is sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble in acetonitrile and ethanol.</p><h3>Vimpat Oral Solution</h3><p class="First">Vimpat Oral Solution contains 10 mg of lacosamide per mL. The inactive ingredients are purified water, sorbitol solution, glycerin, polyethylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, acesulfame potassium, methylparaben, flavoring (including natural and artificial flavors, propylene glycol, aspartame, and maltol), anhydrous citric acid and sodium chloride.</p><h2>Vimpat Oral Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The precise mechanism by which VIMPAT exerts its antiepileptic effects in humans remains to be fully elucidated. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes and inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (efficacy) analysis was performed based on the pooled data from the 3 efficacy trials for partial-onset seizures. Lacosamide exposure is correlated with the reduction in seizure frequency. However, doses above 400 mg/day do not appear to confer additional benefit in group analyses.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>Electrocardiographic effects of VIMPAT were determined in a double-blind, randomized clinical pharmacology trial of 247 healthy subjects. Chronic oral doses of 400 and 800 mg/day were compared with placebo and a positive control (400 mg moxifloxacin). VIMPAT did not prolong QTc interval and did not have a dose-related or clinically important effect on QRS duration. VIMPAT produced a small, dose-related increase in mean PR interval. At steady-state, the time of the maximum observed mean PR interval corresponded with t <span class="Sub">max</span>. The placebo-subtracted maximum increase in PR interval (at t <span class="Sub">max</span>) was 7.3 ms for the 400 mg/day group and 11.9 ms for the 800 mg/day group. For patients who participated in the controlled trials, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum increase in PR interval for a 400 mg/day VIMPAT dose was 3.1 ms in patients with partial-onset seizures and 9.4 ms for patients with diabetic neuropathy.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of VIMPAT have been studied in healthy adult subjects (age range 18 to 87), adults with partial-onset seizures, adults with diabetic neuropathy, and subjects with renal and hepatic impairment.</p><p>VIMPAT is completely absorbed after oral administration with negligible first-pass effect with a high absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. The maximum lacosamide plasma concentrations occur approximately 1 to 4 hour post-dose after oral dosing, and elimination half-life is approximately 13 hours. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 3 days of twice daily repeated administration. Pharmacokinetics of VIMPAT are dose proportional (100-800 mg) and time invariant, with low inter- and intra-subject variability. Compared to lacosamide the major metabolite, O-desmethyl metabolite, has a longer T <span class="Sub">max</span> (0.5 to 12 hours) and elimination half-life (15-23 hours).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption and Bioavailability</span></p><p>VIMPAT is completely absorbed after oral administration. The oral bioavailability of VIMPAT tablets is approximately 100%. Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption.</p><p>After intravenous administration, C <span class="Sub">max</span> is reached at the end of infusion. The 30- and 60-minute intravenous infusions are bioequivalent to the oral tablet. For the 15-minute intravenous infusion, bioequivalence was met for AUC <span class="Sub">(0-tz)</span> but not for C <span class="Sub">max</span>. The point estimate of C <span class="Sub">max</span> was 20% higher than C <span class="Sub">max</span> for oral tablet and the 90% CI for C <span class="Sub">max</span> exceeded the upper boundary of the bioequivalence range.</p><p>In a trial comparing the oral tablet with an oral solution containing 10 mg/mL lacosamide, bioequivalence between both formulations was shown.</p><p>A single loading dose of 200 mg approximates steady-state concentrations comparable to the 100 mg twice daily oral administration.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/kg and thus close to the volume of total body water. VIMPAT is less than 15% bound to plasma proteins.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Elimination</span></p><p>VIMPAT is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and biotransformation.</p><p>After oral and intravenous administration of 100 mg [14C]-lacosamide approximately 95% of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5% in the feces. The major compounds excreted were unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40% of the dose), its O-desmethyl metabolite (approximately 30%), and a structurally unknown polar fraction (~20%). The plasma exposure of the major human metabolite, O-desmethyl-lacosamide, is approximately 10% of that of lacosamide. This metabolite has no known pharmacological activity.</p><p>The CYP isoforms mainly responsible for the formation of the major metabolite (O-desmethyl) are CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. The elimination half-life of the unchanged drug is approximately 13 hours and is not altered by different doses, multiple dosing or intravenous administration.</p><p>There is no enantiomeric interconversion of lacosamide.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Lacosamide and its major metabolite are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion.</p><p>The AUC of VIMPAT was increased approximately 25% in mildly (CL <span class="Sub">CR</span> 50-80 mL/min) and moderately (CL <span class="Sub">CR</span> 30-50 mL/min) and 60% in severely (CL <span class="Sub">CR</span>≤30 mL/min) renally impaired patients compared to subjects with normal renal function (CL <span class="Sub">CR</span>&gt;80 mL/min), whereas C <span class="Sub">max</span> was unaffected. VIMPAT is effectively removed from plasma by hemodialysis.

Both apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution increase as body weight increases. For patients weighing 11 kg, 28.9 kg (the mean population body weight), and 70 kg, the typical plasma half-life (t <span class="Sub">1/2</span>) is 7.4 hours, 10.6 hours, and 14.8 hours, respectively. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 3 days of twice daily repeated administration.

To be included in Study 1, patients were required to be taking stable doses of 1 or 2 marketed antiepileptic drugs. This treatment continued into the 8 week baseline period. To remain in the study, patients were required to have at least 2 partial-onset seizures per 28 days during the 8 week baseline period. The baseline period was followed by a 3 week titration period, during which VIMPAT was added to the ongoing antiepileptic regimen. This was followed by a 16-week maintenance period (i.e., a 6-week withdrawal period for background antiepileptic drugs, followed by a 10-week monotherapy period). Patients were randomized 3 to 1 to receive VIMPAT 400 mg/day or VIMPAT 300 mg/day. Treatment assignments were blinded. Response to treatment was based upon a comparison of the number of patients who met exit criteria during the maintenance phase, compared to historical controls. The historical control consisted of a pooled analysis of the control groups from 8 studies of similar design, which utilized a sub-therapeutic dose of an antiepileptic drug. Statistical superiority to the historical control was considered to be demonstrated if the upper limit from a 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the percentage of patients meeting exit criteria in patients receiving VIMPAT remained below the lower 95% prediction limit of 65% derived from the historical control data.</p><p>The exit criteria were one or more of the following: (1) doubling of average monthly seizure frequency during any 28 consecutive days, (2) doubling of highest consecutive 2-day seizure frequency, (3) occurrence of a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure, (4) clinically significant prolongation or worsening of overall seizure duration, frequency, type or pattern considered by the investigator to require trial discontinuation, (5) status epilepticus or new onset of serial/cluster seizures. The study population profile appeared comparable to that of the historical control population.</p><p>For the VIMPAT 400 mg/day group, the estimate of the percentage of patients meeting at least 1 exit criterion was 30% (95% CI: 25%, 36%). The upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI (36%) was below the threshold of 65% derived from the historical control data, meeting the pre-specified criteria for efficacy. VIMPAT 300 mg/day also met the pre-specified criteria for efficacy.</p><h3>Adjunctive Therapy in Patients with Partial-Onset Seizures</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of VIMPAT as adjunctive therapy in partial-onset seizures was established in three 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials in adult patients (Study 2, Study 3, and Study 4). Enrolled patients had partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization, and were not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs. During an 8-week baseline period, patients were required to have an average of ≥4 partial-onset seizures per 28 days with no seizure-free period exceeding 21 days. In these 3 trials, patients had a mean duration of epilepsy of 24 years and a median baseline seizure frequency ranging from 10 to 17 per 28 days. 84% of patients were taking 2 to 3 concomitant AEDs with or without concurrent vagal nerve stimulation.</p><p>Study 2 compared doses of VIMPAT 200, 400, and 600 mg/day with placebo. Study 3 compared doses of VIMPAT 400 and 600 mg/day with placebo. Study 4 compared doses of VIMPAT 200 and 400 mg/day with placebo. In all three trials, following an 8-week baseline phase to establish baseline seizure frequency prior to randomization, patients were randomized and titrated to the randomized dose (a 1-step back-titration of VIMPAT 100 mg/day or placebo was allowed in the case of intolerable adverse events at the end of the titration phase). During the titration phase, in all 3 adjunctive therapy trials, treatment was initiated at 100 mg/day (50 mg twice daily), and increased in weekly increments of 100 mg/day to the target dose. The titration phase lasted 6 weeks in Study 2 and Study 3, and 4 weeks in Study 4. In all three trials, the titration phase was followed by a maintenance phase that lasted 12 weeks, during which patients were to remain on a stable dose of VIMPAT.</p><p>A reduction in 28 day seizure frequency (baseline to maintenance phase), as compared to the placebo group, was the primary variable in all three adjunctive therapy trials. A statistically significant effect was observed with VIMPAT treatment (Figure 1) at doses of 200 mg/day (Study 4), 400 mg/day (Studies 2, 3, and 4), and 600 mg/day (Studies 2 and 3).</p><p>Subset evaluations of VIMPAT demonstrate no important differences in seizure control as a function of gender or race, although data on race was limited (about 10% of patients were non-Caucasian).</p><p>Figure 2 presents the percentage of patients (X-axis) with a percent reduction in partial seizure frequency (responder rate) from baseline to the maintenance phase at least as great as that represented on the Y-axis. A positive value on the Y-axis indicates an improvement from baseline (i.e., a decrease in seizure frequency), while a negative value indicates a worsening from baseline (i.e., an increase in seizure frequency). Thus, in a display of this type, a curve for an effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for placebo. The proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction in seizure frequency was consistently higher for the VIMPAT groups, compared to the placebo group. For example, 40% of patients randomized to VIMPAT (400 mg/day) experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, compared to 23% of patients randomized to placebo. Patients with an increase in seizure frequency &gt;100% are represented on the Y-axis as equal to or greater than -100%.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">VIMPAT (lacosamide) Oral Solution</span></p><ul class="Disc">
