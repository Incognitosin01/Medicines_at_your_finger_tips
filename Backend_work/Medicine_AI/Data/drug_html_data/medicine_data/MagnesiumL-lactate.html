Actions on lipoprotein lipase have been found to be important in reducing serum cholesterol and on sodium/potassium ATPase in promoting polarization (eg, neuromuscular functioning).</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Oral: Inversely proportional to amount ingested; 40% to 60% under controlled dietary conditions; 15% to 36% at higher doses; majority occurs in jejunum and ileum.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Bone (50% to 60%); extracellular fluid (1% to 2%)</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (as magnesium)</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>30%, to albumin</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p>Dietary supplement</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Dietary supplement:</b> Oral:1 to 2 caplets every 12 hours</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Oral: Should be administered with food.</p><p>Bariatric surgery: Tablet, extended release: Some institutions may have specific protocols that conflict with these recommendations; refer to institutional protocols as appropriate.

Management: Consider using a non-magnesium-containing antacid or phosphate-binding product in patients also receiving alfacalcidol.  If magnesium-containing products must be used with alfacalcidol, serum magnesium concentrations should be monitored closely.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Alpha-Lipoic Acid: Magnesium Salts may decrease the absorption of Alpha-Lipoic Acid. Alpha-Lipoic Acid may decrease the absorption of Magnesium Salts.  Management: Separate administration of alpha-lipoic acid from that of any magnesium-containing compounds by several hours. If alpha-lipoic acid is given 30 minutes before breakfast, then administer oral magnesium-containing products at lunch or dinner.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Baloxavir Marboxil: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of Baloxavir Marboxil. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Bictegravir: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of Bictegravir.

Coadministration of bictegravir with or 2 hours after most polyvalent cation products is not recommended.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Bisphosphonate Derivatives: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of Bisphosphonate Derivatives.  Management: Avoid administration of oral medications containing polyvalent cations within: 2 hours before or after tiludronate/clodronate/etidronate; 60 minutes after oral ibandronate; or 30 minutes after alendronate/risedronate.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Calcitriol (Systemic): May increase the serum concentration of Magnesium Salts. Management: Consider using a non-magnesium-containing antacid or phosphate-binding product in patients also receiving calcitriol. If magnesium-containing products must be used with calcitriol, serum magnesium concentrations should be monitored closely.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Calcium Channel Blockers: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Magnesium Salts. Magnesium Salts may enhance the hypotensive effect of Calcium Channel Blockers.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Deferiprone: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of Deferiprone.  Management: Separate administration of deferiprone and oral medications or supplements that contain polyvalent cations by at least 4 hours.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Dolutegravir: Magnesium Salts may decrease the serum concentration of Dolutegravir.  Management: Administer dolutegravir at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after oral magnesium salts. Administer the dolutegravir/rilpivirine combination product at least 4 hours before or 6 hours after oral magnesium salts.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Doxercalciferol: May enhance the hypermagnesemic effect of Magnesium Salts. Management: Consider using a non-magnesium-containing antacid or phosphate-binding product in patients also receiving doxercalciferol. If magnesium-containing products must be used with doxercalciferol, serum magnesium concentrations should be monitored closely.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Eltrombopag: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of Eltrombopag.  Management: Administer eltrombopag at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after oral administration of any polyvalent cation containing product.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Elvitegravir: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of Elvitegravir.

No dose separation schedule has been established that adequately reduces the magnitude of interaction.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Tetracyclines: Magnesium Salts may decrease the absorption of Tetracyclines. Only applicable to oral preparations of each agent.  Management: Avoid coadministration of oral magnesium salts and oral tetracyclines. If coadministration cannot be avoided, administer oral magnesium at least 2 hours before, or 4 hours after, oral tetracyclines. Monitor for decreased tetracycline therapeutic effects.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Trientine: Polyvalent Cation Containing Products may decrease the serum concentration of Trientine.
