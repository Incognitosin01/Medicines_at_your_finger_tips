Each mL contains 300 mg oxytetracycline as base, 40% (v/v) glycerol formal, 10% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 200, 2.7% (w/v) magnesium oxide, 0.4% (w/v) sodium formaldehyde sulphoxylate (as a preservative) and monoethanolamine (as required to adjust pH).</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Tetradure<span class="Sup">™</span> 300 is intended for use in treatment for the following disease when due to oxytetracycline-susceptible organisms:</p><h3>Beef cattle, non-lactating dairy cattle, calves, including pre-ruminating (veal) calves</h3><p class="First">Tetradure<span class="Sup">™</span> 300 is indicated in the treatment of pneumonia and shipping fever complex associated with <span class="Italics">Pasteurella</span> spp., and <span class="Italics">Histophilus</span> spp. Tetradure<span class="Sup">™</span> 300 is indicated for the treatment of the infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (pink eye) caused by <span class="Italics">Moraxella bovis</span>, foot-rot and diphtheria caused by <span class="Italics">Fusobacterium necrophorum</span>; bacterial enteritis (scours) caused by <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>; wooden tongue caused by <span class="Italics">Actinobacillus lignieresi</span>; leptospirosis caused by <span class="Italics">Leptospira pomona</span>; and wound infections and acute metritis caused by strains of staphylococcal and streptococcal organisms sensitive to oxytetracycline. Also, it is indicated for the control of respiratory disease in cattle at high risk of developing BRD associated with <span class="Italics">Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica</span>.</p><h3>Swine</h3><p class="First">Tetradure<span class="Sup">™</span> 300 is indicated in the treatment of bacterial enteritis (scours, colibacillosis) caused by <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>; pneumonia caused by <span class="Italics">Pasteurella multocida</span>; and leptospirosis caused by <span class="Italics">Leptospira pomona</span>.</p><p>In sows Tetradure<span class="Sup">™</span> 300 is indicated as an aid in control of infectious enteritis (baby pig scours, colibacillosis) in suckling pigs caused by <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>.</p><h2>PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">Oxytetracycline is derived from the metabolic activity of the actinomycete, <span class="Italics">Streptomyces rimosus</span>. Oxytetracycline is an antimicrobial agent that is effective in the treatment of a wide range of diseases caused by susceptible gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.</p><p>The antibiotic activity of oxytetracycline is not appreciably diminished in the presence of body fluids, serum or exudates.</p><p>Studies have shown that the half-life of oxytetracycline in blood following intramuscular treatment with Tetradure<span class="Sup">™</span> 300 at 5 mg per pound of bodyweight is approximately 23 hours in cattle and 18 hours in swine.</p><p>Studies have shown when Tetradure<span class="Sup">™</span> 300 is administered once intramuscularly to cattle or swine at 9 mg per pound of bodyweight, blood oxytetracycline concentration of greater than 0.2 mcg/mL have been observed for 3 to 4 days.</p><p>Studies have shown when Tetradure<span class="Sup">™</span> 300 is administered once intramuscularly or subcutaneously to cattle at 13.6 mg per pound of bodyweight, blood oxytetracycline concentration of greater than 0.2 mcg/mL have been observed for at least 7 to 8 days.</p><h2>Tetradure Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Beef cattle, non-lactating dairy cattle, calves, including pre-ruminating (veal) calves</h3><p class="First">A single intramuscular or subcutaneous dosage of 13.6 mg of oxytetracycline per pound of bodyweight, Tetradure<span class="Sup">™</span> 300 is recommended for the control of respiratory disease in cattle at high risk of developing BRD associated with <span class="Italics">Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica</span>.</p><p>At a single intramuscular or subcutaneous dose range of 9 to 13.6 mg of oxytetracycline per pound of bodyweight, Tetradure<span class="Sup">™</span> 300 is recommended in the treatment of the following conditions:</p><p>For other indications Tetradure<span class="Sup">™</span> 300 is to be administered intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intravenously at a level of 3 to 5 mg of oxytetracycline per pound of bodyweight per day. In treatment of foot-rot and advanced cases of other indicated diseases, a dosage level of 5 mg per pound of bodyweight per day is recommended. Treatment should be continued 24 to 48 hours following remission of disease signs, however, not to exceed a total of four (4) consecutive days. If improvement is not noted within 24 to 48 hours of the beginning of treatment, diagnosis and therapy should be re-evaluated.</p><p>Do not administer intramuscularly in the neck of small calves due to lack of sufficient muscle mass.</p><p>Use extreme care when administering this product by intravenous injection. Perivascular injection or leakage from an intravenous injection may cause severe swelling at the injection site.</p><h3>Swine</h3><p class="First">A single dosage of 9 mg of oxytetracycline per pound of bodyweight administered intramuscularly is recommended in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia caused by <span class="Italics">Pasteurella multocida</span> in swine, where retreatment is impractical due to husbandry conditions or where repeated restraint is inadvisable.</p><p>Tetradure<span class="Sup">™</span> 300 can also be administered by intramuscular injection at a level of 3 to 5 mg of oxytetracycline per pound of bodyweight per day. Treatment should be continued 24 to 48 hours following remission of disease signs; however, not to exceed a total of four (4) consecutive days. If improvement is not noted within 24 to 48 hours of the beginning of treatment, diagnosis and therapy should be re-evaluated.</p><p>For sows, administer once intramuscularly 3 mg of oxytetracycline per pound of bodyweight approximately eight (8) hours before farrowing or immediately after completion of farrowing as an aid in the control of infectious enteritis in baby pigs.</p><p>For swine weighing 25 lbs of bodyweight and under, Tetradure<span class="Sup">™</span> 300 should be administered undiluted for treatment at 9 mg/lb but should be administered diluted for treatment at 3 or 5 mg/lb.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Exceeding the highest recommended level of drug per pound of bodyweight per day, administering more than the recommended number of treatments, and/or exceeding 10 mL intramuscularly or subcutaneously per injection site in adult beef cattle and non-lactating dairy cattle and 5 mL intramuscularly per injection site in adult swine, may result in antibiotic residues beyond the withdrawal time.</p><p>Consult with your veterinarian prior to administering this product in order to determine to proper treatment required in the event of an adverse reaction. At the first sign of any adverse reaction, discontinue use of the product and seek the advice of your veterinarian. Some of the reactions may be attributable either to anaphylaxis (an allergic reaction) or to cardiovascular collapse of unknown cause.</p><p>Shortly after injection treated animals may have transient hemoglobinuria resulting in darkened urine.</p><p>As with all antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. The absence of a favourable response following treatment, or the development of new signs or symptoms may suggest an overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms. If superinfections occur, the use of this product should be discontinued and appropriate specific therapy should be instituted.</p><p>Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving Tetradure<span class="Sup">™</span> 300 in conjunction with penicillin.</p><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Store at room temperature, 59°-86°F (15°-30°C). Keep from freezing.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span> Discontinue treatment at least 28 days prior to slaughter of cattle and swine. Not for use in lactating dairy animals. Rapid intravenous administration may result in animal collapse. Oxytetracycline should be administered intravenous slowly over a period of at least 5 minutes.</p><p class="First">The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) contains more detailed occupational safety information.
