Pull the ear lobe backward and upward and apply drops into the ear. Keep head tilted for about a minute to allow the drops to penetrate lower into the ear canal. Gently pat excess material dripping out of the ear using a clean cotton ball.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store a controlled room temperature of 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>There are no known significant interactions.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Frequency not defined.</p><p>Dermatologic: Acneiform eruptions, allergic contact dermatitis, burning, dryness, erythema, folliculitis, irritation, itching,  hypopigmentation, keratosis pilaris, miliaria, skin atrophy, striae</p><p>Otic: Ear infection</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Adrenal suppression: May cause hypercortisolism or suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, particularly in younger children or in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods. HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis. Withdrawal and discontinuation of a corticosteroid should be done slowly and carefully. Particular care is required when patients are transferred from systemic corticosteroids to inhaled products due to possible adrenal insufficiency or withdrawal from steroids, including an increase in allergic symptoms. Adult patients receiving &gt;20 mg per day of prednisone (or equivalent) may be most susceptible. Fatalities have occurred due to adrenal insufficiency in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to aerosol steroids; aerosol steroids do <b>not</b> provide the systemic steroid needed to treat patients having trauma, surgery, or infections.</p><p>• Contact dermatitis: Allergic contact dermatitis can occur, it is usually diagnosed by failure to heal rather than clinical exacerbation.</p><p>• Infection: Steroids may mask infection; prolonged use may result in secondary infections due to immunosuppression.</p><p>• Systemic effects: Adverse systemic effects may occur when used on large areas of the body, denuded areas, or for prolonged periods of time. Infants and children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to larger skin surface to body mass ratio.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Peanut oil: DermOtic Oil contains peanut oil; use caution in peanut-sensitive individuals.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Signs of bacterial or fungal infection</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Adverse events have been observed with corticosteroids in animal reproduction studies. In general, the use of topical corticosteroids during pregnancy is not considered to have significant risk; however, intrauterine growth retardation in the infant has been reported (rare). The use of large amounts or for prolonged periods of time should be avoided.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat ear infections.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
