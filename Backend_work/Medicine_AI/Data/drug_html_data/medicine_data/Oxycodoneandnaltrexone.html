Assess risk before prescribing and regularly monitor for signs of these behaviors and conditions. Serious and potentially fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating or increasing dosage. Instruct patients to swallow capsules whole. Do not crush, chew, or dissolve capsules. Accidental ingestion of one dose or more can lead to fatal overdose, especially in children. Prolonged use during pregnancy can lead to potentially life-threatening neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. Initiation of CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of oxycodone HCl/naltrexone HCl and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required and monitor patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

It belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). Oxycodone acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.</p><p>Oxycodone and naltrexone combination should not be used if you need pain medicine for just a short time, such as when recovering from surgery. Do not use oxycodone and naltrexone to relieve mild pain, or in situations when non-narcotic medication is effective. Oxycodone and naltrexone should not be used to treat pain that you only have once in a while or "as needed".</p><p>When oxycodone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.</p><p>Oxycodone and naltrexone is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using oxycodone and naltrexone</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For oxycodone and naltrexone, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to oxycodone and naltrexone or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Troxyca® ER in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Troxyca® ER in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related lung, liver, or kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving Troxyca® ER in order to avoid potentially serious side effects.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women breastfeeding have demonstrated harmful infant effects. An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using oxycodone and naltrexone.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking oxycodone and naltrexone, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using oxycodone and naltrexone with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>

Make sure you store the medicine in a safe and secure place to prevent others from getting it.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using oxycodone and naltrexone</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress while you are taking oxycodone and naltrexone</i>. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it.</p><p>Oxycodone and naltrexone may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using oxycodone and naltrexone.</p><p>Do not use more of oxycodone and naltrexone or take it more often than your doctor tells you to. This can be life-threatening. <i>Symptoms of an overdose include extreme dizziness or weakness, slow heartbeat or breathing, seizures, trouble breathing, and cold, clammy skin. Call your doctor right away if you notice these symptoms</i>.</p><p>Oxycodone and naltrexone will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that can make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. <i>Check with your doctor before taking any of these medicines while you are using oxycodone and naltrexone</i>.</p><p>Oxycodone and naltrexone may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose. Call your doctor for instructions.</p><p>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. Also, lying down for a while may relieve the dizziness or lightheadedness.</p><p>Oxycodone and naltrexone may make you dizzy, drowsy, or lightheaded. <i>Make sure you know how you react to oxycodone and naltrexone before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or not alert</i>.</p><p>Using narcotics for a long time can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may direct you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.</p><p><i>If you have been using oxycodone and naltrexone regularly for several weeks or longer, do not change your dose or suddenly stop using it without checking with your doctor</i>. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, such as chills, runny nose, muscle pain, sweating, restlessness, or yawning.</p><p>Using oxycodone and naltrexone while you are pregnant may cause serious unwanted effects in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using oxycodone and naltrexone.</p><p>Talk with your doctor before using oxycodone and naltrexone if you plan to have children. Some men and women who use oxycodone and naltrexone have become infertile (unable to have children).</p><p>Make sure your doctor knows about all the other medicines you are using.
