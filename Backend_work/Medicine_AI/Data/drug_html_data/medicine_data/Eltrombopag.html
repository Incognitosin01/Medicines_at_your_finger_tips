ITP is a bleeding condition caused by a lack of platelets in the blood.</p><p>Eltrombopag is not a cure for ITP and it will not make your platelet counts normal if you have this condition.</p><p>Eltrombopag is also used to prevent bleeding in adults with chronic hepatitis C who are treated with an interferon (such as Intron A, Infergen, Pegasys, PegIntron, Rebetron, Redipen, or Sylatron).</p><p>Eltrombopag is also used together with other medications to treat severe aplastic anemia in adults and children who are at least 2 years old.</p><p>Eltrombopag is sometimes given after other treatments have failed.</p><p>Eltrombopag is not for use in treating myelodysplastic syndrome (also called "preleukemia").</p><p>Eltrombopag may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Call your doctor at once if you have signs of liver problems</b>: nausea, upper stomach pain, confusion, tired feeling, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-colored stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Your eyes may also need to be checked for signs of cataracts.</p><p>Eltrombopag doses are based on weight in children younger than 6 years old. Your child's dose needs may change if the child gains or loses weight.</p><p>Eltrombopag is usually taken for 6 months. It may take up to 4 weeks before the medicine prevents major bleeding episodes.
