This medicine is given after other treatments did not work or have stopped working.</p><p>Tecartus is made from your own white blood cells, removed from a small amount of blood drawn from your body.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>A common but serious side effect of Tecartus is called cytokine release syndrome, which causes fever, chills, trouble breathing, vomiting, and other symptoms. Your caregivers will have medication available to quickly treat this condition if it occurs.</p><p>It is important to tell your healthcare provider that you received Tecartus and to show them your Tecartus Patient Wallet Card. Your healthcare provider may give you other medicines to treat your side effects.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with Tecartus while you have an active infection (such as fever, chills, flu-like symptoms).</p><p>To make sure Tecartus is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had::</p><ul>

Talk with your doctor if you plan to become pregnant after you are treated with this medicine.</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using Tecartus. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="directions">How is Tecartus given?</h2><p>Tecartus is available only at an authorized hospital or clinic, and must be given by specially trained healthcare professionals.</p><p>Your care providers will use an intravenous (IV) needle to draw your blood for collecting the white blood cells. The cells are then frozen and sent to a laboratory where they are made into brexucabtagene autoleucel. Because it will take time to process your blood cells into brexucabtagene autoleucel, you will not receive the medicine on the same day your blood cells are drawn.</p><p>Beginning 5 days before this medicine is given, you will be pre-treated with chemotherapy to help prepare your body for Tecartus.</p><p>About 30 to 60 minutes before you receive Tecartus, you will be given other medications to help prevent serious side effects or allergic reaction.</p><p>Once your body is ready to receive Tecartus, your care providers will inject the medicine as an infusion into a vein.</p><p>Your doctor will need to check your progress on a daily basis for at least 7 days after the infusion.</p><p>For at least 4 weeks, plan to stay near the hospital or clinic where you received Tecartus.</p><p>Tecartus affects your immune system. You may get infections more easily, even serious or fatal infections.</p><p>If you've ever had hepatitis B, using Tecartus can cause this virus to become active or get worse. You may need frequent liver function tests.</p><p>Tecartus can have long lasting effects on your body. You may need frequent medical tests while using this medicine and for a short time after your last dose.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p><b>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss an appointment for your pre-treatment chemotherapy.</b> The timing of your chemotherapy and Tecartus injection is very important to the success of your treatment for mantle cell lymphoma.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since this medicine is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving Tecartus?</h2><p>This medicine can cause weakness, drowsiness, confusion, problems with memory or coordination, and seizures. <b>Avoid driving or operating machinery for at least 8 weeks after you are treated with Tecartus.</b></p><p>Do not receive a "live" vaccine while using Tecartus.
