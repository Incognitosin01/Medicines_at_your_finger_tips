Tropicamide is a parasympatholytic agent which produces mydriasis and paralysis by blocking the sphincter muscle in the iris and the ciliary muscle.</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>15 minutes</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>60 minutes</p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>3 hours; complete recovery usually occurs in 6-8 hours, but may take up to 24 hours</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Mydriasis:</b> Short-term pupil dilation for diagnostic procedures</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to hydroxyamphetamine, tropicamide, or any component of the formulation; angle-closure glaucoma or those with narrow angles where dilation of the pupil may precipitate angle-closure glaucoma</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Mydriasis: </b>Ophthalmic: Instill 1 to 2 drops into conjunctival sac(s)</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>For topical ophthalmic use only. To avoid excessive systemic absorption, apply gentle finger pressure to lacrimal sac for 2 to 3 minutes following application. Do not touch dropper tip to eyelids or other surfaces when placing drops in eyes.

Psychotic reactions, behavioral disturbances, and vasomotor or cardiorespiratory collapse in children have been reported with the use of anticholinergic drugs.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For topical ophthalmic use only. To avoid excessive systemic absorption, apply gentle finger pressure to lacrimal sac for 2 to 3 minutes following application. Do not touch dropper tip to eyelids or any surface.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Ophthalmic exam, intraocular pressure, CNS reactions (especially in pediatric patients).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this combination. If ophthalmic agents are needed during pregnancy, the minimum effective dose should be used in combination with punctal occlusion to decrease potential exposure to the fetus (Samples, 1988).</p><h2>More about hydroxyamphetamine / tropicamide ophthalmic</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
