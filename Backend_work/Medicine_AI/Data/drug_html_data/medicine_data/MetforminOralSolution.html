<li>Severe renal impairment (eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</li>
<li>Hypersensitivity to metformin.</li>
<li>Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Lactic Acidosis</h3><p class="First">There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (&gt; 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally &gt; 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.</p><p>If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride oral solution. In metformin hydrochloride oral solution-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.</p><p>Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride oral solution and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.</p><p>For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:</p><ul>
<li><span class="Italics">Renal impairment</span>—The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.</li>
</ul><p>The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient’s renal function include [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]:</p><ul>
<li>Before initiating metformin hydrochloride oral solution, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).</li>
<li>Metformin hydrochloride oral solution is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span>].</li>
<li>Initiation of metformin hydrochloride oral solution is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>.</li>
<li>Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride oral solution. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.</li>
<li>In patients taking metformin hydrochloride oral solution whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Drug interactions</span> — The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride oral solution with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Age 65 or greater</span> — The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient’s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Radiologic studies with contrast —</span> Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride oral solution at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra- arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride oral solution if renal function is stable.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Surgery and other procedures —</span> Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride oral solution should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Hypoxic states —</span> Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride oral solution.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Excessive alcohol intake —</span> Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride oral solution.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Hepatic impairment —</span> Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride oral solution in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.</li>
</ul><h3>Vitamin B12 Deficiency</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin hydrochloride (HCl) tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B<span class="Sub">12</span> absorption from the B<span class="Sub">12</span>-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> at 2 to 3-year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride oral solution and manage any abnormalities [see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>].</p><h3>Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues</h3><p class="First">Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride oral solution may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride oral solution <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Macrovascular Outcomes</h3><p class="First">There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride oral solution.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><ul>
<li>The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</li>
<li>Lactic Acidosis <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> Deficiency <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span><span class="Italics">]</span></li>
<li>Hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>In a U.S. clinical trial of metformin HCl tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a total of 141 patients received metformin HCl tablets up to 2,550 mg per day. Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of patients treated with metformin HCl tablets and that were more common than in placebo-treated patients, are listed in Table 1.</p><p>Diarrhea led to discontinuation of metformin HCl tablets in 6% of patients. Additionally, the following adverse reactions were reported in ≥ 1% to ≤ 5% of patients treated with metformin HCl tablets and were more commonly reported than placebo: abnormal stools, hypoglycemia, myalgia, lightheaded, dyspnea, nail disorder, rash, sweating increased, taste disorder, chest discomfort, chills, flu syndrome, flushing, palpitation.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>In clinical trials with metformin HCl tablets in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the profile of adverse reactions was similar to that observed in adults.</p><p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> Concentrations</span></p><p>In clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of metformin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Table 2 presents clinically significant drug interactions with metformin hydrochloride oral solution.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Metformin Hydrochloride Oral Solution</span></p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Limited data with metformin hydrochloride oral solution in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Considerations]</span>.</p><p>No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 2- and 5-times, respectively, a 2,550 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>.<br/>
The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus with an HbA1C &gt;7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a HbA1C &gt;10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk</span></p><p>Poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, stillbirth and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Published data from post-marketing studies have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin- associated risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Metformin hydrochloride did not adversely affect development outcomes when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of about 2 and 5 times a 2,550 mg clinical dose based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of metformin on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for metformin hydrochloride oral solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from metformin hydrochloride oral solution or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin hydrochloride oral solution may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride oral solution for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old. Safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride oral solution have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years old.</p><p>Use of metformin hydrochloride oral solution in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of metformin HCl tablets in adults with additional data from a controlled clinical study of metformin HCl tablets in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which demonstrated a similar response in glycemic control to that seen in adults <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. In this study, adverse reactions were similar to those described in adults. A maximum daily dose of 2,000 mg of metformin hydrochloride oral solution is recommended. [See <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.2).</span>]</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Controlled clinical studies of metformin HCl tablets did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride oral solution is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2 </span>[see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. Metformin hydrochloride oral solution is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdose of metformin hydrochloride has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]. Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected.</p><h2>Metformin Oral Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Metformin hydrochloride oral solution contains the biguanidine antihyperglycemic agent metformin in the form of monohydrochloride salt. Metformin hydrochloride, USP is <span class="Italics">N</span>,<span class="Italics">N</span>-dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide hydrochloride. The structural formula is shown as:</p><p></p><p>Metformin hydrochloride, USP is a white crystalline powder with a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">4</span>H<span class="Sub">11</span>N<span class="Sub">5</span>•HCl and a molecular weight of 165.62. The pKa of metformin is 12.4. The pH of a 1% aqueous solution of metformin hydrochloride is 6.68. It is freely soluble in water; slightly soluble in alcohol; practically insoluble in acetone and in methylene chloride.</p><p>Metformin hydrochloride oral solution contains 500 mg of metformin hydrochloride, USP (the equivalent of 389.93 mg metformin) per 5 mL and the following inactive ingredients: Benzoic Acid, hydrochloric acid, potassium bicarbonate, purified water, strawberry flavor, sucralose, and xanthan gum.</p><h2>Metformin Oral Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></span></p><p>Two pharmacokinetic studies performed in healthy volunteers to evaluate the bioavailability of metformin hydrochloride oral solution in comparison with metformin HCl tablets under fasting and fed conditions showed that the rate and extent of absorption of metformin hydrochloride oral solution was found to be comparable to that of metformin HCl tablets under fasting or fed conditions (see Table 3).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Table 3: Select Mean (± S.D.)
