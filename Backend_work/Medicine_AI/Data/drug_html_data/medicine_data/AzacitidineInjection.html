</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Azacitidine Injection</h2><h3>Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)</h3><p class="First">Azacitidine for Injection is indicated for treatment of patients with the following French-American-British (FAB) myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes: refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL).</p><h2>Azacitidine Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>First Treatment Cycle</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline hematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> subcutaneously or intravenously, daily for 7 days. Premedicate patients for nausea and vomiting.</p><p>Obtain complete blood counts, liver chemistries and serum creatinine prior to the first dose.</p><h3>Subsequent Treatment Cycles</h3><p class="First">Repeat cycles every 4 weeks. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> if no beneficial effect is seen after 2 treatment cycles and if no toxicity other than nausea and vomiting has occurred. It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 4 to 6 cycles. However, complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit.</p><p>Monitor patients for hematologic response and renal toxicities <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)],</span> and delay or reduce dosage if necessary as described below.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustment Based on Hematology Laboratory Values</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>For patients with baseline (start of treatment) WBC greater than or equal to 3.0 x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L, ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L, and platelets greater than or equal to 75.0 x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L, adjust the dose as follows, based on nadir counts for any given cycle:</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>For patients whose baseline counts are WBC less than 3.0 x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L, ANC less than 1.5 x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L, or platelets less than 75.0 x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L, base dose adjustments on nadir counts and bone marrow biopsy cellularity at the time of the nadir as noted below, unless there is clear improvement in differentiation (percentage of mature granulocytes is higher and ANC is higher than at onset of that course) at the time of the next cycle, in which case continue the current dose.</li>
</ul><p class="First">If a nadir as defined in the table above has occurred, give the next course 28 days after the start of the preceding course, provided that both the WBC and the platelet counts are greater than 25% above the nadir and rising. If a greater than 25% increase above the nadir is not seen by day 28, reassess counts every 7 days. If a 25% increase is not seen by day 42, reduce the scheduled dose by 50%.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustment Based on Serum Electrolytes and Renal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mEq/L occur, reduce the dosage by 50% for the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, delay the next cycle until values return to normal or baseline and reduce the dose by 50% for the next course <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><h3>Use in Geriatric Patients</h3><p class="First">Azacitidine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, select the dose carefully and monitor renal function <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5</span>)<span class="Italics">].</span></p><h3>Preparation of Azacitidine for Injection</h3><p class="First">Azacitidine for injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures.<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p>The azacitidine for injection vial is single-dose and does not contain any preservatives. Discard unused portions of each vial properly <span class="Italics">[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].</span> Do not save any unused portions for later administration.</p><h3>Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration</h3><p class="First">Reconstitute azacitidine for injection aseptically with 4 mL sterile water for injection. Inject the diluent slowly into the vial. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until a uniform suspension is achieved. The suspension will be cloudy. The resulting suspension will contain azacitidine 25 mg per mL. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution. Doing so could remove the active substance.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Preparation for Immediate Subcutaneous Administration</span></p><p>For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product may be held at room temperature for up to 1 hour, but must be administered within 1 hour after reconstitution.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Preparation for Delayed Subcutaneous Administration</span></p><p>The reconstituted product may be kept in the vial or drawn into a syringe. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, divide the dose equally between the syringes (e.g., dose 150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe) and inject into two separate sites. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. The product must be refrigerated immediately. When azacitidine for injection is reconstituted using water for injection that has not been refrigerated, the reconstituted product may be held under refrigerated conditions (2º to 8ºC, 36º to 46ºF) for up to 8 hours. When azacitidine for injection is reconstituted using refrigerated (2º to 8ºC, 36º to 46ºF) water for injection, the reconstituted product may be stored under refrigerated conditions (2º to 8ºC, 36º to 46ºF) for up to 22 hours. After removal from refrigerated conditions, the suspension may be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for up to 30 minutes prior to administration.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Subcutaneous Administration</span></p><p>To provide a homogeneous suspension, the contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension is achieved.</p><p>Azacitidine for injection suspension is administered subcutaneously. Rotate sites for each injection (thigh, abdomen, or upper arm). New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hard.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Suspension Stability</span></p><p>Azacitidine for injection reconstituted with non-refrigerated water for injection for subcutaneous administration may be stored for up to 1 hour at 25°C (77°F) or for up to 8 hours between 2° and 8°C (36° and 46°F); when reconstituted with refrigerated (2º to 8ºC, 36º to 46ºF) water for injection, it may be stored for 22 hours between 2° and 8°C (36° and 46°F).</p><h3>Instructions for Intravenous Administration</h3><p class="First">Reconstitute the appropriate number of azacitidine for injection vials to achieve the desired dose. Reconstitute each vial with 10 mL sterile water for injection. Vigorously shake or roll the vial until all solids are dissolved. The resulting solution will contain azacitidine 10 mg per mL. The solution should be clear. Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p><p>Withdraw the required amount of azacitidine for injection solution to deliver the desired dose and inject into a 50 -100 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringer's Injection.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Intravenous Solution Incompatibility</span></p><p>Azacitidine for injection is incompatible with 5% Dextrose solutions, Hespan, or solutions that contain bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of azacitidine for injection and should therefore be avoided.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Intravenous Administration</span></p><p>Azacitidine for injection solution is administered intravenously. Administer the total dose over a period of 10 to 40 minutes. The administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution of the azacitidine for injection vial.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Solution Stability</span></p><p>Azacitidine for injection reconstituted for intravenous administration may be stored at 25°C (77°F), but administration must be completed within 1 hour of reconstitution.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Azacitidine for Injection is supplied as a white to off-white lyophilized powder or lyophilized cake in 100 mg single-dose vials.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Advanced Malignant Hepatic Tumors</h3><p class="First">Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><h3>Hypersensitivity to Azacitidine or Mannitol</h3><p class="First">Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to azacitidine or mannitol.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Anemia, Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia</h3><p class="First">Azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Monitor complete blood counts frequently for response and/or toxicity, at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. After administration of the recommended dosage for the first cycle, adjust dosage for subsequent cycles based on nadir counts and hematologic response <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].</span></p><h3>Hepatotoxicity in Patients with Severe Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. Patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline albumin &lt;30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1)].</span> Monitor liver chemistries prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle.</p><p>Safety and effectiveness of azacitidine in patients with MDS and hepatic impairment have not been studied as these patients were excluded from the clinical trials.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Renal toxicity ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for nonMDS conditions. In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to &lt;20 mEq/L in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium &lt;3 mEq/L) developed in 5 patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes prior to initiation of therapy and with each cycle. If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate &lt;20 mEq/L or elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, reduce or hold the dose <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].</span></p><p>Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Also, azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. Therefore, monitor these patients closely for toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5)].</span> Patients with MDS and renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies.</p><h3>Tumor Lysis Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Azacitidine may cause fatal or serious tumor lysis syndrome, including in patients with MDS. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur despite concomitant use of allopurinol. Assess baseline risk and monitor and treat as appropriate.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Risk</h3><p class="First">Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, azacitidine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Azacitidine administered to pregnant rats via a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose approximating 8% of the recommended human daily dose caused fetal death and anomalies <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p>Advise females with reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during treatment with azacitidine <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]</span>. Men should be advised to not father a child while receiving treatment with azacitidine.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are described in other labeling sections:</p><ul class="Circle">

Study 1 was a supportive-care controlled trial (subcutaneous administration), Studies 2 and 3 were single arm studies (one with subcutaneous administration and one with intravenous administration), and Study 4 was an international randomized trial (subcutaneous administration) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><p>In Studies 1, 2 and 3, a total of 268 patients were exposed to azacitidine, including 116 exposed for 6 cycles (approximately 6 months) or more and 60 exposed for greater than 12 cycles (approximately one year). Azacitidine was studied primarily in supportive-care controlled and uncontrolled trials (n=150 and n=118, respectively). The population in the subcutaneous studies (n=220) was 23 to 92 years old (mean 66.4 years), 68% male, and 94% white, and had MDS or AML. The population in the intravenous study (n=48) was 35 to 81 years old (mean 63.1 years), 65% male, and 100% white. Most patients received average daily doses between 50 and 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.</p><p>In Study 4, a total of 175 patients with higher-risk MDS (primarily RAEB and RAEB-T subtypes) were exposed to azacitidine. Of these patients, 119 were exposed for 6 or more cycles, and 63 for at least 12 cycles. The mean age of this population was 68.1 years (ranging from 42 to 83 years), 74% were male, and 99% were white.

Adverse reactions that tended to be more pronounced during the first 1 to 2 cycles of subcutaneous treatment compared with later cycles included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema/pain/bruising/reaction, constipation, petechiae, dizziness, anxiety, hypokalemia, and insomnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in frequency over the course of treatment.</p><p>Overall, adverse reactions were qualitatively similar between the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the intravenous route of administration included infusion site reactions (e.g. erythema or pain) and catheter site reactions (e.g. infection, erythema, or hemorrhage).</p><p>In clinical studies of either subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine, the following serious adverse reactions occurring at a rate of &lt;5% (and not described in Tables 1 or 2) were reported:</p><p><span class="Bold">Blood and lymphatic system disorders:</span> agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, pancytopenia splenomegaly.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac disorders:</span> atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, cardio-respiratory arrest, congestive cardiomyopathy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Eye disorders:</span> eye hemorrhage</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal disorders:</span> diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, perirectal abscess.</p><p><span class="Bold">General disorders and administration site conditions:</span> catheter site hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, systemic inflammatory response syndrome.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatobiliary disorders:</span> cholecystitis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immune system disorders:</span> anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity.</p><p><span class="Bold">Infections and infestations:</span> abscess limb, bacterial infection, cellulitis, blastomycosis, injection site infection, Klebsiella sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia Klebsiella, sepsis, septic shock, Staphylococcal bacteremia, Staphylococcal infection, toxoplasmosis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and nutrition disorders:</span> dehydration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:</span> bone pain aggravated, muscle weakness, neck pain.</p><p><span class="Bold">Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified:</span> leukemia cutis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nervous system disorders:</span> cerebral hemorrhage, convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal and urinary disorders:</span> loin pain, renal failure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:</span> hemoptysis, lung infiltration, pneumonitis, respiratory distress.</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:</span> pyoderma gangrenosum, rash pruritic, skin induration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Surgical and medical procedures:</span> cholecystectomy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Vascular disorders:</span> orthostatic hypotension.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of azacitidine.

There is no known specific antidote for azacitidine overdosage.</p><h2>Azacitidine Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Azacitidine for Injection contains azacitidine, which is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is 4-amino-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-s-triazin-2(1H)-one. The structural formula is as follows:</p><p>The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">8</span>H<span class="Sub">12</span>N<span class="Sub">4</span>O<span class="Sub">5.</span> The molecular weight is 244. Azacitidine is a white to off-white solid. Azacitidine was found to be insoluble in acetone, ethanol, and methyl ethyl ketone; slightly soluble in ethanol/water (50/50), propylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol; sparingly soluble in water, water saturated octanol, 5% dextrose in water, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, normal saline and 5% Tween 80 in water; and soluble in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).</p><p>The finished product is supplied in a sterile form for reconstitution as a suspension for subcutaneous injection or reconstitution as a solution with further dilution for intravenous infusion. Vials of Azacitidine for Injection contain 100 mg of azacitidine and 100 mg mannitol as a sterile, white to off-white lyophilized powder or lyophilized cake.</p><h2>Azacitidine Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of azacitidine were studied in 6 MDS patients following a single 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> subcutaneous dose and a single 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> intravenous dose.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Azacitidine is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration; the peak plasma azacitidine concentration of 750 ± 403 ng/ml occurred in 0.5 hour.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The bioavailability of subcutaneous azacitidine relative to intravenous azacitidine is approximately 89%, based on area under the curve. Mean volume of distribution following intravenous dosing is 76 ± 26 L. Mean apparent subcutaneous clearance is 167 ± 49 L/hour and mean half-life after subcutaneous administration is 41 ± 8 minutes. The AUC and Cmax of subcutaneous administration of azacitidine in 21 patients with cancer were approximately dose proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> dose range. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Published studies indicate that urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine and its metabolites. Following intravenous administration of radioactive azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Fecal excretion accounted for &lt;1% of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following subcutaneous administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-azacitidine was 50%. The mean elimination half-lives of total radioactivity (azacitidine and its metabolites) were similar after intravenous and subcutaneous administrations, about 4 hours.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>In patients with cancer the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function (CLcr &gt;80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr &lt;30 mL/min) were compared following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse events. The exposure was similar to exposure in patients with normal renal function receiving 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. Therefore, a Cycle 1 dose modification is not recommended.</p><p>The effects of hepatic impairment, gender, age, or race on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been studied.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug-Drug Interactions</span></p><p>No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted.</p><p>An <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study of azacitidine incubation in human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine may be metabolized by the liver. Whether azacitidine metabolism may be affected by known microsomal enzyme inhibitors or inducers has not been studied.</p><p>An <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study with cultured human hepatocytes indicated that azacitidine at concentrations up to 100 μM (IV Cmax = 10.6 μM) does not cause any inhibition of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. The potential of azacitidine to inhibit other cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is not known.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies with human cultured hepatocytes indicate that azacitidine at concentrations of 1.0 μM to 100 μM does not induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4/5.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2.2 mg/kg (6.6 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) administered IP three times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine IP at 2.0 mg/kg (6.0 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, approximately 8% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) once a week for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (approximately 20%-80% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls.</p><p>The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8, Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro, WP3103P, WP3104P, and CC103; in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells; and in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells. Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells.</p><p>Administration of azacitidine to male mice at 9.9 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (approximately 9% the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15-30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (approximately 20%-40%, the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, and decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females. In a related study, male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on day 2 of gestation.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)</span></p><p>Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled trial carried out in 53 U.S. sites compared the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine plus supportive care with supportive care alone (“observation”) in patients with any of the five FAB subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). RA and RARS patients were included if they met one or more of the following criteria: required packed RBC transfusions; had platelet counts ≤50.0 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L; required platelet transfusions; or were neutropenic (ANC &lt;1.0 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L) with infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were not intended to be included. Supportive care allowed in this study included blood transfusion products, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics and antipyretics. The use of hematopoietic growth factors was prohibited. Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 3; the 2 groups were similar.</p><p>Azacitidine was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. The dose was increased to 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> if no beneficial effect was seen after 2 treatment cycles. The dose was decreased and/or delayed based on hematologic response or evidence of renal toxicity. Patients in the observation arm were allowed by protocol to cross over to azacitidine if they had increases in bone marrow blasts, decreases in hemoglobin, increases in red cell transfusion requirements, or decreases in platelets, or if they required a platelet transfusion or developed a clinical infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. For purposes of assessing efficacy, the primary endpoint was response rate (as defined in Table 4).</p><p>Of the 191 patients included in the study, independent review (adjudicated diagnosis) found that 19 had the diagnosis of AML at baseline. These patients were excluded from the primary analysis of response rate, although they were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients randomized. Approximately 55% of the patients randomized to observation crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment.</p><p>The overall response rate (CR + PR) of 15.7% in azacitidine-treated patients without AML (16.2% for all azacitidine randomized patients including AML) was statistically significantly higher than the response rate of 0% in the observation group (p&lt;0.0001) (Table 5). The majority of patients who achieved either CR or PR had either 2 or 3 cell line abnormalities at baseline (79%; 11/14) and had elevated bone marrow blasts or were transfusion dependent at baseline. Patients responding to azacitidine had a decrease in bone marrow blasts percentage, or an increase in platelets, hemoglobin or WBC. Greater than 90% of the responders initially demonstrated these changes by the 5<span class="Sup">th</span> treatment cycle. All patients who had been transfusion dependent became transfusion independent during PR or CR. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 512 and 330 days, respectively; 75% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML.</p><p>Patients in the observation group who crossed over to receive azacitidine treatment (47 patients) had a response rate of 12.8%.</p><p>Study 2, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of 72 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, CMMoL, or AML was also carried out. Treatment with subcutaneous azacitidine resulted in a response rate (CR + PR) of 13.9%, using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 810 and 430 days, respectively; 80% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of study involvement. In Study 3, another open-label, single-arm study of 48 patients with RAEB, RAEB-T, or AML, treatment with intravenous azacitidine resulted in a response rate of 18.8%, again using criteria similar to those described above. The mean and median duration of clinical response of PR or better was estimated as 389 and 281 days, respectively; 67% of the responding patients were still in PR or better at the time of completion of treatment. Response occurred in all MDS subtypes as well as in patients with adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML in both of these studies. Azacitidine dosage regimens in these 2 studies were similar to the regimen used in the controlled study.</p><p>Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered “improved.” About 24% of azacitidine-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days.</p><p>Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in MDS patients with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival.</p><p>The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38-88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML.</p><p>Azacitidine was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (which constituted one cycle of therapy). Patients continued treatment until disease progression, relapse after response, or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine patients were treated for a median of 9 cycles (range 1 to 39), BSC only patients for a median of 7 cycles (range 1 to 26), low dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4.5 cycles (range 1 to 15), and chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline patients for a median of 1 cycle (range 1 to 3, i.e. induction plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles).</p><p>In the Intent-to-Treat analysis, patients treated with azacitidine demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall survival as compared to patients treated with CCR (median survival of 24.5 months vs. 15.0 months; stratified log-rank p=0.0001). The hazard ratio describing this treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77).</p><p><span class="Bold">Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Death from Any Cause</span>: (Intent-to-Treat Population)</p><p>Key: AZA = azacitidine; CCR = conventional care regimens; CI = confidence interval; HR = Hazard Ratio</p><p>Azacitidine treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell transfusions (see Table 6). In patients treated with azacitidine who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became transfusion independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">1</span>A patient was considered RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period if the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more during the treatment period.
