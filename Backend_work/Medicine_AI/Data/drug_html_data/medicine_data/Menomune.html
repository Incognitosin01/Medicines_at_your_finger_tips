Primary Immunization</h3><p class="First">Primary immunization with Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine consists of a single 0.5mL dose administered subcutaneously. The preferred site of administration is the deltoid region.</p><p>The ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) has specfic recommendations for use of meningococcal vaccines. (1) (2) (3)</p><h3>. Revaccination</h3><p class="First">The ACIP has recommendations for revaccination against meningococcal disease for persons at high risk who were previously vaccinated with Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine. (1) (3) If Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine is used for revaccination, the dose is 0.5mL administered subcutaneously.</p><h2>3. DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First">Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine is supplied as a lyophilized vaccine, in a single dose or a multidose (10 dose) vial, with corresponding single dose or multidose vial of diluent. The lyophilized vaccine is reconstituted with the diluent [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>. After reconstitution, each dose consists of a 0.5mL suspension for injection. See <span class="Italics">Description (11)</span> for the complete listing of ingredients.</p><h2>4. CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><h3>. Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Do not administer to anyone with a history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine or any component of the vaccine [see <span class="Italics">Description (11)</span>].</span></p><h2>5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>. Latex</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The stoppers to the vials of lyophilized vaccine and diluent contain dry natural latex rubber that may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive persons.</span></p><h3>. Management of Acute Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Appropriate medical treatment must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of the vaccine.</p><h3>. Moderate or Severe Acute Illness</h3><p class="First">To avoid diagnostic confusion between manifestations of an acute illness and possible vaccine adverse effects, vaccination with Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine should be postponed in persons with moderate or severe acute illness. (4)</p><h3>. Limitations of Vaccine Effectivness</h3><p class="First">Menomune –A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine may not protect all recipients.</p><h3>. Altered Immunocompetence</h3><p class="First">Persons who are immunosuppressed, including persons receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may have a diminished immune response to Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions(7)].</span></p><h2>6. ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><h3>. Data from Clinical Studies</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>In three clinical trials primarily designed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of another vaccine, Menactra® [Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y, W-135) Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine], participants were randomized to receive Menactra or Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine, which was used as a control vaccine. In these three trials, 1519 children 2-10 years of age, 972 persons 11-18 years of age, and 1170 adults 18-55 years of age, respectively, received a dose of Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine. Overall, of the children 2-10 years of age who received Menactra or Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine, 68% were enrolled at US sites and 32% were enrolled at a Chilean site. The median ages of US and Chilean children were 6 and 5 years, respectively; 50.5% were males; and 92.0% were Caucasian. Among participants 11–55 years of age who received Menactra or Menomune – A/C/Y/ W-135 vaccine, all were enrolled at US sites; 54.8% were female; 87.7% were Caucasian.</p><p>Solicited local and systemic reactions were monitored daily for 7 days post-vaccination using a diary card. Information on serious adverse events was collected at interim clinic visits and by telephone interview conducted 6 months post-vaccination. At least 94% of participants from the three studies completed the 6-month follow-up.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Serious Adverse Events</span></p><p>Across the three studies, serious adverse events within 6-months following Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine were reported in 0.7% of 1519 children 2-10 years of age, 0.6% of 972 persons 11-18 years of age, and 1.7% of 1170 persons 18-55 years of age.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Solicited Adverse Events1</span></p><p>The most commonly reported solicited adverse events in US children 2-10 years of age were injection site pain, irritability and diarrhea. (Table 1)</p><p>The most commonly reported solicited adverse events in adolescents, ages 11 - 18 years, and adults, ages 18 - 55 years, were injection site pain, headache and fatigue. (Table 2)</p><h3>. Data from Post-Marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse events have been spontaneously reported during post-approval use of Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine since 1993 through November 2008. Because these events were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine exposure.</p><p>The following adverse events were included based on severity, frequency of reporting or the strength of causal association to Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine.</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>7. DRUG INTERACTIONS</h2><p class="First">Do not mix Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine with other vaccines in the same syringe or vial.</p><p>Immunosuppressive therapies may reduce the immune response to Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine.</p><p>No safety and immunogenicity data are available on the concomitant administration of Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine with other US licensed vaccines.</p><h2>8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>. Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine. It is also not known whether Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>. Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>. Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine in children below the age of 2 years have not been established.</p><p>During a meningococcal serogroup A epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, children 3 months to 16 years of age were vaccinated with a high molecular weight serogroup A/C meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. In case-control studies, after 1 year of observation, vaccine efficacy against meningococcal serogroup A disease was estimated to be 87% [(90% Confidence Interval (CI), 52% to 96%], overall. After 3 years, efficacy was estimated to be 67% (90% CI, 40% to 82%) among children who were 4-16 years of age at the time of vaccination and 8% (90% CI, -102% to 58%) among children who were 1-3 years of age at the time of vaccination. (5)</p><p>The efficacy of a serogroup C meningococcal vaccine in infants and young children was evaluated in a placebo-controlled trial during a serogroup C epidemic in Brazil. Vaccine efficacy was estimated to be 12% (95% CI, -55% to 62%) among children 6 to 23 months of age and 55% (95% CI, -4% to 72%) among children 24 to 36 months of age. (6)</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p><h2>11. DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135, Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine, Groups A, C, Y and W-135 Combined, is a vaccine for subcutaneous injection. Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine consists of a sterile lyophilized preparation of the group-specific polysaccharide antigens from <span class="Italics">N meningitidis</span>, Group A, Group C, Group Y and Group W-135. <span class="Italics">N meningitidis</span> are cultivated with Mueller Hinton agar (7) and Watson Scherp (8) media. The purified polysaccharide is extracted from the <span class="Italics">N meningitidis</span> cells and separated from the media by procedures which include centrifugation, detergent precipitation, alcohol precipitation, solvent or organic extraction and diafiltration. No preservative is added during manufacture.</p><p>The diluent (0.6 mL) for the single –dose presentation contains sterile, pyrogen-free distilled water without preservative. The diluent (6 mL) for the multi-dose presentation contains sterile, pyrogen-free distilled water and thimerosal, a mercury derivative, which is added as a preservative for the reconstituted vaccine. [See <span class="Italics">How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)</span>.]</p><p>After reconstitution with diluent the vaccine is a clear colorless liquid suspension. Each 0.5 mL dose contains 50 mcg of polysaccharide from each of serogroups A, C, Y and W-135. Reconstituted vaccine from a multi-dose vial also contains 25 mcg mercury per dose.</p><p>Each dose of vaccine contains 2.5 mg to 5 mg of lactose added as a stabilizer. (9)</p><p>Potency is evaluated by measuring the molecular size of each polysaccharide component using a column chromatography method as standardized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) (10) for Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine.</p><h2>12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3>. Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The presence of bactericidal anti-capsular meningococcal antibodies has been associated with protection from invasive meningococcal disease. (11) (12) Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine induces the production of bactericidal antibodies specific to the capsular polysaccharides of serogroups A, C, Y and W-135.</p><h2>13. NON-CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><h3>. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility</h3><p class="First">Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of fertility.</p><h2>14. CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First">Effectiveness of Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine was inferred by evaluating the proportion of children 2-10 years of age achieving a pre-specified level of serum bactericidal antibody and the proportion of persons 11-55 years of age achieving a 4-fold increase from baseline in serum bactericidal antibody, for each serogroup. Evidence for clinical efficacy against serogroup specific meningococcal disease in school-age children and adults has been obtained from historical field trials and observational studies with other high molecular weight polysaccharide vaccines containing meningococcal serogroup A and/or C components. (6) No studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines against disease due to serogroups Y and W-135.</p><p>Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine was used as the control vaccine in three US, multi-center, clinical trials designed primarily to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Menactra vaccine in children (2–10 years old), adolescents (11–18 years old), and adults (18–55 years old), respectively. In these trials, participants in the control arm received a dose of Menomune–A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine. Sera were obtained before and approximately 28 days after vaccination.</p><p>The Serum Bactericidal Assay (SBA) used to test sera contained an exogenous complement source that was either human (SBA-H) or, when correlated to SBA-H, baby rabbit (SBA-BR). (13)</p><p>Data on immune responses, as measured by SBA-H, following Menomune–A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine in a subset of children 2–10 years old are presented in Table 3. Data on immune responses, as measured by SBA-BR, following Menomune–A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine in adolescents and adults are presented in Table 4.</p><p>In participants 2-3 years of age with undetectable pre-vaccination SBA titers (ie, &lt;4 at Day 0), rates of seroconversion (defined as SBA titer ≥8 at Day 28) following Menomune-A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine were 55%, serogroup A (n=16/29); 30%, serogroup C (n=13/43); 57%, serogroup Y (n=17/30); 26%, serogroup W-135 (n=11/43).</p><p>In participants 4-10 years of age with undetectable pre-vaccination SBA titers (ie, &lt;4 at Day 0), rates of seroconversion (defined as SBA titer ≥8 at Day 28) following Menomune–A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine were 48%, serogroup A (n=10/21); 38%, serogroup C (n=19/50); 84%, serogroup Y (n=38/45); 68%, serogroup W-135 (n=26/38).</p><p>In participants 11-18 years of age with undetectable pre-vaccination SBA titers (ie, &lt;8 at Day 0), rates of seroconversion (defined as a ≥ 4-fold rise in Day 28 SBA titers) following Menomune-A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine were 100%, serogroup A (n=93/93); 99%, serogroup C (n=151/152); 100%, serogroup Y (n=47/47); 99%, serogroup W-135 (n=138/139).</p><p>In participants 18-55 years of age with undetectable pre-vaccination SBA titers (ie, &lt;8 at Day 0), rates of seroconversion (defined as a ≥ 4-fold rise in Day 28 SBA titers) following Menomune-A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine were 99%, serogroup A (n=143/144); 98%, serogroup C (n=297/304); 97%, serogroup Y (n=221/228); 99%, serogroup W-135 (n=325/328).</p><h2>15.
