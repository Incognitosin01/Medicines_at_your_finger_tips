</ul><h2>1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">1.1.    Skin tone improvement<br/>
1.2.    Treatment of face and neck wrinkles<br/>
1.3.    Stimulation of connective tissue metabolism.<br/>
<br/>
<br/></p><h2>2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">2.1.    <span class="Bold">Skin tone improvement for IM administration</span>: 1 vial 1-3 times a week according to severity and clinical progress.<br/>

After treatment, avoid alcohol containing disinfectants as they produce local irritation that appears unpleasant on face. In most cases, the slight irritation disappears within 2 hours.<br/>
5.2.    Skin disinfection is required before application. Saprophytic bacteria may produce injection site abscesses with improper skin preparation.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>6. ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First">6.1.    The most common mild adverse reaction is slight reddening at the injection site due to the mechanical effect of the needle or a superficial skin reaction of mild erythema.<br/></p><h2>7.

8.2    <span class="Bold">Nursing mothers</span>:    It is not known whether any of the ingredients in GUNA®- COLLAGEN  are  secreted  in  human milk.  However, since many drugs are secreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when GUNA®- COLLAGEN is administered to a nursing woman.<br/>

<br/></p><h2>9. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</h2><p class="First">9.1.    No Known.</p><h2>10. OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">10.1.    No Known.<br/></p><h2>11. DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">11.1.    GUNA®-COLLAGEN   is a sterile solution made with isotonic sodium chloride solution. The strength at 6X supports the physiological functions of collagen, as the homeopathic biological substrate acts as supporter of the endogenous production of collagen.  Application locally utilizing mesotherapy technique targets the area needing physiologic support. GUNA®-COLLAGEN shows a “flattening” effect on wrinkles, this improves as the protocol is continued; the effect  is   due  to improved metabolism in the  area of application not due to a filler effect.<br/>
<br/>
<br/></p><h2>12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">12.1.    <span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span><br/>
The medication acts through a low-dose enzymatic mechanism. Due to the homeopathic nature of the active ingredients, receptors are not blocked due to saturation of their active sites, rather there is a feed back regulation of the physiological metabolism of collagen.<br/>
12.2.    <span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics</span><br/>
The physiological effects of GUNA®-COLLAGEN are based on the activity of attenuated collagen that stimulates the metabolism of endogenous collagen.<br/>
In homeopathy there is no direct relationship between dose and effect, rather there is a relationship between attenuation and balancing effect on biochemical pathways.<br/>
12.3.    <span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span><br/>
The homeopathic attenuation  provides complete bioavability of the active ingredients.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><p class="First">13.1.    GUNA®-COLLAGEN has no level of toxicity due to the attenuation of the ingredients.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>14. CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First">14.1.    Collagen as an  injectable application is widely used for treatment of wrinkles. The use of the homeopathic attenuation is an extension of the traditional application, where the effect on wrinkles is due to improvement of the metabolism of the area of application not to a filling activity. The skin gets a shining and vitalizing aspect that lasts from 3 to 6 months after the end of the protocol, depending on the patient’s habits and skin situation before treatment.<br/></p><h2>15.
