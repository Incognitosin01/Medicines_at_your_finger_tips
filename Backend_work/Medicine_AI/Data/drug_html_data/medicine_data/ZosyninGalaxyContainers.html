</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Zosyn in Galaxy Containers</h2><h3>Intra-abdominal Infections</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">ZOSYN is indicated in adults and pediatric patients (2 months of age and older) for the treatment of appendicitis (complicated by rupture or abscess) and peritonitis caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span> or the following members of the <span class="Italics">Bacteroides fragilis</span> group: <span class="Italics">B. fragilis</span>, <span class="Italics">B. ovatus</span>, <span class="Italics">B. thetaiotaomicron</span>, or <span class="Italics">B. vulgatus</span>.</span></p><h3>Nosocomial Pneumonia</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">ZOSYN is indicated in adults and pediatric patients (2 months of age and older) for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia (moderate to severe) caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> and by piperacillin/tazobactam-susceptible <span class="Italics">Acinetobacter baumannii</span>, <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span>, <span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span>, and <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> (Nosocomial pneumonia caused by <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span> should be treated in combination with an aminoglycoside) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>.</span></p><h3>Skin and Skin Structure Infections</h3><p class="First">ZOSYN is indicated in adults for the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated skin and skin structure infections, including cellulitis, cutaneous abscesses and ischemic/diabetic foot infections caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span>.</p><h3>Female Pelvic Infections</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">ZOSYN is indicated in adults for the treatment of postpartum endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>.</span></p><h3>Community-acquired Pneumonia</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">ZOSYN is indicated in adults for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (moderate severity only) caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span>.</span></p><h3>Usage</h3><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZOSYN and other antibacterial drugs, ZOSYN should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Zosyn in Galaxy Containers Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage in Adult Patients With Indications Other Than Nosocomial Pneumonia</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The usual total daily dosage of ZOSYN for adult patients with indications other than nosocomial pneumonia is 3.375 g every six hours [totaling 13.5 g (12.0 g piperacillin/1.5 g tazobactam)], to be administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The usual duration of ZOSYN treatment is from 7 to 10 days.</span></p><h3>Dosage in Adult Patients With Nosocomial Pneumonia</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Initial presumptive treatment of adult patients with nosocomial pneumonia should start with ZOSYN at a dosage of 4.5 g every six hours plus an aminoglycoside, [totaling 18.0 g (16.0 g piperacillin/2.0 g tazobactam)], administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The recommended duration of ZOSYN treatment for nosocomial pneumonia is 7 to 14 days. Treatment with the aminoglycoside should be continued in patients from whom <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span> is isolated.</span></p><h3>Dosage in Adult Patients With Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">In adult patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min) and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of ZOSYN should be reduced based on the degree of renal impairment. The recommended daily dosage of ZOSYN for patients with renal impairment administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes is described in Table 1.</span></p><p>For patients on hemodialysis, the maximum dose is 2.25 g every twelve hours for all indications other than nosocomial pneumonia and 2.25 g every eight hours for nosocomial pneumonia. Since hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of the administered dose, an additional dose of 0.75 g ZOSYN (0.67 g piperacillin/0.08 g tazobactam) should be administered following each dialysis period on hemodialysis days. No additional dosage of ZOSYN is necessary for CAPD patients.</p><h3>Dosage in Pediatric Patients With Appendicitis/Peritonitis or Nosocomial Pneumonia</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The recommended dosage for pediatric patients with appendicitis and/or peritonitis or nosocomial pneumonia aged 2 months of age and older, weighing up to 40 kg, and with normal renal function, is described in Table 2 <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</span></p><p>Pediatric patients weighing over 40 kg and with normal renal function should receive the adult dose <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]</span>.</p><p>Dosage of ZOSYN in pediatric patients with renal impairment has not been determined.</p><h3>Reconstitution and Dilution of Powder Formulations</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacy bulk vials</span></p><p>Reconstituted stock solution must be transferred and further diluted for intravenous infusion.</p><p>The pharmacy bulk vial is for use in a hospital pharmacy admixture service only under a laminar flow hood. After reconstitution, entry into the vial must be made with a sterile transfer set or other sterile dispensing device, and contents should be dispensed as aliquots into intravenous solution using aseptic technique. Use entire contents of pharmacy bulk vial promptly. Discard unused portion after 24 hours if stored at room temperature (20°C to 25°C [68°F to 77°F]), or after 48 hours if stored at refrigerated temperature (2°C to 8°C [36°F to 46°F]).</p><p>Reconstitute the pharmacy bulk vial with exactly 152 mL of a compatible reconstitution diluent, listed below, to a concentration of 200 mg/mL of piperacillin and 25 mg/mL of tazobactam.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter or discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p><p class="First">Stability of ZOSYN Powder Formulations Following Reconstitution</p><p>ZOSYN reconstituted from bulk and single vials is stable in glass and plastic containers (plastic syringes, I.V. bags and tubing) when used with compatible diluents. The pharmacy bulk vial should <span class="Bold">NOT</span> be frozen after reconstitution. Discard unused portions after storage for 24 hours at room temperature or after storage for 48 hours at refrigerated temperature (2°C to 8°C [36°F to 46°F]).</p><p>Single dose or pharmacy vials should be used immediately after reconstitution. Discard any unused portion after 24 hours if stored at room temperature (20°C to 25°C [68°F to 77°F]), or after 48 hours if stored at refrigerated temperature (2°C to 8°C [36°F to 46°F]). Vials should not be frozen after reconstitution.</p><p>Stability studies in the I.V. bags have demonstrated chemical stability (potency, pH of reconstituted solution and clarity of solution) for up to 24 hours at room temperature and up to one week at refrigerated temperature. ZOSYN contains no preservatives. Appropriate consideration of aseptic technique should be used.</p><p>ZOSYN reconstituted from bulk and single vials can be used in ambulatory intravenous infusion pumps. Stability of ZOSYN in an ambulatory intravenous infusion pump has been demonstrated for a period of 12 hours at room temperature. Each dose was reconstituted and diluted to a volume of 37.5 mL or 25 mL. One-day supplies of dosing solution were aseptically transferred into the medication reservoir (I.V. bags or cartridge). The reservoir was fitted to a preprogrammed ambulatory intravenous infusion pump per the manufacturer's instructions. Stability of ZOSYN is not affected when administered using an ambulatory intravenous infusion pump.</p><h3>Directions for Use of Zosyn in Galaxy Containers</h3><p class="First">ZOSYN Injection is to be administered using sterile equipment, after thawing to room temperature.</p><p>ZOSYN containing EDTA is compatible for co-administration via a Y-site intravenous tube with Lactated Ringer's injection, USP.</p><p>Do <span class="Bold">NOT</span> add supplementary medication.</p><p>Unused portions of ZOSYN should be discarded.</p><p>Do <span class="Bold">NOT</span> use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Thawing of Plastic Container</span></p><p>Thaw frozen container at room temperature 20°C to 25°C [68°F to 77°F] or under refrigeration (2°C to 8°C [36°F to 46°F]). Do not force thaw by immersion in water baths or by microwave irradiation.</p><p>Check for minute leaks by squeezing container firmly. If leaks are detected, discard solution as sterility may be impaired.</p><p>The container should be visually inspected. Components of the solution may precipitate in the frozen state and will dissolve upon reaching room temperature with little or no agitation. Potency is not affected. Agitate after solution has reached room temperature. If after visual inspection, the solution remains cloudy or if an insoluble precipitate is noted or if any seals or outlet ports are not intact, the container should be discarded.</p><p>Administer by infusion over a period of at least 30 minutes. During the infusion it is desirable to discontinue the primary infusion solution.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Storage</span></p><p>Store in a freezer capable of maintaining a temperature of -20°C (-4°F).</p><p>For GALAXY Containers, the thawed solution is stable for 14 days under refrigeration (2°C to 8°C [36°F to 46°F]) or 24 hours at room temperature 20°C to 25°C [68°F to 77°F]. Do not refreeze thawed ZOSYN.</p><h3>Compatibility with Aminoglycosides</h3><p class="First">Due to the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> inactivation of aminoglycosides by piperacillin, ZOSYN and aminoglycosides are recommended for separate administration. ZOSYN and aminoglycosides should be reconstituted, diluted, and administered separately when concomitant therapy with aminoglycosides is indicated <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><p>In circumstances where co-administration via Y-site is necessary, ZOSYN formulations containing EDTA are compatible for simultaneous co-administration via Y-site infusion only with the following aminoglycosides under the following conditions:</p><p>Only the concentration and diluents for amikacin or gentamicin with the dosages of ZOSYN listed above have been established as compatible for co-administration via Y-site infusion. Simultaneous co-administration via Y-site infusion in any manner other than listed above may result in inactivation of the aminoglycoside by ZOSYN.</p><p>ZOSYN is not compatible with tobramycin for simultaneous co-administration via Y-site infusion. Compatibility of ZOSYN with other aminoglycosides has not been established.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">ZOSYN<span class="Sup">®</span> (piperacillin and tazobactam) Injection is supplied in GALAXY Containers as a frozen, iso-osmotic, sterile, non-pyrogenic solution in single-dose plastic containers:</p><p>2.25 g (piperacillin sodium equivalent to 2 g piperacillin and tazobactam sodium equivalent to 0.25 g tazobactam) in 50 mL.</p><p>3.375 g (piperacillin sodium equivalent to 3 g piperacillin and tazobactam sodium equivalent to 0.375 g tazobactam) in 50 mL.</p><p>4.5 g (piperacillin sodium equivalent to 4 g piperacillin and tazobactam sodium equivalent to 0.5 g tazobactam) in 100 mL.</p><p>ZOSYN<span class="Sup">®</span> (piperacillin and tazobactam) for Injection is a white to off-white powder in vials2:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">ZOSYN is contraindicated in patients with a history of allergic reactions to any of the penicillins, cephalosporins, or beta-lactamase inhibitors.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic/anaphylactoid) reactions (including shock) have been reported in patients receiving therapy with ZOSYN. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin, cephalosporin, or carbapenem hypersensitivity or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with ZOSYN, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions. If an allergic reaction occurs, ZOSYN should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><h3>Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">ZOSYN may cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely and ZOSYN discontinued if lesions progress.</p><h3>Hematologic Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Bleeding manifestations have occurred in some patients receiving beta-lactam drugs, including piperacillin. These reactions have sometimes been associated with abnormalities of coagulation tests such as clotting time, platelet aggregation and prothrombin time, and are more likely to occur in patients with renal failure. If bleeding manifestations occur, ZOSYN should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><p>The leukopenia/neutropenia associated with ZOSYN administration appears to be reversible and most frequently associated with prolonged administration.</p><p>Periodic assessment of hematopoietic function should be performed, especially with prolonged therapy, i.e., ≥ 21 days <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">As with other penicillins, ZOSYN may cause neuromuscular excitability or seizures. Patients receiving higher doses, especially patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for central nervous system adverse reactions. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment or seizure disorders for signs and symptoms of neuromuscular excitability or seizures <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</span></p><h3>Nephrotoxicity in Critically Ill Patients</h3><p class="First">The use of ZOSYN was found to be an independent risk factor for renal failure and was associated with delayed recovery of renal function as compared to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial in critically ill patients <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Based on this study, alternative treatment options should be considered in the critically ill population. If alternative treatment options are inadequate or unavailable, monitor renal function during treatment with ZOSYN <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><p>Combined use of piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin may be associated with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Electrolyte Effects</h3><p class="First">ZOSYN contains a total of 2.84 mEq (65 mg) of Na<span class="Sup">+</span> (sodium) per gram of piperacillin in the combination product. This should be considered when treating patients requiring restricted salt intake. Periodic electrolyte determinations should be performed in patients with low potassium reserves, and the possibility of hypokalemia should be kept in mind with patients who have potentially low potassium reserves and who are receiving cytotoxic therapy or diuretics.</p><h3>Clostridioides difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridioides difficile</span>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ZOSYN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing ZOSYN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Trials in Adult Patients</span></p><p>During the initial clinical investigations, 2621 patients worldwide were treated with ZOSYN in phase 3 trials. In the key North American monotherapy clinical trials (n=830 patients), 90% of the adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. However, in 3.2% of the patients treated worldwide, ZOSYN was discontinued because of adverse events primarily involving the skin (1.3%), including rash and pruritus; the gastrointestinal system (0.9%), including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; and allergic reactions (0.5%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nosocomial Pneumonia Trials</span></p><p>Two trials of nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections were conducted. In one study, 222 patients were treated with ZOSYN in a dosing regimen of 4.5 g every 6 hours in combination with an aminoglycoside and 215 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg/500 mg every 6 hours) in combination with an aminoglycoside. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 402 patients, 204 (91.9%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group and 198 (92.1%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group. Twenty-five (11.0%) patients in the piperacillin/tazobactam group and 14 (6.5%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group (p &gt; 0.05) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.</p><p>The second trial used a dosing regimen of 3.375 g given every 4 hours with an aminoglycoside.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Other Trials: Nephrotoxicity</span></p><p>In a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial in 1200 adult critically ill patients, piperacillin/tazobactam was found to be a risk factor for renal failure (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.43), and associated with delayed recovery of renal function as compared to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs<span class="Sup">1</span> <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><p class="First">Adverse Laboratory Changes (Seen During Clinical Trials)</p><p>Of the trials reported, including that of nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections in which a higher dose of ZOSYN was used in combination with an aminoglycoside, changes in laboratory parameters include:</p><p><span class="Italics">Hematologic</span>—decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit, thrombocytopenia, increases in platelet count, eosinophilia, leukopenia, neutropenia. These patients were withdrawn from therapy; some had accompanying systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, rigors, chills)</p><p><span class="Italics">Coagulation</span>—positive direct Coombs' test, prolonged prothrombin time, prolonged partial thromboplastin time</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic</span>—transient elevations of AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal</span>—increases in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen</p><p>Additional laboratory events include abnormalities in electrolytes (i.e., increases and decreases in sodium, potassium, and calcium), hyperglycemia, decreases in total protein or albumin, blood glucose decreased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, hypokalemia, and bleeding time prolonged.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>Clinical studies of ZOSYN in pediatric patients suggest a similar safety profile to that seen in adults.</p><p>In a prospective, randomized, comparative, open-label clinical trial of pediatric patients, 2 to 12 years of age, with intra-abdominal infections (including appendicitis and/or peritonitis), 273 patients were treated with ZOSYN 112.5 mg/kg given IV every 8 hours and 269 patients were treated with cefotaxime (50 mg/kg) plus metronidazole (7.5 mg/kg) every 8 hours. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 146 patients, 73 (26.7%) in the ZOSYN group and 73 (27.1%) in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group. Six patients (2.2%) in the ZOSYN group and 5 patients (1.9%) in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group discontinued due to an adverse event.</p><p>In a retrospective, cohort study, 140 pediatric patients 2 months to less than 18 years of age with nosocomial pneumonia were treated with ZOSYN and 267 patients were treated with comparators (which included ticarcillin-clavulanate, carbapenems, ceftazidime, cefepime, or ciprofloxacin). The rates of serious adverse reactions were generally similar between the ZOSYN and comparator groups, including patients aged 2 months to 9 months treated with ZOSYN 90 mg/kg IV every 6 hours and patients older than 9 months and less than 18 years of age treated with ZOSYN 112.5 mg/kg IV every 6 hours.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">In addition to the adverse drug reactions identified in clinical trials in Table 4 and Table 5, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ZOSYN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatobiliary</span>—hepatitis, jaundice</p><p><span class="Italics">Hematologic</span>—hemolytic anemia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune</span>—hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions (including shock)</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal</span>—interstitial nephritis</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous system disorders</span>—seizures</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric disorders—</span>delirium</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory</span>—eosinophilic pneumonia</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Appendages</span>—erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, (DRESS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), dermatitis exfoliative</p><p>Postmarketing experience with ZOSYN in pediatric patients suggests a similar safety profile to that seen in adults.</p><h3>Additional Experience with Piperacillin</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reaction has also been reported for piperacillin for injection:</p><p><span class="Italics">Skeletal</span>—prolonged muscle relaxation <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.5)].</span></p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Aminoglycosides</h3><p class="First">Piperacillin may inactivate aminoglycosides by converting them to microbiologically inert amides.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">In vivo</span> inactivation</span><span class="Italics">:</span></p><p>When aminoglycosides are administered in conjunction with piperacillin to patients with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, the concentrations of the aminoglycosides (especially tobramycin) may be significantly reduced and should be monitored.</p><p>Sequential administration of ZOSYN and tobramycin to patients with either normal renal function or mild to moderate renal impairment has been shown to modestly decrease serum concentrations of tobramycin but no dosage adjustment is considered necessary.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> inactivation</span>:</p><p>Due to the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> inactivation of aminoglycosides by piperacillin, ZOSYN and aminoglycosides are recommended for separate administration. ZOSYN and aminoglycosides should be reconstituted, diluted, and administered separately when concomitant therapy with aminoglycosides is indicated. ZOSYN, which contains EDTA, is compatible with amikacin and gentamicin for simultaneous Y-site infusion in certain diluents and at specific concentrations. ZOSYN is not compatible with tobramycin for simultaneous Y-site infusion <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]</span>.</p><h3>Probenecid</h3><p class="First">Probenecid administered concomitantly with ZOSYN prolongs the half-life of piperacillin by 21% and that of tazobactam by 71% because probenecid inhibits tubular renal secretion of both piperacillin and tazobactam. Probenecid should not be co-administered with ZOSYN unless the benefit outweighs the risk.</p><h3>Vancomycin</h3><p class="First">Studies have detected an increased incidence of acute kidney injury in patients concomitantly administered piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin as compared to vancomycin alone <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><p>Monitor kidney function in patients concomitantly administered with piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin.</p><p>No pharmacokinetic interactions have been noted between piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin.</p><h3>Anticoagulants</h3><p class="First">Coagulation parameters should be tested more frequently and monitored regularly during simultaneous administration of high doses of heparin, oral anticoagulants, or other drugs that may affect the blood coagulation system or the thrombocyte function <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Vecuronium</h3><p class="First">Piperacillin when used concomitantly with vecuronium has been implicated in the prolongation of the neuromuscular blockade of vecuronium. ZOSYN could produce the same phenomenon if given along with vecuronium. Due to their similar mechanism of action, it is expected that the neuromuscular blockade produced by any of the non-depolarizing muscle relaxants could be prolonged in the presence of piperacillin. Monitor for adverse reactions related to neuromuscular blockade (see package insert for vecuronium bromide).</p><h3>Methotrexate</h3><p class="First">Limited data suggests that co-administration of methotrexate and piperacillin may reduce the clearance of methotrexate due to competition for renal secretion. The impact of tazobactam on the elimination of methotrexate has not been evaluated. If concurrent therapy is necessary, serum concentrations of methotrexate as well as the signs and symptoms of methotrexate toxicity should be frequently monitored.</p><h3>Effects on Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of positive test results using the Bio-Rad Laboratories Platelia Aspergillus EIA test in patients receiving piperacillin/tazobactam injection who were subsequently found to be free of Aspergillus infection. Cross-reactions with non-Aspergillus polysaccharides and polyfuranoses with the Bio-Rad Laboratories Platelia Aspergillus EIA test have been reported. Therefore, positive test results in patients receiving piperacillin/tazobactam should be interpreted cautiously and confirmed by other diagnostic methods.</p><p>As with other penicillins, the administration of ZOSYN may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine using a copper-reduction method (CLINITEST<span class="Sup">®</span>).

</ul><h2>Zosyn in Galaxy Containers - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">ZOSYN is an antibacterial drug <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacodynamic parameter for piperacillin/tazobactam that is most predictive of clinical and microbiological efficacy is time above MIC.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The mean and coefficients of variation (CV%) for the pharmacokinetic parameters of piperacillin and tazobactam after multiple intravenous doses are summarized in Table 7.</p><p>Peak plasma concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam are attained immediately after completion of an intravenous infusion of ZOSYN. Piperacillin plasma concentrations, following a 30-minute infusion of ZOSYN, were similar to those attained when equivalent doses of piperacillin were administered alone. Steady-state plasma concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam were similar to those attained after the first dose due to the short half-lives of piperacillin and tazobactam.</p><p class="First">Distribution</p><p>Both piperacillin and tazobactam are approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. The protein binding of either piperacillin or tazobactam is unaffected by the presence of the other compound. Protein binding of the tazobactam metabolite is negligible.</p><p>Piperacillin and tazobactam are widely distributed into tissues and body fluids including intestinal mucosa, gallbladder, lung, female reproductive tissues (uterus, ovary, and fallopian tube), interstitial fluid, and bile. Mean tissue concentrations are generally 50% to 100% of those in plasma. Distribution of piperacillin and tazobactam into cerebrospinal fluid is low in subjects with non-inflamed meninges, as with other penicillins (see Table 8).</p><p class="First">Metabolism</p><p>Piperacillin is metabolized to a minor microbiologically active desethyl metabolite. Tazobactam is metabolized to a single metabolite that lacks pharmacological and antibacterial activities.</p><p class="First">Excretion</p><p>Following single or multiple ZOSYN doses to healthy subjects, the plasma half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam ranged from 0.7 to 1.2 hours and was unaffected by dose or duration of infusion.</p><p>Both piperacillin and tazobactam are eliminated via the kidney by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Piperacillin is excreted rapidly as unchanged drug with 68% of the administered dose excreted in the urine. Tazobactam and its metabolite are eliminated primarily by renal excretion with 80% of the administered dose excreted as unchanged drug and the remainder as the single metabolite. Piperacillin, tazobactam and desethyl piperacillin are also secreted into the bile.</p><p class="First">Specific Populations</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>After the administration of single doses of piperacillin/tazobactam to subjects with renal impairment, the half-life of piperacillin and of tazobactam increases with decreasing creatinine clearance. At creatinine clearance below 20 mL/min, the increase in half-life is twofold for piperacillin and fourfold for tazobactam compared to subjects with normal renal function. Dosage adjustments for ZOSYN are recommended when creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min in patients receiving the usual recommended daily dose of ZOSYN. <span class="Italics">See Dosage and Administration (2)</span> for specific recommendations for the treatment of patients with renal -impairment.</p><p>Hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of a piperacillin/tazobactam dose with an additional 5% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. Peritoneal dialysis removes approximately 6% and 21% of the piperacillin and tazobactam doses, respectively, with up to 16% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite.

The piperacillin clearance estimate is 80% of this value for pediatric patients 2 – 9 months old. In patients younger than 2 months of age, clearance of piperacillin is slower compared to older children; however, it is not adequately characterized for dosing recommendations. The population mean (SE) for piperacillin volume of distribution is 0.243 (0.011) L/kg and is independent of age.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Geriatrics</span></p><p>The impact of age on the pharmacokinetics of piperacillin and tazobactam was evaluated in healthy male subjects, aged 18 – 35 years (n=6) and aged 65 to 80 years (n=12).
