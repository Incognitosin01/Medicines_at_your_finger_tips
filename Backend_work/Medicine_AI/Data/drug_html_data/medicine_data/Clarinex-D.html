Histamine can cause itching, sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes.</p><p>The pseudoephedrine causes narrowing of blood vessels. This leads to clearing of nasal congestion, but it may also cause an increase in blood pressure in patients who have high blood pressure.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><p><i>Do not give any over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicine to a baby or child under 4 years of age.</i> Using these medicines in very young children might cause serious or possibly life-threatening side effects .</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Clarinex-D</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
