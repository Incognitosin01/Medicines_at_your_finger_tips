Thalidomide is also used to treat and prevent moderate to severe skin lesions caused by leprosy.</p><p>Thalidomide is available only in a 28-day supply from a certified pharmacy under a special program. You must be registered in the program and agree to use birth control as required.</p><p>Thalidomide may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Never use  thalidomide if you are pregnant. Even one dose of thalidomide can cause severe, life-threatening birth defects or death of a baby if the mother or the father is taking this medicine at the time of conception or during pregnancy.</b></p><p>Both men and women using this medicine should use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy during treatment, and for up to 4 weeks after your last dose.</p><p>Thalidomide may cause blood clots. Stop using this medicine and call your doctor at once if you have symptoms such as sudden numbness, severe headache, problems with vision or speech, chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your arm or leg.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use thalidomide if you are allergic to it.</p><p><b>Thalidomide can cause severe, life-threatening birth defects or death of a baby if the mother or the father is taking this medicine at the time of conception or during pregnancy.</b> Even one dose of thalidomide can cause major birth defects of the baby's arms and legs, bones, ears, eyes, face, and heart. <b>Never use thalidomide if you are pregnant.</b> Tell your doctor right away if your period is late while taking thalidomide.</p><p><b>For Women:</b> If you have not had a hysterectomy, you will be required to use two reliable forms of birth control beginning 4 weeks before you start taking thalidomide and ending 4 weeks after you stop taking it. Even women with fertility problems are required to use birth control while taking thalidomide. You must also have a negative pregnancy test at 10 to 14 days before treatment and again at 24 hours before. While you are taking thalidomide, you will have a pregnancy test every 2 to 4 weeks.</p><p>Your birth control method must be proven highly effective, such as birth control pills, an intrauterine device (IUD), a tubal ligation, or a sexual partner's vasectomy. The extra form of birth control you use must be a barrier method such as a condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, or contraceptive sponge.</p><p><b>Stop using thalidomide and call your doctor at once if you quit using birth control, if your period is late, or if you think you might be pregnant.</b> Not having sexual intercourse (abstinence) is the most effective method of preventing pregnancy.</p><p><b>For Men:</b> Use a condom to prevent pregnancy during your treatment, and for up to 4 weeks after you stop taking it. You must always use latex condoms when having sex with a woman who is able to get pregnant, even if you have had a vasectomy. <b>Call your doctor if you have had unprotected sex, even once, or if you think your female sexual partner may be pregnant.</b></p><p>Treatment with thalidomide may increase your risk of a blood clot or stroke during treatment for multiple myeloma.
