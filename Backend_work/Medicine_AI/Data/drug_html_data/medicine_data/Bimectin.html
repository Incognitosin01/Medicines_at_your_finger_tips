To prevent removal of special lubricants from the Protector Drench Gun, the gun and tubing must not be washed.</p><p><span class="Italics">Free standing 338 fl. oz./10 Liter bottle and 676 fl. oz./20 Liter bottle</span><br/></p><p>Connect the applicator gun to the 338 fl. oz./10 L and 676 fl. oz./20 L bottle as follows: Attach the open end of the draw-off tubing to the dosing equipment.

Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells.  This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite.  Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channel, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).  The margin of safety of compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that mammals do not have the glutamate-gated chloride channel, the macrocyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated chloride channel and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.<br/></p><h2>Animal Safety</h2><p class="First">Studies conducted in the U.S.A. have demonstrated the safety margin of ivermectin.  Based on the plasma levels, the topically applied formulation is expected to be at least as well tolerated by breeding animals as is the subcutaneous formulation which had no effect on breeding performance.<br/></p><h2>Residue Information</h2><p class="First">Cattle must not be treated within 48 days of slaughter for human consumption.  Because a withdrawal time in milk has not been established, do not use in female dairy cattle of breeding age.  A withdrawal period has not been established for this product in pre-ruminating calves.   Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.<br/></p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING!  NOT FOR USE IN HUMANS.</span></p><p>The product should not be applied to self or others because it may be irritating to human skin and eyes and absorbed through the skin.  To minimize accidental skin contact, the user should wear a long-sleeved shirt and rubber gloves.  If accidental skin contact occurs, wash immediately with soap and water.  If accidental eye exposure occurs, flush eyes immediately with water and seek medical attention.</p><p><span class="Bold">Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children.</span></p><p>The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) contains more detailed occupational safety information.  To report advers effects, obtain an MSDS or for assistance contact Bimeda, Inc. at 1-888-524-6332.</p><p><span class="Bold">WARNING!  FLAMMABLE!</span></p><p><span class="Bold">KEEP AWAY FROM HEAT, SPARKS, OPEN FLAME, AND OTHER SOURCES OF IGNITION.<br/></span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><h2>Environmental Safety</h2><p class="First">Studies indicate that when ivermectin comes in contact with soil, it readily and tightly binds too the soil and becomes inactive over time.  Free ivermectin may adversely affect fish or certain aquatic  organisms.  Do not permit cattle to enter lakes, streams, or ponds for at least 6 hours after treatment.  Do not contaminate water by direct application or by the improper disposal of drug containers.  Dispose of containers in an approved landfill or by incineration.<br/></p><p>As with other avermectins, ivermectin is excreted in the dung or treated animals and can inhibit the reproduction and growth of pest and beneficial insects that use dung as a source of food and for reproduction.  The magnitude and duration of such effects are species and life-cycle specific.  When used according to label directions, the product is not expected to have an adverse impact on populations of dung-dependant insects.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Package Information</h2><p class="First">Bimectin (ivermectin) Pour-On is available in a 33.8 fl oz/1 liter bottle with a measure-pour system, an 84.5 fl. oz/2.5 Liter, a 169 fl. oz/5 Liter, a 338 fl. oz/10 Liter bottle and a 676 fl. oz./20 Liter bottle intended for use with appropriate automatic dosing equipment.<br/></p><h2>Package Label Display Panel</h2><p class="First">Bimectin</p><p>(ivermectin)</p><p>Pour-On for Cattle</p><p>Contains 5 mg ivermectin/mL</p><p>Parasiticide</p><p>Kills:  Roundworms (including Brown Stomach Worm), Lungworms, Grubs, Sucking Lice, Biting Lice, Mange Mites, Horn Flies</p><p>Net Contents:  169 fl oz (5 Liter)</p><p>WARNING!
