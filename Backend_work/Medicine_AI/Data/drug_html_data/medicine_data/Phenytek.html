Your doctor will need to check your progress at regular visits. Your family or other caregivers should also be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms.</p><p>Seizure control is very important during pregnancy. <b>Do not start or stop taking  Phenytek without your doctor's advice if you are pregnant.</b> Phenytek may harm an unborn baby, but having a seizure during pregnancy could harm both mother and baby. <b>Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant while taking this medicine.</b></p><p>If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry to track the effects of phenytoin on the baby.</p><p>If you have taken Phenytek during pregnancy, be sure to tell the doctor who delivers your baby about your this medicine use. Both you and the baby may need to receive medications to prevent excessive bleeding during delivery and just after birth.</p><p>Phenytek can make birth control pills less effective. Ask your doctor about using a non-hormonal birth control (condom, diaphragm with spermicide) to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>It may not be safe to breast-feed while using this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take  Phenytek?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Swallow an <b>extended-release capsule</b> whole and do not crush, chew, break, or open it.</p><p>Phenytek chewable tablets are not for once-per-day dosing. You must take them 2 or 3 times per day. Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully.</p><p>Shake the <b>oral suspension</b> (liquid) before you measure a dose. Use the dosing syringe provided, or use a medicine dose-measuring device (not a kitchen spoon).</p><p>You may need frequent blood tests. You may also need a blood test when switching from one form of phenytoin to another. Visit your doctor regularly.</p><p>Tell your doctor if Phenytek does not seem to work as well in controlling your seizures. Do not stop using this medicine suddenly, even if you feel fine. Stopping suddenly may cause increased seizures. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.</p><p>In case of emergency, wear or carry medical identification to let others know you have seizures.</p><p>Phenytek can cause swelling in your gums. Brush and floss your teeth and visit your dentist regularly to help prevent this problem.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, light, and heat.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose.
